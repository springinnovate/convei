TI  - Deep-learning-based burned area mapping using the synergy of Sentinel-1&2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Around 350 million hectares of land are affected by wildfires every year influencing the health of ecosystems and leaving a trail of destruction. Accurate information over burned areas (BA) is essential for governments and communities to prioritize recovery actions. Prior research over the past decades has established the potentials and limitations of space-borne earth observation for mapping BA over large geographic areas at various scales. The operational deployment of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 constellations significantly improved the quality and quantity of the imagery from the microwave (C-band) and optical regions on the spectrum. Based on that, this study set to investigate whether the existing coarse BA products can be further improved by the synergy of optical surface reflectance (SR), radar backscatter coefficient (BS), and/or radar interferometric coherence (COR) data with higher spatial resolutions. A Siamese Self-Attention (SSA) classification strategy is proposed for the multi-sensor BA mapping and a multi-source dataset is constructed at the object level for the training and testing. Results are analyzed by test sites, feature sources, and classification strategies to appraise the improvements achieved by the proposed method.

TI  - An autoencoder-based model for forest disturbance detection using Landsat time series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and classifying disturbed forests can provide information support for not only sustainable forest management but also global carbon sequestration assessments. In this study, we propose an autoencoder-based model for forest disturbance detection, which considers disturbances as anomalous events in forest temporal trajectories. The autoencoder network is established and trained to reconstruct intact forest trajectories. Then, the disturbance detection threshold is derived by Tukey's method based on the reconstruction error of the intact forest trajectory. The assessment result shows that the model using the NBR time series performs better than the NDVI-based model, with an overall accuracy of 90.3%. The omission and commission errors of disturbed forest are 7% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the trained NBR-based model is implemented in two test areas, with overall accuracies of 87.2% and 86.1%, indicating the robustness and scalability of the model. Moreover, comparing three common methods, the proposed model performs better, especially for intact forest detection accuracy. This study provides a novel and robust approach with acceptable accuracy for forest disturbance detection, enabling forest disturbance to be identified in regions with limited disturbance reference data.

TI  - Arterial blood supply patterning of the mammary sentinel lymph nodes with special reference to the relation of the formation mechanism of the superficial subscapular artery
T2  - ANATOMICAL SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to conduct a detailed anatomical examination of the arterial supply to level Ib lymph nodes corresponding to mammary sentinel lymph nodes. This was achieved by focusing on the relationship with course changes of the axillary artery trunk using 41 cadavers (49 axillae). The course patterns of the axillary artery were classified as: "Standard type," which penetrate the brachial plexus (occurrence rate, 51%); "Superficial brachial artery type," which ran along the superficial layer of the brachial plexus (2%); "Superficial subscapular artery (SSbsA) type," which entered the deep layer without penetrating the brachial plexus (42.9%); and others (4.1%). The lateral thoracic artery, thoracodorsal artery, inferior pectoral artery, and superficial thoracic artery were distributed in a regular pair relationship according to each running type of the axillary artery for the Ib lymph nodes. Comparing blood supply ratio to the Ib lymph nodes, using SSbsA occurrence as a reference, showed that significant differences were observed with the inferior pectoral artery control for the standard subscapular artery group and the lateral thoracic artery control for the SSbsA group (p < 0.0001). It was suggested that in selective modeling of vascular networks during upper limb developments, two formation tendencies occur. The standard axillary and SSbsA axillary artery trunks are induced when the inferior pectoral artery-derived feeding arteries in the superficial brachial artery system are selected for Ib lymph nodes, or lateral thoracic artery-derived feeding arteries, which are closely related to the SSbsA pathway, are acquired.

TI  - Assessing the conservation status, biodiversity potentials and economic contribution of urban tree Ecosystems in Nigerian Cities
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated conservation status, biodiversity potentials and economic contribution of urban tree Ecosystems in Nigerian cities. A total of 32 families were encountered respectively in Makurdi (17), Ilorin (18) and Lokoja (25) urban forests. The diversity index, richness and evenness of the tree species were in the order Ilorin > Lokoja > Makurdi urban forests and decreased as the population of the city increased, suggesting that the urban forests and trees depends on city infrastructure development. About 32% of tree species in the three cities are threatened tree species in Nigeria and based on the IUCN red list. This situation therefore calls for urgent conservation measures. Moreover, results showed a general increasing trend in Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) value between year 2000 and 2018 for the vegetation cover in each city. The NDVI value for Makurdi was (0.23 to 0.37), Ilorin (0.42 to 0.47), and Lokoja (0.01 to 0.27), which was very low compared to forest cover NDVI. The NDVI could be used to observe the changes in vegetation greenness and the dynamic effects of temperature. The average monthly income obtained by those involved in the sales of urban tree products such as (vegetables, fruits, recreation parks, event centres, amusement parks) 20,000 (56 USD) to over 50,000 (139 USD) contributed between 40 and 70% to household annual income. This was particularly important in augmenting income from other sources in meeting basic family expenses in the cities.

TI  - Assessment of glacier status and its controlling parameters from 1990 to 2018 of Hunza Basin, Western Karakorum
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice masses and snow of Hunza River Basin (HRB) are an important primary source of fresh water and lifeline for downstream inhabitants. Changing climatic conditions seriously put an impact on these available ice and snow masses. These glaciers may affect downstream population by glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and surge events due to climatic variation. So, monitoring of these glaciers and available ice masses is important. This research delivers an approach for dynamics of major glaciers of the Hunza River Basin. We delineated 27 major glaciers of HRB and examined their status by using Landsat (OLI, ETM+, ETM, TM), digital elevation model (DEM) over the period of 1990-2018. In 1990, the total area covered by these glaciers is about 2589.75 +/- 86 km(2) and about 2565.12 +/- 68km(2) in 2018. Our results revealed that from 2009 to 2015, glacier coverage of HRB advanced with a mean annual advance rate of 2.22 +/- 0.1 km(2) a(-1). Conversely, from 1994 to 1999, the strongest reduction in glacier area with a mean rate of - 3.126 +/- 0.3 km(2) a(-1) is recorded. The glaciers of HRB are relatively stable compared to Hindukush, Himalayan, and Tibetan Plateau region of the world. The steep slope glacier's retreat rate is more than that of gentle slope glaciers, and the glaciers below an elevation of 5000 m above sea level change significantly. Based on climate data from 1995 to 2018, HRB shows a decreasing trend in temperature and increasing precipitation. The glacier area's overall retreat is due to an increase in summer temperature while the glacier advancement is induced possibly by winter and autumn precipitation.

TI  - Risk Diagrams Based on Primary Care Electronic Medical Records and Linked Real-Time PCR Data to Monitor Local COVID-19 Outbreaks During the Summer 2020: A Prospective Study Including 7,671,862 People in Catalonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring transmission is a prerequisite for containing COVID-19. We report on effective potential growth (EPG) as a novel measure for the early identification of local outbreaks based on primary care electronic medical records (EMR) and PCR-confirmed cases. Secondly, we studied whether increasing EPG precedes local hospital and intensive care (ICU) admissions and mortality. Population-based cohort including all Catalan citizens' PCR tests, hospitalization, intensive care (ICU) and mortality between 1/07/2020 and 13/09/2020; linked EMR covering 88.6% of the Catalan population was obtained. Nursing home residents were excluded. COVID-19 counts were ascertained based on EMR and PCRs separately. Weekly empirical propagation (rho(7)) and 14-day cumulative incidence (A(14)) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated at care management area (CMA) level, and combined as EPG = rho(7) x A(14). Overall, 7,607,201 and 6,798,994 people in 43 CMAs were included for PCR and EMR measures, respectively. A14, rho(7), and EPG increased in numerous CMAs during summer 2020. EMR identified 2.70-fold more cases than PCRs, with similar trends, a median (interquartile range) 2 (1) days earlier, and better precision. Upticks in EPG preceded increases in local hospital admissions, ICU occupancy, and mortality. Increasing EPG identified localized outbreaks in Catalonia, and preceded local hospital and ICU admissions and subsequent mortality. EMRs provided similar estimates to PCR, but some days earlier and with better precision. EPG is a useful tool for the monitoring of community transmission and for the early identification of COVID-19 local outbreaks.

TI  - Mapping essential urban land use categories (EULUC) using geospatial big data: Progress, challenges, and opportunities
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use information that reflects socio-economic functions and human activities is critically essential for urban planning, landscape design, environmental management, health promotion, and biodiversity conservation. Land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) have facilitated a wide spectrum of applications and further triggered new opportunities in urban studies. New and improved Earth observations, algorithms, and advanced products for extracting thematic urban information, in association with emerging social sensing big data and auxiliary crowdsourcing datasets, all together offer great potentials to mapping fine-resolution EULUC from regional to global scales. Here we review the advances of EULUC mapping research and practices in terms of their data, methods, and applications. Based on the historical retrospect, we summarize the challenges and limitations of current EULUC studies regarding sample collection, mixed land use problem, data and model generalization, and large-scale mapping efforts. Finally, we propose and discuss future opportunities, including cross-scale mapping, optimal integration of multi-source features, global sample libraries from crowdsourcing approaches, advanced machine learning and ensembled classification strategy, open portals for data visualization and sharing, multi-temporal mapping of EULUC change, and implications in urban environmental studies, to facilitate multi-scale fine-resolution EULUC mapping research.

TI  - Estimating half-hourly solar radiation over the Continental United States using GOES-16 data with iterative random forest
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To reduce carbon emissions, using more solar energy is a feasible solution. Many meteorological-based models can estimate global downward solar radiation (DSR), but they are with limited applications due to the point-based estimation and low temporal resolution. Satellite remote sensing-based models can estimate DSR with better spatial coverage. However, most previous models are restricted to estimate clear-sky or monthly scale DSR at several sites, limiting the solar energy monitoring of nationwide scale. In this study, using high spatiotemporal resolution Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-16 satellite data, an iterative random forest (RF) model was developed to estimate and map half-hourly DSR at 1-km spatial resolution over the Continental United States (CONUS). The results show that the iterative RF model performed better than multiple linear regression (MLR) and traditional RF models. The accuracy of estimating half-hourly DSR is that R-2 = 0.95, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 66.92 W/m(2), and mean-bias-error (MBE) = 0.06 W/m(2). Half-hourly and daily DSR with spatial resolution 1-km over the CONUS were mapped. The GOES-16 estimated DSR showed the similar spatial patterns with the results from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) DSR product. This study demonstrated the potential of GOES-16 data for mapping DSR over the CONUS, and hence can be further used in solar energy related applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Divergent impacts of atmospheric water demand on gross primary productivity in three typical ecosystems in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water demand is practically characterized as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and has been identified as a critical driver of ecosystem function, by affecting plant mortality, wildfires, and carbon loss. In this study, we used daily eddy covariance data across Chinese forest, grassland and shrubland ecosystems, in combination with remote sensing data, to investigate the impacts of VPD on gross primary productivity (GPP). We found divergent VPD impacts on GPP among grassland, shrubland and forest ecosystems. The VPD yielded substantial inhibitory impacts on GPP in grassland ecosystems and this suppressing impact was regulated by soil water content (SWC), showing that GPP declined with VPD under dry conditions but increased with VPD under wet conditions. This GPP variance was attributed to VPD, SWC and their interactions. More than 50% of the variability in GPP was explained by SWC in grassland ecosystems and by VPD in forest and shrubland ecosystems. Partial correlation analysis, random forest, and multiple linear regression revealed similar results when temperature, radiation and SWC were considered. Compared with shrubland and forest ecosystems, grassland has drier environmental conditions and poorer soil water-holding capacity that led to lower SWC and stronger negative impacts on VPD. Thus, GPP was susceptible to the negative impacts of higher VPD, especially under dryness stress. Our results highlight the need to comprehensively consider divergent VPD impacts for different ecosystems to more accurately assess climate impacts on ecosystem function.

TI  - The <i>miR166</i>-<i>SlHB15A</i> regulatory module controls ovule development and parthenocarpic fruit set under adverse temperatures in tomato
T2  - MOLECULAR PLANT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fruit set is inhibited by adverse temperatures, with consequences on yield. We isolated a tomato mutant producing fruits under non-permissive hot temperatures and identified the causal gene as SlHB15A, belonging to class III homeodomain leucine-zipper transcription factors. SlHB15A loss-of-function mutants display aberrant ovule development that mimics transcriptional changes occurring in fertilized ovules and leads to parthenocarpic fruit set under optimal and non-permissive temperatures, in field and greenhouse conditions. Under cold growing conditions, SlHB15A is subjected to conditional haploinsufficiency and recessive dosage sensitivity controlled by microRNA 166 (miR166). Knockdown of SlHB15A alleles by miR166 leads to a continuum of aberrant ovules correlating with parthenocarpic fruit set. Consistent with this, plants harboring an Slhb15a-miRNA166-resistant allele developed normal ovules and were unable to set parthenocarpic fruit under cold conditions. DNA affinity purification sequencing and RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that SlHB15A is a bifunctional transcription factor expressed in the ovule integument. SlHB15A binds to the promoters of auxin-related genes to repress auxin signaling and to the promoters of ethylene-related genes to activate their expression. A survey of tomato genetic biodiversity identified pat and pat-1, two historical parthenocarpic mutants, as alleles of SlHB15A. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the role of SlHB15A as a sentinel to prevent fruit set in the absence of fertilization and provide a mean to enhance fruiting under extreme temperatures.

TI  - Use of satellite imagery to identify southern right whales (<i>Eubalaena australis</i>) on a Southwest Atlantic Ocean breeding ground
T2  - MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery has been used to improve scientific research worldwide. In this study, the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) was chosen to test the use of medium, high, and very high resolution (VHR) satellite images, on the Brazilian breeding ground. These images were used to identify the whales and were compared to aerial survey data collected in the same area. The VHR satellite images from the Pleiades-1A satellite, available on Google Earth, displayed the best results when compared to those from Sentinel 2, Landsat 8, Rapid Eye, and Planet Scope. No significant differences were observed (Mann-Whitney U test) between the possible whales recorded in the satellite images and of real whales recorded in situ by aerial surveys, while considering either the number of groups (p = .841, n = 5) or the total number of animals (p = .222, n = 5). Further, when using VHR images, the geographical positions of the whales recorded in situ had a positive correlation with the positions generated from the satellite images (Mantel test: r = 0.52, p = .001, n = 13). This technique may represent an important tool for detecting right whales, especially in countries where research funding is scarce.

TI  - Glacier Change Studies under Changing Climate Using Geospatial Tools and Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal study of the glaciers under the changing environment is critical from the freshwater availability, especially in the perennial rivers flowing out of them during the lean season. The Mrigthuni Glacier, one of the major glaciers in the Pindar River basin in Uttarakhand, has been selected as a study glacier for the present analysis. The long-term (1951-2018) meteorological data analysis indicated that the temperature increased in both the maximum ablation and accumulation period; however, the precipitation decreased during the primary accumulation period. The change detected in climate patterns provided an impetus to study its impact on the glacier using geospatial techniques. It was found that the glacier front retreated by 831.4 +/- 42 m at the rate of 32.94 m yr(-1) from 1990 to 2015. Further, the glacier accumulation area ratio has reduced from 55.63 to 53.22%, with a 66 m upward shift in equilibrium line altitude (ELA). The glacier's mass balance has reduced from 0.23 to 0.28 +/- 0.035 m w.e. during the analysis period, based on a general equation developed for northwestern Himalaya using the optical remote sensing data. Due to the limitations of optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was used to map glacier radar zones. The distinct percolation/refreeze, transient firn, and ablation zones were identified on the SAR data composite of the different seasons. Considering SAR-based ELA as the most accurate, the analysis confirmed the negative mass balance with a value of 0.62 +/- 0.036 m w.e. Therefore, it was concluded that SAR-based analysis might be vital for accurate glacier dynamics studies especially the mass balance.

TI  - Empirical modeling of chlorophyll a from MODIS satellite imagery for trophic status monitoring of Lake Victoria in East Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We detail our attempts at empirical modeling of MODIS derived Chlorophyll a (Chl a) distribution on Lake Victoria in East Africa and consequently its trophic status. This was motivated by the need for Lake Victoria specific algorithms, as the current satellite based standard algorithms overestimate derived Chl a. In situ Chl a data was hence collected in three field campaigns in November 2014, March 2015 and July 2015. In situ reflectances were collected during the July campaign only. We first developed models from in situ reflectances and in situ Chl a, which when applied to MODIS bands performed dismally (R-2 = 0.03). We then proceeded to derive empirical models by directly comparing MODIS bands with in situ Chl a based on data collected in November 2014 and July 2015. The March 2015 dataset couldn't be used due to cloud cover hence no matchups could be obtained. The best model derived (R-2 = 0.88) was based on the ratio 488 nm/645 nm, and was then used to determine the trophic status of Lake Victoria using Carlson's Chl a Trophic State Index (TSI). The results show that large areas of the lake are mesotrophic with eutrophic displays closer to the shores. The modeled TSI was then validated against in situ TSI derived from the March dataset and posted an 80% matchup. One of the main challenges, however is the prevalence of cloud cover, which hinders synoptic mapping of the lake. That notwithstanding, the study demonstrates the potential of earth observation in providing accurate TSI information for improved management of Lake Victoria.

TI  - Evaluation of the Climate Change Impact on Urban Heat Island Based on Land Surface Temperature and Geospatial Indicators
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Population pressure, infrastructural development, and economic growth are the reasons for increasing urbanization process although urban expansion. Land-use change, vegetation degradation, and also climate change are the results of urban heat island (UHI). Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential aspect of global climate change studies, calculating radiation budgets, heat balance studies, and also estimating the climate change scenario. In this study, investigate the UHI using thermal remote-sensing data. Satellite thermal data are used to calculate the thermal variation in Kolkata metropolitan and surrounding area. The remote-sensing technique is used to detect land use in 2020 using supervised classification, calculation of LST, and variation of mean LST from this region. The maximum and minimum temperatures are 33 degrees C and 18 degrees C individually. This study analyzes the LST distribution correlation with different spectral indicator. The relationship between NDVI and SAVI results shows negative correlation (R-2 0.20 and 0.15, respectively) because of vegetation area effect on urban expansion. The urban heat island shows positive relation between LST and NDBI and UI because of urbanization and industrial development. The R-2 values are show 0.61 and 0.27, respectively. The relationship between MNDWI and NDBal is showing 0.0003 and 0.04 individually. Kolkata metropolitan and surrounding urban areas are increased temperature due to urbanization, climate change and global warming and overuse of public vehicles. The UHI was increased due to anthropological activities. This study helps to identify the recent thermal variation of this area and build a proper management and planning for sustainable urban development.

TI  - In vivo imaging of retrovirus infection reveals a role for Siglec-1/CD169 in multiple routes of transmission
T2  - ELIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early events in retrovirus transmission are determined by interactions between incoming viruses and frontline cells near entry sites. Despite their importance for retroviral pathogenesis, very little is known about these events. We developed a bioluminescence imaging (BLI)-guided multiscale imaging approach to study these events in vivo. Engineered murine leukemia reporter viruses allowed us to monitor individual stages of retrovirus life cycle including virus particle flow, virus entry into cells, infection and spread for retroorbital, subcutaneous, and oral routes. BLI permitted temporal tracking of orally administered retroviruses along the gastrointestinal tract as they traversed the lumen through Peyer's patches to reach the draining mesenteric sac. Importantly, capture and acquisition of lymph-, blood-, and milk-borne retroviruses spanning three routes was promoted by a common host factor, the I-type lectin CD169, expressed on sentinel macrophages. These results highlight how retroviruses co-opt the immune surveillance function of tissue-resident sentinel macrophages for establishing infection.

TI  - Analyzing ecological environment change and associated driving factors in China based on NDVI time series data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment is the foundation of human survival and development. China's ecological environment has undergone a historic transition from partial improvement to overall improvement. In this paper, long time series NDVI data (1998-2018) are used to evaluate the ecological environment change and spatiotemporal change that has taken place in China over the last 20 years, at different scales (regional, provincial, county, and grid scales). Combined with typical areas, the causes of ecological environment change are revealed. The results show that in about one-third of China, the ecological environment improved, and in 10%, the ecological environment deteriorated. Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi are the provinces in which the improvement of the ecological environment is most pronounced. However, the ecological environments with vegetation as the core in Shanghai and Jiangsu Province have deteriorated significantly. The areas with the fastest improvement in their ecological environment are those with precipitation of 200-600 mm. The Yellow River Basin is an area where the ecological environment has significantly improved. Forestry projects and the development of oasis agriculture effectively promote the improvement of the ecological environment. In the past 20 years, the main reason for the degradation of the ecological environment in eastern coastal areas is urban expansion. China should continue to strengthen its overall layout of forestry projects and improve its ecological environment. When planning its ecological construction, China should fully consider the associated physical and geographical conditions, and adjust measures to local conditions accordingly. China should coordinate the relationship between development and protection and avoid the "pie spread" expansion witnessed in eastern coastal areas.

TI  - Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La<SUP>3+</SUP> and Nd<SUP>3+</SUP>) in Molten Salts
T2  - CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high-purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here, the competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La3+ and Nd3+) is explored in molten LiCl-KCl-LiF-LnCl(3) salts using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln(3+) occur when F- concentration increases, indicating that the F- anions interact with Ln(3+) via substituting the coordinated Cl- anions, and confirm [LnCl(x)F(y)](3-x-y) (y(max)=3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts. Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl- and F- anions, which leads to the formation of four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl(6)](3-), [LnCl(5)F](3-), [LnCl(4)F(2)](3-) and [LnCl(4)F(3)](4-). Among them, the seven-coordinated [LnCl(4)F(3)](4-) complex possesses a low-symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, it was concluded that Ln-F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F- ions.

TI  - High resolution aerosol optical depth retrieval over urban areas from Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) provides unique estimation of aerosol loading across a continuous space. However, current AOD products with a relatively coarse resolution (>= 1 km) can hardly capture the details in urban areas with large spatial AOD gradients. To address this issue, here we developed a novel retrieval algorithm for retrieving AOD with extra fine spatial resolution (30 m) from Landsat-8 satellite OLI images. In the algorithm, the three land surface reflectance (LSR) estimation schemes and four aerosol types are adopted to improve the retrieval accuracy. The algorithm is applied on Beijing and Wuhan city in China during 2014-2019. Results suggest that the retrieved AOD with the new algorithm exhibits good agreement with the ground-based measured AOD (R2 = 0.920), and 81.63% of the AODs fall within the expected error line with a root-mean-square error of 0.112. Moreover, the high-resolution AOD products also successfully identified polluted sources and discrepancy of aerosol loading over different land cover types in two megacities in China, implying its great potential on detecting fine aerosol emission sources over the complex urban area. Such improvement of the new algorithm for retrieving 30 m AOD developed in this study demonstrates its substantial potentials in supporting further studies of air pollution management and human exposure at extra-fine spatial scale.

TI  - Effects of Spatial Resolution on Burned Forest Classification With ICESat-2 Photon Counting Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring forest fire activities is critical to understanding carbon dynamics and climate change. Three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure changes caused by fire make it possible to adopt Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) in burned forest classification. This study focuses on the effects of spatial resolution when using LiDAR data to differentiate burned and unburned forests. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission provides LiDAR datasets such as the geolocated photon data (ATL03) and the land vegetation height product (ATL08), which were used in this study. The ATL03 data were filtered by two algorithms: the ATL08 algorithm (ILV) and the adaptive ground and canopy height retrieval algorithm (AGCH), producing classified canopy points and ground points. Six typical spatial resolutions: 10, 30, 60, 100, 200, and 250 m were employed to divide the classified photon points into separate segments along the track. Twenty-six canopy related metrics were derived from each segment. Sentinel-2 images were used to provide reference land cover maps. The Random Forest classification method was employed to classify burned and unburned segments in the temperate forest in California and the boreal forest in Alberta, respectively. Both weak beams and strong beams of ICESat-2 data were included in comparisons. Experiment results show that spatial resolution can significantly influence the canopy structures we detected. Classification accuracies increase along with coarser spatial resolutions and saturate at 100 m segment length, with overall accuracies being 79.43 and 92.13% in the temperate forest and the boreal forest, respectively. Classification accuracies based on strong beams are higher than those of using weak beams due to a larger point density in strong beams. The two filtering algorithms present comparable accuracies in burned forest classification. This study demonstrates that spatial resolution is a critical factor to consider when using spaceborne LiDAR for canopy structure characterization and classification, opening an avenue for improved measurement of forest structures and evaluation of terrestrial vegetation responses to climate change.

TI  - Calibration of the laser pointing bias of the GaoFen-7 satellite based on simulation waveform matching
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The two-beam GaoFen-7 (GF-7) laser altimeter is China's first formal spaceborne laser altimeter system for Earth observations. In this article, a calibration method based on simulation waveform matching is proposed to correct the laser pointing error now that the satellite is in orbit. In the method, the optimal position of the laser footprint is searched using simulated and actual waveforms. Then, the laser pointing is calibrated based on the laser footprint optimal position. In this paper, after calibration of the GF-7 laser pointing, infrared detectors are used to capture laser footprints for accuracy verification. The results show that the GF-7 laser pointing accuracy is greatly improved by the method; the laser pointing accuracy of beam 1 is approximately 5.4 arcsec, and that of beam 2 is approximately 5.7 arcsec. Subsequently, two laser footprints are selected for GF-7 laser calibration in the Helan Mountains, China, and AW3D30 digital surface model (DSM) and GPS/RTK data are used to verify the laser elevation measurement accuracy (EMA). The results show that the EMA of the GF-7 laser is significantly improved after calibration. Over flat terrain, the EMA of the GF-7 laser is improved by 10 times, from 3.74 +/- 0.55 m to 0.35 +/- 0.50 m, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - River Flood Detection Using Passive Microwave Remote Sensing in a Data-Scarce Environment: A Case Study for Two River Basins in Malawi
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and forecasting riverine floods is of paramount importance for adequate disaster risk management and humanitarian response. However, this is challenging in data-scarce and ungauged river basins in developing countries. Satellite remote sensing data offers a cost-effective, low-maintenance alternative to the limited in-situ data when training, parametrizing and operating flood models. Utilizing the signal difference between a measurement (M) and a dry calibration (C) location in Passive Microwave Remote Sensing (PMRS), the resulting r(cm) index simulates river discharge in the measurement pixel. Whilst this has been demonstrated for several river basins, it is as of yet unknown at what ratio of the spatial scales of the river width vs. the PMRS pixel resolution it remains effective in East-Africa. This study investigates whether PMRS imagery at 37 GHz can be effectively used for flood preparedness in two small-scale basins in Malawi, the Shire and North Rukuru river basins. Two indices were studied: The m index (r(cm) expressed as a magnitude relative to the average flow) and a new index that uses an additional wet calibration cell: r ( cmc ). Furthermore, the results of both indices were benchmarked against discharge estimates from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). The results show that the indices have a similar seasonality as the observed discharge. For the Shire River, r ( cmc ) had a stronger correlation with discharge (rho = 0.548) than m (rho = 0.476), and the former predicts discharge more accurately (R (2) = 0.369) than the latter (R (2) = 0.245). In Karonga, the indices performed similarly. The indices do not perform well in detecting individual flood events when comparing the signal to a flood impact database. However, these results are sensitive to the threshold used and the impact database quality. The method presented simulated Shire River discharge and detected floods more accurately than GloFAS. It therefore shows potential for river monitoring in data-scarce areas, especially for rivers of a similar or larger spatial scale than the Shire River. Upstream pixels could not directly be used to forecast floods occurring downstream in these specific basins, as the time lag between discharge peaks did not provide sufficient warning time.

TI  - An enhanced pixel-based phenological feature for accurate paddy rice mapping with Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate paddy rice mapping with remote sensing at a regional scale plays critical roles in agriculture and ecology. Previous studies mainly employed a single key phenological period (i.e., transplanting) for paddy rice mapping. However, the prominent poor spectral separability between paddy rice and others (e.g., wetland vegetation) exists in this period. To this end, we developed an enhanced pixel-based phenological feature composite method (Eppf-CM). Subsequently, the feature derived from Eppf-CM was served as the input data to a one-class classifier (One-Class Support Vector Machine, OCSVM). Eppf-CM includes two steps: (1) four distinctive phenological periods, specifically designed for rice mapping, were identified by time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery. (2) We strived to choose one or two vegetation indices for each phenological period, and then stacking all the indices together. The new developed paddy rice mapping method with Eppf-CM and OCSVM is low costs and high precision. To fully demonstrate the outstanding precision of Eppf-CM based paddy rice map (Eppf map) in this study, three different sources of reference data were employed for comparison purposes. Compared with the field survey data, Eppf map achieved an overall accuracy higher than 0.98. The paddy rice area in Northeast China from Eppf map is only 1.86% less than that of the National Bureau of Statistics in 2019. Compared with a latest paddy rice map at the same spatial resolution (10-m), Eppf map significantly reduced commission and omission errors. To the best of our knowledge, the Eppf-CM has obtained one of the highest accuracy rice maps in Northeast China up-to-date. As a whole, we expect that: (1) Eppf-CM will advance the phenology-based agricultural remote sensing mapping method. (2) The paddy rice map will provide a new baseline data for the study of agriculture and ecology.

TI  - Lake Urmia restoration success story: A natural trend or a planned remedy?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia is the second-largest hypersaline lake in the world. There has been a drastic water level drop of 7.2 m from 1995 to 2016. Beginning in October 2013, the Lake Urmia Restoration Plan (LURP) launched a 10-year program. An increase in water level and a relative improvement in Lake Urmia condition has been observed since 2017. It is an undecided and controversial issue whether the recent positive trend of Lake Urmia has been due to the LURP activities or it is a natural contribution of climate factors variations. To shed some light on this issue, we examine three other lakes, adjacent to the Lake Urmia basin, with similar rainfall variability to investigate their status during the same period. Van (Turkey), Mosul, and Tharthar (both in Iraq), are evaluated as well as Lake Urmia. Three decades of remotely sensed data including precipitation (P), water level (WL), and lake extent (A) were considered for the mentioned lakes. A significant correlation was observed between standardized WL - P, and A - P over the long-term period, especially for the recent three years (R2 = 0.63-0.87). We show that the cumulative precipitation in the antecedent months played a major role in the improvement of these lakes' situation but with different time lags (up to 6 months for Van and Mosul lakes and up to 36 months for Lake Urmia and Tharthar lake). These findings could inform the planners of LURP to adopt strategies for achieving a sustainable state of Lake Urmia based on a more realistic outlook.

TI  - Investigating Remote-Sensing Techniques to Reveal Stealth Coronal Mass Ejections
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Eruptions of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun are usually associated with a number of signatures that can be identified in solar disc imagery. However, there are cases in which a CME that is well observed in coronagraph data is missing a clear low-coronal counterpart. These events have received attention during recent years, mainly as a result of the increased availability of multi-point observations, and are now known as "stealth CMEs." In this work, we analyze examples of stealth CMEs featuring various levels of ambiguity. All the selected case studies produced a large-scale CME detected by coronagraphs and were observed from at least one secondary viewpoint, enabling a priori knowledge of their approximate source region. To each event, we apply several image processing and geometric techniques with the aim to evaluate whether such methods can provide additional information compared to the study of "normal" intensity images. We are able to identify at least weak eruptive signatures for all events upon careful investigation of remote-sensing data, noting that differently processed images may be needed to properly interpret and analyze elusive observations. We also find that the effectiveness of geometric techniques strongly depends on the CME propagation direction with respect to the observers and the relative spacecraft separation. Being able to observe and therefore forecast stealth CMEs is of great importance in the context of space weather, since such events are occasionally the solar counterparts of so-called "problem geomagnetic storms."

TI  - The utility of ICG fluorescence for sentinel lymph node identification in head and neck melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Perform an evidence-based review to determine the utility of indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) to detect sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in patients with head and neck melanoma compared to blue dye or radiocolloid injection (RI). Materials and methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify patients with head and neck melanoma managed with ICG fluorescence. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Included studies were assessed for level of evidence. Patient demographics and data on SLN identification were determined. Results: Twenty-two studies encompassing 399 patients (75% male, 25% female, average age 57.1 years) met inclusion criteria. Publications comprised of two case reports, four retrospective case series, twelve cohort studies, and four clinical trials. Most common site of melanoma was scalp/temple/forehead (35%), cheek/ midface (22%), and ear (17%) with an average Breslow thickness of 3.32 mm. SLN was identified in 80.7% (n = 201/249) of patients using ICG-RI, 85.2% (n = 75/88) using RI alone, and 63.4% (n = 52/82) using blue dye-RI. Conclusions: ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid hybrid tracer may be a superior alternative to blue dye + adiocolloid and has theoretical advantages compared to RI alone. Additional prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to further compare these methods and obtain data on false negative rates, operating room time, and cost effectiveness to fully elucidate the utility of ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid over current methods used for SLN identification in this patient population.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19-induced lockdowns during spring 2020 on nitrogen dioxide levels over major American counties
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 has quickly spread throughout the world, infecting and killing millions of people. In an effort to contain the spread of the virus, many governments implemented stringent lockdown measures. These lockdown restrictions, coupled with social distancing, severely curtailed transportation and industrial activities, which are the primary drivers of nitrogen oxides emissions. This study investigates whether lockdown orders in the United States have impacted tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels by evaluating 12 major counties with a total population of 38 million. For each county, Sentinel-5P satellite data were obtained and analyzed to determine NO2 column concentrations during the pre-lockdown, peak lockdown, and loosening lockdown periods in 2020. Then, NO2 levels were compared during these three periods to the same time frame in 2019. Our results show that the lockdowns in the 12 major U.S. counties analyzed led to a significant decline in NO2 levels, with an average reduction of 28.7% (+/- 14.6%) and 17.6% (+/- 10.9%) during peak lockdown and loosening lockdown periods, respectively.

TI  - Evaluating post-fire recovery of Latroon dry forest using Landsat ETM plus , unmanned aerial vehicle and field survey data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the fire severity and recovery process of the Latroon dry forest in Jordan following the 2003 fire. A series of multi-temporal Landsat-ETM + data and the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) were used to map the fire severity immediately following the fire and 1,5,9,13 and 17 years after. In addition, combined field morphophysiological measurements, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also used in 2020 to assess the forest recovery. Landsat-dNBR images revealed that about 65% of the forest was burned in 2003. In 2020, about 90% of the burned area recovered to condition before fire. UAV means were similar to ground measurement data across the severity classes and over the tested species. Landsat-dNBR images showed that most moderate and highly severe burned area in 2003 had recovered in 2020 but ground measurements showed that the severely burned area trees were significantly shorter (p < 0.001) than those from the moderate severity across the studied species. Therefore, Landsat-dNBR did not detect tree height changes. While UAV can potentially estimate the tree height, Landsat-ETM+ (near-infrared, chlorophyll; shortwave-infrared, water status) hold promise for estimating the physiology of the canopy. Overall, different remote sensing levels are required to track different kinds of changes in the recovered forests.

TI  - RGAN: Rethinking generative adversarial networks for cloud removal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing imagery is at the core of many Earth observation activities. Many applications take use of the satellite data's regular, consistent, and global-scale characteristics, such as farmland monitoring, climate change assessment, land-cover, and land-use categorization, and catastrophe assessment. Optical remote sensing images, on the other hand, are frequently impacted by clouds during the collection process, resulting in reduced image clarity, which impairs feature assessment and future usage, and heavy cloud blockage renders the surface information below totally useless. In this paper, We propose a soft attention recurrent neural module based on an encoder-decoder network, which can solve the cloud occlusion problem. We also propose an adaptive padding convolution at the end of the decoder by taking into account the spatial information, which results in better declouding predictions, and our network achieves good results on the RICE1 and RICE2 data sets.

TI  - Optimal foraging by a large ungulate in an extreme environment: Wild mountain reindeer select snow-free feeding habitats in winter
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimal foraging models predict that individual animals will optimize net energy gain by intensifying forage activity and/or reducing forage energy cost. Then, the free distribution model predicts an animal's distribution in a patchy landscape will match the distribution of the resources. If not modified by other factors, such patterns may be expected to be particularly explicit in variable and extreme, forage-limited, and patchy environments, notably alpine and Arctic environments during winter. The large ungulate wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) surviving in such environments is used as a model during the forage-limited winter season. The largest wild reindeer area in Western Europe (Hardangervidda, 8130 km(2)) is actively managed to sustain 10,000-12,000 wild reindeer. Since 2001, 104 different individuals have been GPS-tracked at 3-hr intervals. In winter, mountain reindeer may either choose to seek out and forage in patchy snow-free habitats, typically on top of wind-blown ridges, or use energy-demanding digging through the snow to reach ground forage (cratering). We use late April satellite data from Landsat 5 and 8 (30 x 30 m), airborne laser scanning subsampling (processed to 1 x 1 m grid), and topographic information (1 m resolution) derived from digital aerial photographs (0.25 x 0.25 m resolution) to delineate snow-free patches, constituting less than 694 km(2). By overlaying recorded wild reindeer GPS positions winters 2001-2017 (188,942 positions), we document a strong positive selection for snow-free patches, which were used about four times more frequently than expected from a "random walk" model. On a daily basis, the preference for snow-free areas was slightly stronger in the evenings. In the sustainable management of wild mountain reindeer, the area of snow-free patches is an important predictor of winter forage availability and important winter source areas. It may be derived from remote sensing data.

TI  - Utility of texture combinations computed from fused WorldView-2 imagery in discriminating commercial forest species
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Commercial forest species discrimination is valuable for optimal management of commercial forests. Therefore, second-order image texture combinations computed from a 0.5 m WorldView-2 pan-sharpened image integrated with sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPLS-DA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to discriminate commercial forest species. The findings show that the SPLS-DA model, which is characterised by concurrent variable selection and reduction of data dimensionality, produced an overall classification accuracy of 86%, with an allocation disagreement of 9 and a quantity disagreement of 5. Conversely, the PLS-DA model with variable importance in projection (VIP) produced an overall classification accuracy of 81%, with an allocation disagreement of 12 and a quantity disagreement of 7. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of second-order image texture combinations in discriminating commercial forest species and presents an opportunity for improved commercial forest species delineation.

TI  - Estimation of ground-level particulate matter concentrations based on synergistic use of MODIS, MERRA-2 and AERONET AODs over a coastal site in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are widely used to estimate the spatial and temporal characteristics of ground-level particulate matters (PM). Satellite-based approaches in the operational use of PM estimation models have limitations such as missing values in satellite-based variables due to the impact of cloud cover, relative humidity, and aerosol vertical distribution. Therefore, the spatial-temporal resolution of the estimation models is forced to be improved by using AOD products having different temporal resolutions from different platforms. In this study, ground-based PM10 concentrations were aimed to be estimated using different gap-filled AOD datasets between 2008 and 2016 over a coastal site in the Eastern Mediterranean. For the estimation of PM10 concentrations, daily AOD data were mainly used from MODIS. Then, two different gap-filled MODIS AOD datasets with both AERONET and MERRA-2 AODs were also examined separately on both multiannual and multi-seasonal basis since the number of MODIS AOD data was temporally limited in the region. A pattern recognition neural network (PRNN) model was used for the estimation of PM10 concentrations. AOD with several meteorological parameters from an on-site meteorological station and aerosol diagnostic products from MERRA-2 were used as inputs to the estimation model. The most significant variables for the model were identified in 23 independent variables using the multiple linear regression (MLR). The results indicated that the best estimation (R = 0.74) was obtained with the gap-filled AODMODIS+MERRA dataset for the period covering all years whereas the AODMODIS dataset alone showed the poorest performance (R = 0.62). However, the performance of the gap-filled datasets varied with the seasons. For example, the AODMODIS dataset alone showed the best estimation performance (R = 0.67) in the summer whereas the gap-filled AODMODIS+AERONET dataset had the best performance (R = 0.59) in the winter. Overall results suggest that for estimating ground-level PM con-centrations, an approach of gap-filled AOD dataset usage for estimation models is useful especially in rainy seasons such as the winter and autumn where MODIS AOD retrievals are limited.

TI  - Post-tsunami land degradation on a South Asian island: Implications for conservation priorities
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, land degradation has accelerated due to an increase in unsustainable human activities. In a case-study of the Andaman Islands, located in the South Asian region, changes in land degradation types, soil erosion, and the effect of conservation measures for pre- (2000) and post-2004 tsunami periods (2006, 2019) were recorded using temporal remote sensing data (LANDSAT, RESOURCESAT, CARTOSAT), field observations and a GIS-based revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The results showed that erosion, leaching, acidification, salinization, and drainage congestion were the major land degradation processes that could be traced to post-tsunami human activities (R-2 = 0.634). The study revealed significant forest cover loss during 2006-2019 (3.76%) compared to 2000-2006 (0.61%), while it revealed increased areas under settlement (14 km(2)) and mining (22 km(2)). The annual crop area exhibited a 0.42% loss, whereas the plantation crop area increased by 0.46%, indicating the abandonment of annual crops that resulted in an increased fallow area (21 km(2)) during the post-tsunami period. As a consequence, degraded land increased by 2.5% of the total geographical area which was affaected by water erosion (2.3%) and chemical degradation (0.25%). The average erosion rate varied from 0.7 to 108 t ha(-1)yr(-1) in 2000 but increased by 47% during the post-tsunami period due to mining, settlement, and vegetable cultivation on slopes, as indicated by high cover management, support practice, and slope length factors. Practicing suitable conservation measures can provide a conservation benefit of 105,560 t yr(-1) and a reduction in other forms of degradation without compromising the food production area.

TI  - Rainfall-Linked Megafires as Innate Fire Regime Elements in Arid Australian Spinifex (<i>Triodia</i> spp.) Grasslands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large, high-severity wildfires, or "megafires," occur periodically in arid Australian spinifex (Triodia spp.) grasslands after high rainfall periods that trigger fuel accumulation. Proponents of the patch-burn mosaic (PBM) hypothesis suggest that these fires are unprecedented in the modern era and were formerly constrained by Aboriginal patch burning that kept landscape fuel levels low. This assumption deserves scrutiny, as evidence from fire-prone systems globally indicates that weather factors are the primary determinant behind megafire incidence, and that fuel management does not mitigate such fires during periods of climatic extreme. We reviewed explorer's diaries, anthropologist's reports, and remotely sensed data from the Australian Western Desert for evidence of large rainfall-linked fires during the pre-contact period when traditional Aboriginal patch burning was still being practiced. We used only observations that contained empiric estimates of fire sizes. Concurrently, we employed remote rainfall data and the Oceanic Nino Index to relate fire size to likely seasonal conditions at the time the observations were made. Numerous records were found of small fires during periods of average and below-average rainfall conditions, but no evidence of large-scale fires during these times. By contrast, there was strong evidence of large-scale wildfires during a high-rainfall period in the early 1870s, some of which are estimated to have burnt areas up to 700,000 ha. Our literature review also identified several Western Desert Aboriginal mythologies that refer to large-scale conflagrations. As oral traditions sometimes corroborate historic events, these myths may add further evidence that large fires are an inherent feature of spinifex grassland fire regimes. Overall, the results suggest that, contrary to predictions of the PBM hypothesis, traditional Aboriginal burning did not modulate spinifex fire size during periods of extreme-high arid zone rainfall. The mechanism behind this is that plant assemblages in seral spinifex vegetation comprise highly flammable non-spinifex tussock grasses that rapidly accumulate high fuel loads under favorable precipitation conditions. Our finding that fuel management does not prevent megafires under extreme conditions in arid Australia has parallels with the primacy of climatic factors as drivers of megafires in the forests of temperate Australia.

TI  - CALIOP retrieval of droplet effective radius accounting for cloud vertical homogeneity
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring cloud droplet effective radius (re) is of great significance for studying aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Passive satellite retrieval, e.g., MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), requires sunlight. This requirement prompted developing re retrieval using active sensors, e.g., CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization). Given the highest sensitivity of vertically homogeneous clouds to aerosols that feed to cloud base, here CALIOP profile measurements were used for the first time to quantify cloud vertical homogeneity and estimate cloud re during both day and night. Comparison using simultaneous Aqua-MODIS measurements demonstrates that CALIOP retrieval has the highest accuracy for vertically homogeneous clouds, with R-2 (MAE, RMSE) of 0.72 (1.75 mu m, 2.25 mu m), while the accuracy is lowest for non-homogeneous clouds, with R-2 (MAE, RMSE) of 0.60 (2.90 mu m, 3.70 mu m). The improved re retrieval in vertically homogeneous clouds provides a basis for possible breakthrough insights in ACI by CALIOP since re in such clouds reflects most directly aerosol effects on cloud properties. Global day-night maps of cloud vertical homogeneity and respective re are presented. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Simultaneous primary invasive breast carcinoma and ipsilateral cutaneous melanoma of the back: Surgical approach and considerations, a case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: A patient presented with ipsilateral, synchronous primary malignancies of left upper back melanoma and left breast invasive ductal carcinoma. This complex presentation was managed with a multidisciplinary approach.Case presentation: A 61-year-old female presented with multiple cutaneous lesions, revealed to be several foci of melanoma in situ as well as a T4b melanoma of the left upper back. On staging work up, a left breast malignancy was incidentally discovered. Genetic testing did not delineate a relevant mutation to explain the synchronous malignancies. Multidisciplinary surgical planning entailed consideration of the lymphatic drainage patterns of the lesions, with both the upper back melanoma and breast carcinoma expected to drain to the left axilla. Ultimately, simultaneous resections of both malignancies were performed as well as concomitant left sentinel lymph node biopsies utilizing dual tracer technique.Clinical discussion: Currently, cases of synchronous primary cutaneous melanoma and independent, ipsilateral primary breast carcinoma have not been examined, and thus surgical considerations for axillary staging in this circumstance have not been discussed. The existing literature instead explores the incidence and operative challenges of one malignancy following the other after an interval of time.Conclusion: This case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary team for complex oncologic presentations and discusses a creative surgical approach to address two simultaneous primary malignancies involving the left breast and ipsilateral skin of the back. This case emphasizes an exceedingly rare presentation and serves as an important example to educate medical professionals on the innovative and team-based approach to treatment.

TI  - Is proline the quintessential sentinel of plants? A case study of postharvest flower senescence in <i>Dianthus chinensis</i> L.
T2  - PHYSIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation primarily focussed on evaluating the efficacy of exogenous proline on the flower longevity of Dianthus chinensis L. Floral buds were harvested at the paint brush stage (i.e., a day prior to anthesis) and divided into 6 sets, with one set of buds (i.e., control) held in distilled water and rest of the 5 sets were supplemented with various concentrations of proline, viz., 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM, 40 mM and 50 mM. The application of proline at 40 mM concentration proved out to be most effective in improving the longevity of the flowers by about 4 days as compared to the control. The ameliorated longevity coincided with enhanced floral diameter, fresh mass, dry mass and water content. The flowers with delayed senescence also maintained higher soluble proteins, sugars and phenols. The results suggest that exogenous proline effectively alleviates oxidative stress in the petal tissue, as evident by a relatively lower maloendialdehyde content, which is manifested in the form of reduced lipid peroxidation (LPO). Reduced LPO was commensurate with increased membrane stability, quantified by membrane stability index. Moreover, the flowers with improved longevity exhibited a decline in lipoxygenase activity and significant augmentation of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase.

TI  - Linking ocean colour features in the Western Iberian margin to wave-induced sediment resuspension and coccolithophore patches
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Two ocean colour features in the western Iberian margin (western Europe) were described in present work. They were identified in 10 years (2002-2012) of MODIS-AQUA normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) at 555 nm and their causes were investigated using complementary satellite, in-situ and model data. One feature was a band of high nLw555 (>0.8 mW cm-2 mu m- 1 sr- 1) with exceptionally large widths (>20 km) along the coast. Over the 10-year period, this wide coastal band of high nLw555 only occurred during winter, following better the increases in wave height, than the increases in precipitation and river discharge. The band seemed particularly associated with episodes of large wave heights (>6 m), under weak thermal stratification and northerly winds. Findings suggest that the band is the signature of exceptional offshore extensions of the more reflective turbid coastal waters, as a result of wave-induced sediment resuspension along the coast. The other feature consisted in areas of equally high nLw555, but separated from the coast by more than 40 km. These offshore areas of high nLw555 shared spectral signatures of phytoplankton, namely coccolithophores, typically formed during spring following water column re-stratification and reached larger areas after winters with deeper oceanic mixed layers. Less commonly, they also occurred from summer to autumn. Results indicate they are mainly the signature of enhanced coccolithophore abundances that also create turbid reflective waters due to their calcite plates. The used methodology separated the two features in time and therefore seems to allow for satellite monitoring of sediment resuspension and coccolithophore blooms off west Iberia and similar coastal environments, which is particularly relevant for detecting events of sediment transport, potentially linked to water quality problems, and long-term changes in phytoplankton composition.

TI  - Developing a Water Quality Assessment Framework for Southwest Florida Tidal Creeks
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The three contiguous National Estuary Programs of southwest Florida, along with partners from six coastal counties, have developed a tidal creek water quality assessment framework to help prioritize natural resource investigations across a large population of tidal creeks between Tampa Bay and Estero Bay, Florida. The assessment framework is based on outcomes of a multidisciplinary study and includes a nutrient based report card that characterizes nutrient conditions relative to regional numeric nutrient criteria developed for contributing freshwater streams, identification of site-specific water quality indicators of tidal creek condition, and an online open science dashboard to display the assessment framework and provide access to all information relevant to its implementation. Application of the assessment framework has provided an actionable list of southwest Florida tidal creeks prioritized for further research and potential management action along with a host of site-specific indicator results that provide insights into drivers of tidal creek condition. The open science dashboard provides a platform for dissemination of this information in a readily accessible and reproducible format and a means to incorporate new data and indicators as they become available. Local resource managers are in need of tools to help prioritize natural resource investigations and management actions that achieve the greatest resource benefit with limited available resources. This assessment framework informs these efforts and builds capacity for future research to identify and refine management tools for these creeks where management resources, data, and sentinel biological response endpoints are limited.

TI  - Religious Certainty as Social Capital
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recent scholarship on the social embeddedness of religion indicate that religious choices are often best explained through social ties, and religious belief and practice is influenced by congregational embeddedness. Berger's theory of secularization argued that plausibility structures were maintained by interactions with others with the same worldview, and that outgroup ties can reduce one's certainty in religion and be detrimental to the religious group. Taken together these approaches suggest that religious certainty functions like Coleman's conceptualization of social capital. Purpose The purpose of this present study is to begin to conceptualize religious certainty as a form of social capital: something that inheres in social relationships and serves as a resource for future religious action of the individual; as well as potentially serving a resource for congregations. Methods Using the Baylor Religion Study 2005 data I operationalize religious certainty as the certainty in the belief of the existence of God, and then perform logistic regression on certainty in God's existence using social ties variables. Then I operationalize religious participation as attendance and run a multiple regression on attendance using certainty in the belief of God as an independent variable. Results The findings from the logistic regression on certainty indicate support for the hypotheses concerning social ties and certainty. The study finds that family religiosity and the number of friends one has who attend the same congregation the higher odds of certainty; whereas and the number of non-religious friends one has decreases the odds of certainty in the existence of God. The multiple regression on attendance suggests that religious certainty, net of all other variables, has a strong positive influence on attendance. Conclusions and Implications The results offer preliminary support for the argument: religious certainty does in fact appear to be a form of social capital since it inheres in social relationships and serves as a resource for individual action. This has important implications for congregations as those with higher stocks of social capital will have greater resources for religious action. It also offers some empirical support for the microfoundations of Berger's theory of secularization.

TI  - Responses of soil erosion to land-use changes in the largest tableland of the Loess Plateau
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a global environmental problem, and land-use changes have significantly altered soil erosion processes. However, soil erosion processes and their major influencing factors vary among different landforms. Dongzhiyuan (DZY), that is, the largest tableland in the Loess Plateau (LP), has experienced significant land-use changes in previous decades. However, little is known about impacts of land-use changes on soil erosion across different landforms in the DZY tableland. LANDSAT images from 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017 were used to extract information on the land-use changes in DZY. The decreases of farmland amount to 2.57 x 10(4) ha from 1987 to 1997, forest by 1.30 x 10(4) ha from 1997 to 2007, and grassland by 2.74 x 10(4) ha from 2007 to 2017. Urban areas increased by 1.41 x 10(4) ha from 1987 to 2017. The soil erosion estimated by the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and Chinese soil loss equation (CSLE) was 11.3 and 5.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The conversion from urban areas to farmland and grassland increased soil erosion. Changes from farmland to grassland and forest to grassland, intensified soil erosion; the severity of soil erosion depended on the intensity of the land-use changes. Urban expansion caused a smaller decrease in soil erosion in the loess tableland, whereas vegetation restoration, to a large extent, decreased soil erosion in the loess gully area. Anthropogenic activity accelerated soil erosion before 1997, but slowed its influence after 1997. This study provides a reference for land-use planning and soil water conservation in the LP.

TI  - SAT-CEP-monitor: An air quality monitoring software architecture combining complex event processing with satellite remote sensing
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a major problem today that causes serious damage to human health. Urban areas are the most affected by the degradation of air quality caused by anthropogenic gas emissions. Although there are multiple proposals for air quality monitoring, in most cases, two limitations are imposed: the impossibility of processing data in Near Real-Time (NRT) for remote sensing approaches and the impossibility of reaching areas of limited accessibility or low network coverage for ground data approaches. We propose a software architecture that efficiently combines complex event processing with remote sensing data from various satellite sensors to monitor air quality in NRT, giving support to decision-makers. We illustrate the proposed solution by calculating the air quality levels for several areas of Morocco and Spain, extracting and processing satellite information in NRT. This study also validates the air quality measured by ground stations and satellite sensor data.

TI  - When is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Useful in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ? The Experience at a Latin American Cancer Center
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 15% of breast cancers. Surgery is the main treatment, and the use of sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) is restricted to patients at risk of infiltration, which is estimated to be around 26%.Materials and methodsAimed at evaluating the benefit of SLNB in patients with DCIS at the Breast and Soft Tissue Functional Unit of the National Cancer Institute (INC for its initials in Spanish), a descriptive observational study of a retrospective cases series was conducted between August 1, 2013, and September 30, 2018.ResultsA total of 40 patients with a median age of 57 years were included in the study; 62.5% of them underwent mastectomy with SLNB, and the remaining 37.5% underwent conservative surgery with SLNB. 100% of sentinel nodes were identified, by using lymphoscintigraphy in 95%. Sentinel node was positive in four patients (10%), three of whom had infiltration in the surgical specimen reported. With a follow-up of 49 months, only one patient had a local relapse. None of the patients had axillary or distant recurrence.ConclusionsSLNB in DCIS should be limited to patients with risk factors for infiltration (tumor size greater than 3 cm, comedo- type histology, and high-grade DCIS), and patients with an indication for mastectomy. Its percentage of complications is low, and a high identification percentage in surgical groups with adequate training.

TI  - Characterisation of ammonia emissions from gasoline and gasoline hybrid passenger cars
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent evidence suggests NH3 emissions from road vehicles play an important role in the formation of fine particulate matter, especially in urban areas. However, there is little data available for NH3 emitted from road vehicles under real driving conditions, in part due to its lack of regulation in vehicle emission legislation. In this study, we use 210,000 vehicle emission remote sensing measurements to evaluate the complex mix of factors affecting NH3 emissions from gasoline and gasoline hybrid passenger cars. The influence of vehicle model year and manufacturer on NH3 emissions is considered, as well as the effect of vehicle deterioration. It is found that the amount of NH3 emitted increases as vehicle mileage increases. A comparison of cold start and hot exhaust NH3 emissions reveals that on average, cold start emissions are a factor of 1.7 times higher. New NH3 emission factors are developed, in addition to speed-emission curves that are potentially useful for national inventories. A new application of remote sensing data is reported, whereby the proportion of failed CO2 measurements for hybrid vehicles provides unique insight into the real world battery use of both conventional hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which is used to refine the NH3 emission factors for these vehicles.

TI  - Modeling land use change and forest carbon stock changes in temperate forests in the United States
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Forests provide the largest terrestrial sink of carbon (C). However, these C stocks are threatened by forest land conversion. Land use change has global impacts and is a critical component when studying C fluxes, but it is not always fully considered in C accounting despite being a major contributor to emissions. An urgent need exists among decision-makers to identify the likelihood of forest conversion to other land uses and factors affecting C loss. To help address this issue, we conducted our research in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. The objectives were to (1) model the probability of forest conversion and C stocks dynamics using USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data and (2) create wall-to-wall maps showing estimates of the risk of areas to convert from forest to non-forest. We used two modeling approaches: a machine learning algorithm (random forest) and generalized mixed-effects models. Explanatory variables for the models included ecological attributes, topography, census data, forest disturbances, and forest conditions. Model predictions and Landsat spectral information were used to produce wall-to-wall probability maps of forest change using Google Earth Engine. Results During the study period (2000-2017), 3.4% of the analyzed FIA plots transitioned from forest to mixed or non-forested conditions. Results indicate that the change in land use from forests is more likely with increasing human population and housing growth rates. Furthermore, non-public forests showed a higher probability of forest change compared to public forests. Areas closer to cities and coastal areas showed a higher risk of transition to non-forests. Out of the six states analyzed, Colorado had the highest risk of conversion and the largest amount of aboveground C lost. Natural forest disturbances were not a major predictor of land use change. Conclusions Land use change is accelerating globally, causing a large increase in C emissions. Our results will help policy-makers prioritize forest management activities and land use planning by providing a quantitative framework that can enhance forest health and productivity. This work will also inform climate change mitigation strategies by understanding the role that land use change plays in C emissions.

TI  - Impact of Histological Type and Grade on the Diagnostic Accuracy of Intraoperative Frozen Section for Detecting Breast Cancer Metastasis to Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIntraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation is the standard of care in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. The most common histological subtype of breast carcinoma is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), followed by invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Alternatively, histological grades vary from grades G1 to G3. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of frozen section (FS) for detecting breast cancer metastasis to SLNs with respect to histological subtypes and grades.MethodsA retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Histopathology at Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Pakistan, from January 2013 till December 2020, over a duration of eight years. A total of 540 cases of primary breast cancer, undergoing upfront breast surgery were included in the study. Intraoperatively, SLNs were identified and sent for FS. After FS reporting, the remaining tissue was submitted for final (paraffin) section examination after formalin fixation, and results of FS and final (paraffin) sections were compared.ResultsThe mean age of the patients included in the study was 52.05 +/- 12.42 years, and the median number of SLNs was three (ranging from one to 14). The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative FS were 88.2%, 100%, 100%, 92.5%, and 95.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of FS for IDC was 88.3%, whereas it was 85.7% for ILC. Alternatively, the sensitivity of FS for grade G1, G2, and G3 tumors was 78.3%, 91.5%, and 90.2%, respectively. The false-negative rate for grade G1 tumors was 21.7%, which was higher than G2 and G3 tumors (8.5% and 9.8%, respectively). Similarly, the false-negative rate for cases where the number of SLNs was more than three was only 5.4%, which was lower than cases with a single and two to three SLNs sent on FS (23.1 and 14.7%, respectively).ConclusionThe sensitivity of intraoperative FS for detecting ILC metastasis to axillary SLNs was not substantially different from IDC; however, histological grade affects the sensitivity of FS diagnosis, with lower-grade tumors having low sensitivity. Moreover, increasing the number of SLNs sent intraoperatively on FS improves the sensitivity of FS for detecting breast cancer metastasis to axillary SLNs.

TI  - Pre- and within-season crop type classification trained with archival land cover information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type maps were created without the traditional need for in-season training data across the Corn Belt and Great Plains regions of the United States. This was accomplished through machine learning of historical land cover information, paired with a time-series of multi-spectral satellite imagery composites spanning the growing season, to develop rulesets, which were used for real-time prediction in the current year. Specifically, a decade's worth of annual 30 m resolution crop specific maps, known as the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), provided the foundation, and prior and current year's satellite imagery from Landsat 7 and 8 and Sentinel-2a and-2b built upon it. Four modeling scenarios, all using random forests, were performed to understand the crop mapping abilities of the datasets independently and combined. They were 1) use of CDLs only (i.e. prediction based solely on crop rotation history) 2) use of Landsat 7 and 8 bottom-of-atmosphere surface reflectance imagery only, 3) use of Sentinel-2a and-2b top-of-atmosphere imagery only, and 4) integration of the CDL, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 information together in a unified effort. Furthermore, the model runs were generated monthly, beginning in April, through the growing season to provide understanding of classification performance as a function of time. The 2020 crop year, relatively normal in terms of planting and weather, was used for the test. Accuracy statistics were generated by randomly sampling 50 counties and comparing those classification outputs to the actual 2020 CDL. Pixel-level results showed that prediction by midsummer using only the CDL information provided a crop type map with corn and soybean consumer and producer agreement above 70% and winter wheat just below 50%. The early season imagery-based classifications were markedly worse. However, as Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery accumulated through July, those classifications became significantly better than those reliant on the use of the CDL information only. Ultimately, the very best crop maps resulted from integrating the CDLs with a full season's worth of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. At that point in late September, the corn and soybean agreements were around 85% and winter wheat near 70%. All analysis was performed within Google Earth Engine cloud-based public imagery repository and high-performance computing system. The classification outputs provide practitioners with US crop type maps in near real-time.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data, whether for change detection, spatial and temporal analysis, or numerical simulation of water bodies, requires a complete data set. Here, high temporal and spatial resolution sea surface temperature (SST) data for the Arctic are produced based on optimal interpolation and data reconstruction algorithms with a temporal resolution of 12 h and a spatial resolution of 9 km. The accuracy of the reconstructed data sets is verified using Argo measurements to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the data interpolation empirical orthogonal functions method. The root mean square error of the fusion data (a temporal resolution of 12 h) is relatively stable, ranging from 0.49 degrees C to 0.62 degrees C. In comparison with remote sensing systems (RSS) MW-IR SST and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) OISST, the accuracy of the fusion data (a temporal resolution of 24 h) is in the range of 0.48-0.65 degrees C, while that of the MW-IR SST is in the range of 0.48-0.60 degrees C and AVHRR OISST is in the range of 0.66-0.79 degrees C. The fusion data is more accurate than those of AVHRR OISST, and there is no obvious difference with RSS MW-IR SST.

TI  - Snow covered with dust after Chamoli rockslide: inference based on high-resolution satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-resolution multi-temporal PlanetScope image of 7 February 2021 clearly shows the fall of a large part of the Nanda Ghunti glacier (Uttarakhand) down in the base of the valley from a height of about 2000 m. The recorded seismic signals at the local seismic networks, close to the Joshimath station, show the occurrence of the fall of the first glacier block followed by another block which corresponds to the seismic signal recorded the second time. The timings of signals recorded from the seismic station are related to the visual sign of local dust in the valley after the fall of the glacier blocks at 05:01 AM and 05:28 AM UTC on 7 February 2021. In the present paper, we carried out the changes in spectral signatures of PlanetScope imageries and backscattering coefficients from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at six different locations. Our analysis suggests pronounced changes at all locations based on spectral signatures and backscattering coefficients due to deposition of snow dust due to the fall of the glacier blocks. Changes in surface wetness are evident after the melting of snow due to the deposition of dust in the valley.

TI  - Investigating the drivers of the unprecedented Chernobyl Power Plant Wildfire in April 2020 and its effects on <SUP>137</SUP>Cs dispersal
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we explore the conditions that led to the unprecedented wildfire that occurred in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in April 2020 and the effect of this fire on Cs-137 dispersal, as wildfires are important drivers of Cs-137 resuspension, with potentially harmful consequences for the receiving ecosystems. We characterised the historical wildfire record between 2000 and 2020 using the MCD64A1.006 MODIS Burned Area Monthly Global 500 m dataset and assessed the climatic conditions associated with these wildfire events using ERA5-Land reanalysis data. We also examined fire danger indices at the time of these wildfires. We then explored the widespread effects of the April 2020 wildfire on Cs-137 resuspension and subsequent deposition using the NOAA-HYSPLIT model, concluding that the impacts of such resuspension on areas further afield were minimal. Results show that climatic conditions leading to severe wildfires are increasing, especially during March and April. High soil moisture, relative humidity and extreme temperature anomalies are associated with the largest wildfires on record, and fire risk indices at the time of the April 2020 fire were higher than for other large fires on record. We have estimated that 3854 GBq of Cs-137 resuspended during the CPPF, with atmospheric transport dominant over Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Kazakhstan. The observed increase in large wildfires will have implications for wildfire-driven soil erosion processes, which will further exacerbate the effects of atmospheric-driven Cs-137 redistribution.

TI  - A multi-analysis approach for estimating regional health impacts from the 2017 Northern California wildfires
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke impacts from large wildfires are mounting, and the projection is for more such events in the future as the one experienced October 2017 in Northern California, and subsequently in 2018 and 2020. Further, the evidence is growing about the health impacts from these events which are also difficult to simulate. Therefore, we simulated air quality conditions using a suite of remotely-sensed data, surface observational data, chemical transport modeling with WRF-CMAQ, one data fusion, and three machine learning methods to arrive at datasets useful to air quality and health impact analyses. To demonstrate these analyses, we estimated the health impacts from smoke impacts during wildfires in October 8-20, 2017, in Northern California, when over 7 million people were exposed to Unhealthy to Very Unhealthy air quality conditions. We investigated using the 5-min available GOES-16 fire detection data to simulate timing of fire activity to allocate emissions hourly for the WRF-CMAQ system. Interestingly, this approach did not necessarily improve overall results, however it was key to simulating the initial 12-hr explosive fire activity and smoke impacts. To improve these results, we applied one data fusion and three machine learning algorithms. We also had a unique opportunity to evaluate results with temporary monitors deployed specifically for wildfires, and performance was markedly different. For example, at the permanent monitoring locations, the WRF-CMAQ simulations had a Pearson correlation of 0.65, and the data fusion approach improved this (Pearson correlation = 0.95), while at the temporary monitor locations across all cases, the best Pearson correlation was 0.5. Overall, WRF-CMAQ simulations were biased high and the geostatistical methods were biased low. Finally, we applied the optimized PM2.5 exposure estimate in an exposure-response function. Estimated mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 83 (95% CI: 0, 196) with 47% attributable to wildland fire smoke. Implications: Large wildfires in the United States and in particular California are becoming increasingly common. Associated with these large wildfires are air quality and health impact to millions of people from the smoke. We simulated air quality conditions using a suite of remotely-sensed data, surface observational data, chemical transport modeling, one data fusion, and three machine learning methods to arrive at datasets useful to air quality and health impact analyses from the October 2017 Northern California wildfires. Temporary monitors deployed for the wildfires provided an important model evaluation dataset. Total estimated regional mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 83 (95% confidence interval: 0, 196) with 47% of these deaths attributable to the wildland fire smoke. This illustrates the profound effect that even a 12-day exposure to wildland fire smoke can have on human health.

TI  - Understanding agricultural fire dynamics in the southern Yucatan Peninsular Region using the MODIS (C6) active fire product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smallholder farmers commonly use fire for land clearing and agricultural maintenance in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The southern Yucatan Peninsular Region (SYPR) has experienced increasing fire frequency since the 1960s due to expanding smallholder agriculture and recurrent droughts. Beginning in January 2019, a government-subsidized programme named Sembrando Vida encouraged further smallholder agricultural development throughout Mexico, resulting in increased burning for cropland preparation. This study uses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 1 km Active Fire product to characterize agricultural burning trends in the SYPR between 2010 and 2019, focusing on the impacts of the Sembrando Vida programme. Comparison of MODIS Active Fire locations to visible agricultural burns in coincident Landsat imagery showed a 29.5% (21/71) agreement. MODIS Active Fire time series data exhibited a biennial trend in fire frequency that was caused by interannual rainfall variability. An inverse relationship was found between total rainfall in the burning season and annual fire frequency. A combination of low rainfall and the implementation of Sembrando Vida in 2019 caused a 98% increase in state-authorized burn permitting compared to the 2015-2018 average, and MODIS Active Fire data exhibited a 33% increase in agricultural burns in 2019 compared to previous years that had >1000 fires.

TI  - Spatial resolution enhancement method for Landsat imagery using a Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat and Sentinel-2 are two freely accessible satellite data that are relevant for global land cover monitoring. However, the uses of the latter data set are growing because of its higher spatial resolutions and the availability of benchmark data sets for deep learning applications. In this study, we integrate a style transfer (perceptual loss estimation from Sentinel 2 benchmark data) into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to construct a single image super-resolution model. The proposed model upscales Landsat 8 images (using red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands at 30 m and Panchromatic band 15 m for high-resolution features exploiting) to 10 m (with Sentinel-2 as reference). Compared to pan-sharpening and other upscaling methods, the proposed method can produce more realistic, spatial convincing images at 10 m resolution and more similar to Sentinel-2 images than the other commonly used super-resolution imaging algorithms. As a result, the proposed method extends the usage of high-resolution benchmark data sets for lower resolution imagery to enrich supplement data sources for land cover classification.

TI  - Intake design for an Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion System (ABEP)
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Challenging space missions include those at very low altitudes, where the atmosphere is source of aerodynamic drag on the spacecraft. To extend the lifetime of such missions, an efficient propulsion system is required. One solution is Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) that collects atmospheric particles to be used as propellant for an electric thruster. The system would minimize the requirement of limited propellant availability and can also be applied to any planetary body with atmosphere, enabling new missions at low altitude ranges for longer times. IRS is developing, within the H2020 DISCOVERER project, an intake and a thruster for an ABEP system. The article describes the design and simulation of the intake, optimized to feed the radio frequency (RF) Helicon-based plasma thruster developed at IRS. The article deals in particular with the design of intakes based on diffuse and specular reflecting materials, which are analysed by the PICLas DSMC-PIC tool. Orbital altitudes h = 150-250km and the respective species based on the NRLMSISE-00 model (O, N-2, O-2, He, Ar, H, N) are investigated for several concepts based on fully diffuse and specular scattering, including hybrid designs. The major focus has been on the intake efficiency defined as eta(c) = (N) over dot(out)/(N) over dot(in) with (N) over dot(in) the incoming particle flux, and (N) over dot(out) the one collected by the intake. Finally, two concepts are selected and presented providing the best expected performance for the operation with the selected thruster. The first one is based on fully diffuse accommodation yielding to eta(c) < 0.46 and the second one based on fully specular accommodation yielding to eta(c) < 0.94. Finally, also the influence of misalignment with the flow is analysed, highlighting a strong dependence of eta(c) in the diffuse-based intake while, for the specular-based intake, this is much lower finally leading to a more resilient design while also relaxing requirements of pointing accuracy for the spacecraft.

TI  - Basin-scale and seasonal evaluation of automated threshold methods for surface water detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating surface water using satellite data can improve estimates and predictions for hydroelectric energy generation. The goal of this research is to identify the best threshold method and image band combination to detect seasonal surface water at the basin scale. This paper explores Otsu, Minimum Entropy, and average of Otsu-Minimum Entropy threshold algorithms using Sentinel-2 narrow near-infrared band 8A (N-NIR), shortwave infrared bands 11 and 12 (SWIR-11 or SWIR-12) images for the Assiniboine River Basin (ARB). The highest precision (0.87) of surface water detection was obtained in autumn using Minimum Entropy (N-NIR & SWIR-11) threshold values for the ARB, however, the Minimum Entropy also had poor detection of surface water (low recall). Use of the naive Bayesian classifier did not improve detection of surface water compared to using threshold values alone, and the use of threshold values generated for one basin was not transferable to another basin. We concluded that threshold methods should be assessed seasonally, at a per-tile scale before combining surface water products at a watershed scale, and products should be evaluated using non-balanced statistical measures for watersheds with high land-to-water ratios. Accuracy assessment is hampered by validation data which represents static hydrologic conditions, not contemporary, seasonal conditions.

TI  - Influence of atmospheric adjacency effect on top-of-atmosphere radiances and its correction in the retrieval of Lambertian surface reflectivity based on three-dimensional radiative transfer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In satellite-based and airborne imagery, the observed radiances reflected by a certain pixel at the surface are additionally influenced by reflections from the neighboring surface pixels and multiple scatterings due to atmospheric components (mainly cloud and aerosol particles) into the observational solid angle of the imaging camera. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the atmospheric adjacency effect. This three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effect is caused by spatial inhomogeneities of the surface reflectivity and the atmospheric properties. Based on the recently published 3D radiative transfer code LEIPSIC (Light Estimator Including Polarization, Surface Inhomogeneities, and Clouds), a new atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm is proposed to consider for the atmospheric adjacency effect when estimating the surface reflectivity from satellite or airborne imagery. The effectiveness of the new AC algorithm is quantified and compared to the results based on the independent pixel approximation (IPA) radiative transfer approach. It is shown that the image blurring caused by the atmospheric adjacency effect and the error of reflectivity retrievals are reduced by 80% using the new AC algorithm. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that the vertical profile of the atmospheric properties is crucial in determining the quality of the AC.

TI  - An improved fully convolution network model for change detection in mining areas using sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite images have recently been widely used for change detection of mineral resources and mining area environments. However, with their increasing resolution and number of feature sub-categories, traditional machine learning methods have become sensitive to pseudo-changes and intra-class changes, which are prone to producing misclassifications. To address these problems, a novel fully convolutional network, the Hybrid Dilated Convolutional Siamese Network (HDC-Siam) was proposed. This model combines the modular dilated convolution network with the fully convolutional Siamese networks structure, in order to reduce the commission rate. In this paper, pairs of Sentinel-2 images with an interval of about two years was used as the experimental data. The HDC-Siam model was used to detect changes, where we evaluated the accuracy in the Dongsheng coalfield in Ordos, China and the Kuznetsk coalfield in Kemerovo, Russia. We obtained F (1)-scores of 85% and 75% for these respective locations. In addition, we conducted comparative experiments using two other methods - Fully Convolutional Siamese - Difference (FC-Siam-diff) and Fully Convolutional Early Fusion (FC-EF) - in order to verify that the HDC-Siam works.

TI  - Exploring the linkage between seasonality of environmental factors and COVID-19 waves in Madrid, Spain
T2  - PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Like several countries, Spain experienced a multi wave pattern of COVID-19 pandemic over more than one year period, between spring 2020 and spring 2021. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is a multi-factorial process involving among other factors outdoor environmental variables and viral inactivation.This study aims to quantify the impact of climate and air pollution factors seasonality on incidence and severity of COVID-19 disease waves in Madrid metropolitan region in Spain. We employed descriptive statistics and Spearman rank correlation tests for analysis of daily in-situ and geospatial time-series of air quality and climate data to investigate the associations with COVID-19 incidence and lethality in Madrid under different synoptic meteorological patterns. During the analyzed period (1 January 2020-28 February 2021), with one month before each of three COVID-19 waves were recorded anomalous anticyclonic circulations in the mid-troposphere, with positive anomalies of geopotential heights at 500 mb and favorable stability conditions for SARS-CoV-2 fast diffusion. In addition, the results reveal that air temperature, Planetary Boundary Layer height, ground level ozone have a significant negative relationship with daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. The findings of this study provide useful information to the public health authorities and policymakers for optimizing interventions during pandemics. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - How can we better prepare new doctors for the tasks and challenges of ward rounds?: An observational study of junior doctors' experiences
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Ward rounds play a crucial role in the delivery of patient care in inpatient settings, but involve a complex mix of tasks, skills and challenges for junior doctors to negotiate. This study informs the development of high-quality training by identifying the activities that junior doctors perform, and those associated with stress during real-life ward rounds. Materials and methods All activities performed by FY1 doctors (n = 60) over 2 ward rounds were coded in real-time by a trained observer using the work observation method by activity timing (WOMBAT). Doctors' heart rate was continuously recorded and non-metabolic peaks in heart rate used as a physiological indicator of stress. Results During ward rounds, FY1 doctors commonly engaged in indirect patient care, professional communication, documentation and observation. Very little time was spent on direct patient care (6%) or explicit supervision/education (0.01%). Heart rate data indicated that stress was highest during administrative tasks while interacting directly with patients while stepping out of rounds to complete personal tasks, when answering bleeps and while multi-tasking. Conclusions Training that specifically covers the activities involved, skills required, and challenges inherent in real-life ward rounds may better prepare FY doctors for this complex area of practice.

TI  - Satellite time series data reveal interannual and seasonal spatiotemporal evapotranspiration patterns in China in response to effect factors
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) are the basic problem of the circulation of water resources. Several studies have reported the spatiotemporal patterns of ET. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of seasonal ET patterns over large areas, and the factors affecting ET under variable environmental conditions are still uncertain. In this study, flux observation data was used to evaluate the performance of MOD16 (the MODIS global ET product) data under different conditions, and then the MOD16 data were used to analyze the interannual and seasonal variability of ET and its spatial distribution characteristics in China. Furthermore, path analysis was used to analyze the factors affecting the change of ET. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) MOD16 data are sufficiently reliable and meet the precision requirements for research; (2) the vegetation ET in China showed significant temporal and spatial differences at the interannual and seasonal timescales, respectively, with an average annual value of 359.61 mm between 2001 and 2018; (3) the ET in China showed an upward trend in 2001-2018, with an average change rate of 2.95 mm/year, and exhibited differences in various seasons and for different vegetation types; (4) surface vegetation are the main factors affecting ET in southeast of China, while in northwest, the ET variation is affected by multiple factors. Under the conditions of climate change and vegetation cover change, several strategies should be implemented to deal with the sustained increase of vegetation water consumption, for example, the adjustment of agricultural production structure and the optimization of planting structure. The ET change law obtained in this study can be used as a reference for water resource regulation and management.

TI  - An Exploratory Model of Family Resilience Processes and Functioning: A Cultural Perspective of the Semai Indigenous Communities in Perak, Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the challenges experienced by the Semai indigenous communities in Perak, Malaysia, and their distinct cultural beliefs, it is important to understand the role of the social and cultural networks in their resilience processes. In particular, further attention needs to be paid to how their families function and shape their beliefs about their lives, as there might be key mechanisms and processes that differ from existing general conceptualizations of family. This grounded theory analysis of 23 Semai Orang Asli (indigenous) community members established a model of the Semai's family conceptualization and functioning. Findings revealed that the Semai's concept of family encompasses an extensive network of individuals with their shared relationship with nyenang (spirit ancestors) and cultural heritage, which in turn leads them to have a deep sense of shared family identity and connectedness. This worldview guided the Semai's family processes and functioning, captured by the following five dimensions: sharing obligations and responsibilities, making collective decisions, prioritizing community's welfare, sharing of knowledge and resources, and willingness to work with everyone. These factors facilitate a conducive and supportive environment aimed at maintaining existing family relationships. This model can guide the development of culturally specific programs that promote and strengthen indigenous family relationships and resilience.

TI  - Is it possible to detect boron deficiency in eucalyptus using hyper and multispectral sensors?
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Boron (B) is an essential element whose deficiency results in rapid inhibition in the growth of plants, acting on their meristematic growth. Real-time monitoring of B fertilization in eucalyptus is helpful for guiding precision diagnosis and efficient management of plant boron nutrition. This research hypothesizes that different boron levels alter the reflectance of different wavelengths in eucalyptus. In this context, the objective of this study was to identify spectral ranges that can be used to monitor the boron status in eucalyptus plants. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, in which the treatments consisted of increasing boron levels in the form of boric acid (17% of B), whose levels varied from deficit to toxicity. Thus, five treatments were established: no boron, 1, 10, 20, and 40 mg/dm3 of boron. The remote sensing data used were bands, heights, and vegetation indices calculated after obtaining the spectral curves in each treatment. Our findings show that it is possible to accurately distinguish the boron levels in eucalyptus using hyper and multispectral bands. The 350-371 nm spectral range can be used for detecting boron-deficient plants. Plants with adequate boron levels can be identified by using the 426-444 nm, 1811-1910 nm, 1948-2115 nm, and 2124-2208 nm spectral ranges. Finally, the 425-475 nm spectral range can be used to find boron-toxicity plants.

TI  - Biotic vs abiotic controls on temporal sensitivity of primary production to precipitation across North American drylands
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland net primary productivity (NPP) is sensitive to temporal variation in precipitation (PPT), but the magnitude of this 'temporal sensitivity' varies spatially. Hypotheses for spatial variation in temporal sensitivity have often emphasized abiotic factors, such as moisture limitation, while overlooking biotic factors, such as vegetation structure. We tested these hypotheses using spatiotemporal models fit to remote-sensing data sets to assess how vegetation structure and climate influence temporal sensitivity across five dryland ecoregions of the western USA. Temporal sensitivity was higher in locations and ecoregions dominated by herbaceous vegetation. By contrast, much less spatial variation in temporal sensitivity was explained by mean annual PPT. In fact, ecoregion-specific models showed inconsistent associations of sensitivity and PPT; whereas sensitivity decreased with increasing mean annual PPT in most ecoregions, it increased with mean annual PPT in the most arid ecoregion, the hot deserts. The strong, positive influence of herbaceous vegetation on temporal sensitivity indicates that herbaceous-dominated drylands will be particularly sensitive to future increases in precipitation variability and that dramatic changes in cover type caused by invasions or shrub encroachment will lead to changes in dryland NPP dynamics, perhaps independent of changes in precipitation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the spatiotemporal coverage of remote sensing (RS) products, such as sea surface chlorophyll concentration (SSCC), can offer a better understanding of the spatiotemporal SSCC distribution for ocean management purposes. In the first part of this work, 834 in-situ SSCC measurements of the SeaBASS-NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) during 2002-2016 served as the empirical dataset. A moving window with +/- 3 days and +/- 0.5 degrees centered at each of the in-situ SSCC measurements established a search neighborhood for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Level 2 (MODIS L2) SSCC and MODIS L2 sea surface temperature (SST) data, and the matched SSCC and SST data were used for building a linear SSCC-SST relationship. The unmatched SST was introduced to the linear model for generating soft SSCC data with uniform distributions. The inherent spatiotemporal dependency of the SSCC distribution was then represented by the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method, which incorporated the soft SSCC data as auxiliary variable for SSCC estimation and mapping purposes. The results showed that a 75.3% accuracy improvement of remote SSCC retrieval in terms of R-2 can be achieved by BME-based method compared to the original MODIS L2 product. Subsequently, the BME-based method was applied to obtain daily SSCC dataset in Chesapeake Bay (USA) during the period 2010-2019. It was found that the SSCC distribution exhibited a decreasing spatial trend from the upper bay to the outer bay, whereas decreasing and increasing temporal trends were detected during the periods 2011-2014 and 2016-2019, respectively. The generalized Cauchy process was used to quantitatively describe the autocorrelation SSCC function in the Chesapeake Bay. The results showed that the outer bay exhibited the strongest long-range dependence among the four sub-regions, whereas the middle bay exhibited the weakest long-range dependence. Finally, one-point and two-point stochastic site indicators (SSIs) were employed to explore the spatiotemporal SSCC characteristics in Chesapeake Bay. The one-point SSI results showed that nearly 100% of the upper, middle and the lower bay areas experienced a high SSCC level (>5 mg/m(3)) during the entire study period. The area with SSCC>5 mg/m(3) in the outer bay increased a lot during the winter season, but the area with SSCC>10 or 20 mg/m(3) decreased significantly in the upper, middle and lower bay. Simultaneously, the SSCC dispersion in these areas was rather small during the winter season. On the other hand, the two-point SSI results showed that although the SSCC levels differ among the four sub-regions, but the SSCC connectivity structures between pairs of points also displayed some similarities in terms of their spatiotemporal dependency. In conclusion, the proposed BME-based method was shown to be a promising remote SSCC mapping technique that exhibited a powerful ability to improve both accuracy and coverage of RS products. The SSIs can be also used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of a variety of natural attributes in waters. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ancient landslide in Wanzhou District analysis from 2015 to 2018 based on ALOS-2 data by QPS-InSAR
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is a global environmental geological hazard caused by natural or human activities. Since the impoundment of the Three Gorges reservoir area, the geological disasters such as collapses, landslides and other kinds of geological disasters increased obviously due to the periodic fluctuation of the water level in the Yangtze River. Wanzhou District is located in the center of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, which plays an important role in the prevention and control of geological hazards in the whole Three Gorges Reservoir Area. This is because a large number of deep bedrocks old landslides are distributed among this region, such as Taibaiyan ancient landslide, Caojiezi ancient landslide, Anlesi ancient landslide, Pipaping ancient landslide, and Diaoyanping ancient landslide. In this study, Quasi-Persistent Scatterers InSAR (QPS-InSAR) time-series method is proposed to identify and monitor the ancient landslides in Wanzhou. In this method, the High-coherent test is applied to Quasi-Persistent Scatterers (PSC) selection, and PSC and persistent scatterer are combined to improve the density of measurement points in vegetation area. The QPS-InSAR method is also characterized by the appropriate combination of differential interferograms produced by a Minimum Spanning Tree and the employment of the phase triangulation algorithm to estimate the optimal phase. This technique was performed on 8 scenes of L-band ALOS PALSAR ascending data acquired during 2015-2018, then deformation rate maps and time series for ancient landslide were generated, which were applied to retrieve time series displacement for the large-scale landslide in Wanzhou District. The experiment results show that there are obvious landslide deformation patterns detected in this region with displacement velocity larger than - 21 mm/yr during the observation period. Finally, the influencing factors such as geological conditions, distribution of rainfall and reservoir water level change in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, and deformation mechanism of Wanzhou landslide are analyzed. The monitoring results will help the local government to carry out regular landslide inspection and strengthen landslide disaster early warning.

TI  - Southern Ocean cloud and aerosol data: a compilation of measurements from the 2018 Southern Ocean Ross Sea Marine Ecosystems and Environment voyage
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its remote location and extreme weather conditions, atmospheric in situ measurements are rare in the Southern Ocean. As a result, aerosol-cloud interactions in this region are poorly understood and remain a major source of uncertainty in climate models. This, in turn, contributes substantially to persistent biases in climate model simulations such as the well-known positive shortwave radiation bias at the surface, as well as biases in numerical weather prediction models and reanalyses. It has been shown in previous studies that in situ and ground-based remote sensing measurements across the Southern Ocean are critical for complementing satellite data sets due to the importance of boundary layer and low-level cloud processes. These processes are poorly sampled by satellite-based measurements and are often obscured by multiple overlying cloud layers. Satellite measurements also do not constrain the aerosol-cloud processes very well with imprecise estimation of cloud condensation nuclei. In this work, we present a comprehensive set of ship-based aerosol and meteorological observations collected on the 6-week Southern Ocean Ross Sea Marine Ecosystem and Environment voyage (TAN1802) voyage of RV Tangaroa across the Southern Ocean, fromWellington, New Zealand, to the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The voyage was carried out from 8 February to 21March 2018. Many distinct, but contemporaneous, data sets were collected throughout the voyage. The compiled data sets include measurements from a range of instruments, such as (i) meteorological conditions at the sea surface and profile measurements; (ii) the size and concentration of particles; (iii) trace gases dissolved in the ocean surface such as dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide; (iv) and remotely sensed observations of low clouds. Here, we describe the voyage, the instruments, and data processing, and provide a brief overview of some of the data products available. We encourage the scientific community to use these measurements for further analysis and model evaluation studies, in particular, for studies of Southern Ocean clouds, aerosol, and their interaction.

TI  - Spatial disparities in trade-offs: economic and environmental impacts of road infrastructure on continental level
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and geospatial techniques are being used to provide large-scale and regional solutions for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, including sustainable infrastructure development. Road transportation infrastructure has a significant contribution to the economy, but it also increases environmental pressure. However, little knowledge is available about spatial characteristics in the relationship between road impacts on the economy and impacts on the roadside environment. This research explores the spatial disparities in the relationship of road impacts on a continental level in Australia from 2011 to 2016. The performance of road transportation infrastructure is characterized from the perspectives of road density, connectivity, traffic volumes, and service to communities, other transportations (e.g. ports and airports), and industries, using remote sensing data and spatial heterogeneity models. Local economy and roadside environment are respectively presented using resident income and the change of roadside Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite generated from Google Earth Engine. The road impacts of variables and their interaction on the economy and environment were calculated using an optimal parameters-based geographical detectors model (OPGD). Results reveal that the interaction of road density and traffic volumes can explain 47.4% of the resident income. In addition, results demonstrate the significant spatial disparities in the relationship between road impacts on the economy and impacts on the local environment. In major cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne, the pressure of roadside environment is increased with the economic growth, but the roadside environment has been improved in suburban and rural areas. Areas with the service to industries range from 64.4 km to 128 km have the most significant roadside EVI increase (2.5%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to explore spatially differentiated trade-offs between the economic and roadside environmental impacts of roads using remotely sensed data, geospatial data, and spatial heterogeneity model at the continental level. Findings from this study provide an in-depth understanding of the interactions and trade-offs of road impacts on the local economy and the environment. Geospatial trade-offs and impact analysis methods in the study can be applied in wider fields to achieve global and regional SDGs.

TI  - Diagnostic and prognostic impact of cytokeratin 19 expression analysis in human tumors: a tissue microarray study of 13,172 tumors
T2  - HUMAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate cytokeratin 19 (CK19) expression in normal and cancerous tissues, 15,977 samples from 122 tumor types and 608 samples of 76 normal tissue types were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In normal tissues, CK19 expression occurred in epithelial cells of most glandular organs but was strictly limited to the basal cell layer of nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium and absent in the skin. CK19 expression in >= 90% of cases was seen in 34% of the tumor entities including the adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (99.4%), colorectum (99.8%), esophagus (98.7%), and stomach (97.7%), as well as breast cancer (90.0%-100%), high-grade serous (99.1%) or endometrioid (97.8%) ovarian cancer, and urothelial carcinoma (92.6%-100%). A low CK19 positivity rate (0.1 -10%) was seen in 5 of 122 tumor entities including hepatocellular carcinoma and seminoma. A comparison of tumor versus normal tissue findings demonstrated that upregulation and downregulation of CK19 can occur in cancer and that both alterations can be linked to unfavorable phenotypes. CK19 downregulation was linked to high grade (p = 0.0017) and loss of estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-expression (p < 0.0001 each) in invasive breast carcinoma of no special type. CK19 upregulation was linked to nodal metastases in neuroendocrine tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (p < 0.05 each) and to poor grade in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (p < 0.05). CK19 upregulation was particularly common in squamous cell carcinomas. We concluded that CK19 IHC might separate primary liver cell carcinoma from liver metastases, seminoma from other testicular tumors, and helps in the detection of early neoplastic transformation in squamous epithelium.

TI  - Using Whole Genome Sequences to Investigate Adenovirus Outbreaks in a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent surge in human mastadenovirus (HAdV) cases, including five deaths, amongst a haematopoietic stem cell transplant population led us to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate. We compared sequences from 37 patients collected over a 20-month period with sequences from GenBank and our own database of HAdVs. Maximum likelihood trees and pairwise differences were used to evaluate genotypic relationships, paired with the epidemiological data from routine infection prevention and control (IPC) records and hospital activity data. During this time period, two formal outbreaks had been declared by IPC, while WGS detected nine monophyletic clusters, seven were corroborated by epidemiological evidence and by comparison of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One of the formal outbreaks was confirmed, and the other was not. Of the five HAdV-associated deaths, three were unlinked and the remaining two considered the source of transmission. Mixed infection was frequent (10%), providing a sentinel source of recombination and superinfection. Immunosuppressed patients harboring a high rate of HAdV positivity require comprehensive surveillance. As a consequence of these findings, HAdV WGS is being incorporated routinely into clinical practice to influence IPC policy contemporaneously.

TI  - Deriving Arctic 2 m air temperatures over snow and ice from satellite surface temperature measurements
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic region is responding heavily to climate change, and yet, the air temperature of ice-covered areas in the Arctic is heavily under-sampled when it comes to in situ measurements, resulting in large uncertainties in existing weather and reanalysis products. This paper presents a method for estimating daily mean clear-sky 2 m air temperatures (T2m) in the Arctic from satellite observations of skin temperature, using the Arctic and Antarctic ice Surface Temperatures from thermal Infrared (AASTI) satellite dataset, providing spatially detailed observations of the Arctic. The method is based on a linear regression model, which has been tuned against in situ observations to estimate daily mean T2m based on clear-sky satellite ice surface skin temperatures. The daily satellite-derived T2m product includes estimated uncertainties and covers the Arctic sea ice and the Greenland Ice Sheet during clear skies for the period 2000-2009, provided on a 0.25 degrees regular latitude-longitude grid. Comparisons with independent in situ measured T2m show average biases of 0.30 and 0.35 degrees C and average root-mean-square errors of 3.47 and 3.20 degrees C for land ice and sea ice, respectively. The associated uncertainties are verified to be very realistic for both land ice and sea ice, using in situ observations. The reconstruction provides a much better spatial coverage than the sparse in situ observations of T2m in the Arctic and is independent of numerical weather prediction model input. Therefore, it provides an important supplement to simulated air temperatures to be used for assimilation or global surface temperature reconstructions. A comparison of T2m derived from satellite and ERA-Interim/ERAS estimates shows that the satellite-derived T2m validates similar to or better than ERA-Interim/ERAS against in situ measurements in the Arctic.

TI  - Coastal complexity of the Antarctic continent
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic outer coastal margin (i.e. the coastline itself or the terminus or front of ice shelves, whichever is adjacent to the ocean) is a key interface between the ice sheet and terrestrial environments and the Southern Ocean. Its physical configuration (including both length scale of variation, orientation, and aspect) has direct bearing on several closely associated cryospheric, biological, oceanographical, and ecological processes, yet no study has quantified the coastal complexity or orientation of Antarctica's coastal margin. This first-of-a-kind characterization of Antarctic coastal complexity aims to address this knowledge gap. We quantify and investigate the physical configuration and complexity of Antarctica's circumpolar outer coastal margin using a novel technique based on similar to 40 000 random points selected along a vector coastline derived from the MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica dataset. At each point, a complexity metric is calculated at length scales from 1 to 256 km, giving a multiscale estimate of the magnitude and direction of undulation or complexity at each point location along the entire coastline. Using a cluster analysis to determine characteristic complexity "signatures" for random nodes, the coastline is found to comprise three basic groups or classes: (i) low complexity at all scales, (ii) most complexity at shorter scales, and (iii) most complexity at longer scales. These classes are somewhat heterogeneously distributed throughout the continent. We also consider bays and peninsulas separately and characterize their multiscale orientation. This unique dataset and its summary analysis have numerous applications for both geophysical and biological studies.

TI  - Combined use of environmental and spectral variables with vegetation archives for large-scale modeling of grassland habitats
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland habitats provide many ecosystem services but are threatened by agricultural intensification and urbanization. While the lack of accurate and comprehensive inventories at the national scale makes them difficult to manage, advances in spatial modeling using open remote sensing data and open-source software, as well as the increasing use of ecological archives, provide new perspectives for mapping natural habitats. In this context, this study evaluated the contribution of spectral and environmental variables to discriminate and then map grassland habitats throughout France. To this end, 92 spectral variables derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data, 19 bioclimatic variables derived from WorldClim data, 4 topographic variables derived from the European Union Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and 8 soil variables derived from SoilGrids data were combined at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Reference plots that characterized 6 and 21 grassland ecosystems at European Nature Information System (EUNIS) levels 2 (broad habitats) and 3 (habitats), respectively, were collected from vegetation archives. We first performed descriptive analysis that included habitat description, ordination, and pairwise separability. We then performed predictive analysis of grassland habitats using a cross-validated random forest model that included a spatial constraint. While environmental and spectral variables characterized most grassland habitats well and consistently, some confusion occurred between habitats with similar abiotic conditions. The main grassland habitat types were correctly mapped at EUNIS level 2 (F1 score = 0.68), but not at EUNIS level 3 (F1 score = 0.52). In addition, the two variables that contributed most to the model were the near-infrared spectral band in spring and the minimum temperature of the coldest month. The model's prediction at EUNIS level 2 for mainland France provides the map of grassland habitats at a new spatial scale.

TI  - Projecting complex interactions between forest harvest and succession in the northern Acadian Forest Region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Preventing declines of native and historically-abundant tree species is an important aspect of sustainable forest management, but predicting future forest composition is challenging when succession does not tend to follow a well-defined path. We evaluated the implications of site-level interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession on the regional landscape dynamics of the complex and species-rich northern Acadian Forest Region. Our expectation was that forest composition would trend away from long-lived and shade-tolerant species, because rates of landscape disturbance from timber harvesting are high relative to historic rates of natural disturbance. We used a novel modeling approach that combined Landsat-derived time series of forest disturbance to inform realistic simulations of timber harvesting across many individual commercial forest landowners using LANDIS-II, and evaluated changes in tree species' distributions and abundance with and without harvesting. Detailed descriptions of initial forest conditions were derived from maps of relative tree species abundance, developed using Landsat satellite imagery, regional inventory data, and an innovative machine learning algorithm. If recent harvest rates persist, simulations suggest timber harvesting will generally be sustainable in our study area; however, projected rates of site-level species turnover were high, predominantly favoring species that were less abundant under the region's natural disturbance regime. As a result, broad-scale patterns of projected species co-occurrence shifted, destabilizing important regional forest types. Our results highlight both the region's capacity for forest growth and the importance of accurately capturing the local effects of land management when projecting forested regions dominated by commercial ownership.

TI  - Floating marine litter detection algorithms and techniques using optical remote sensing data: A review
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Floating Marine Litter (FML) are mainly plastics or synthetic polymers that float on the sea surface after being deliberately discarded or unintentionally lost along beaches, rivers or marine environments. In recent years, much focus has been placed on locating, tracking and removing plastic items in both coastal areas and in the open ocean. The use of high-resolution multispectral satellite images for such purpose is very promising, since satellite images can systematically monitor much larger areas in comparison to the traditional in situ observations. This paper contains a literature review of the published research regarding the optical remote detection of floating marine debris and the proposed associated methodologies. The main aim of this review is to compile all available information on detection methodologies, providing at the same time valuable insights into the different approaches used for floating marine litter monitoring. First, a brief introduction into the theoretical basis of a spaceborne floating marine litter detection system is given. Next, published articles, or relevant research work have been compartmentalised, for analysing the proposed procedures and assisting in a further assessment of their methodological frameworks. Lastly, conclusions and bottlenecks of the existing knowledge on marine litter detection from space are derived. Although the remote detection of floating marine litter is currently limited by inherent restrictions of the available satellite sensors specifications, we highlight how the methodological processing chain can significantly affect the future accuracy of plastic detection from space.

TI  - Modelling Forest Aboveground Biomass Based on GF-3 Dual-Polarized and WorldView-3 Data: A Case Study in Datong National Wetland Park, China
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) models based on field-measured and remote-sensed data can help to understand and monitor ecosystems and evaluate the impacts of human activity. To create improved forest AGB models for use in an ecological rehabilitation area of Huainan, China, a suite of methods was used to evaluate a combination of the Chinese GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and vegetation indexes derived from the WorldView-3 satellite. Using vegetation indices and radar backscatter coefficients, a total of six modelling methods were applied to generate three AGB models, which included multivariable linear regression, linear, exponential, power, logarithmic, and growth functions. The results indicate that the observed root mean square errors (RMSE) of the best models, which included exponential functions based on the variables NDVI and HV, as well as their combination in a multivariable linear regression, were 43.74 Mg/ha, 30.87 Mg/ha, and 26.72 Mg/ha, respectively. The best model used multivariable linear regression with combined SAR and NDVI data (R-2 = 0.861). The RMSEs were lowest for mixed forest, moderate for coniferous forest, and highest for broad-leaved forest. The results indicate that a combination of optical and microwave remote-sensing images can be used to effectively improve AGB estimation accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation of vicarious calibration for airborne sensors using RadCalNet
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration approaches using in-situ measurements are key techniques applied to on-orbit remote sensors. The in-situ measurements have advantages in terms of traceability and quantifiable accuracy that make them ideal for inter-consistency studies of on-orbit sensors. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Working Group on Calibration and Validation Infrared Visible Optical Sensors initiated the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) to provide automated surface and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data from multiple participating ground sites to the worldwide user community. RadCalNet standardizes protocols for collecting data, processes TOA reflectance, and provides International System of Units traceable uncertainty budgets for the five currently operating sites. RadCalNet data from the Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada, site was used to provide an SI-traceable, absolute radiometric calibration of the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator as part of an overflight of opportunity during the FIREX-AQ campaign. The results shown here demonstrate the utility of RadCalNet data for absolute radiometric calibration of airborne imagers making flights of opportunity without the need for coordination with a field validation team.

TI  - Elective management of regional nodal basins in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Controversies and contemporary perspectives
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is among the most common cancers worldwide, with an incidence that continues to rise. Although cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) constitutes only approximately 20% of such cases, it represents the most common cause of NMSC mortality, owing largely to the propensity for development of regional lymph node metastases (LNM), which, when present, carry a dismal prognosis. Whilst overall rates of LNM are low, there are a number of patient and tumour factors that likely confer considerably higher risks, which has led several investigators to propose more proactive elective management of regional nodal basins in selected high-risk cases. Current international guidelines, however, do not recommend any elective treatment or sampling of regional nodal basins in the absence of clinically apparent disease. The purpose of this review is to explore in detail the fundamental issues underlying this controversy, focusing specifically on cSCC of the head and neck (cSCCHN). In particular the rationale for more a proactive elective approach to regional nodal basins, including the evidence-base underlying identification of potentially high-risk factors for development of LNM is discussed, along with oncological outcomes for those patients that do go onto suffer LNM. We also provide contemporary perspectives and evidence for approaches to electively managing regional nodal basins, and offer insight into how these may develop both in the clinical and research arenas.

TI  - Improving winter wheat biomass and evapotranspiration simulation by assimilating leaf area index from spectral information into a crop growth model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation, a state-of-the-art method that merges remote sensing data with a dynamic model to improve model performance, has been widely used in land surface process modeling. Application of data assimilation under various water conditions can provide insight of crop response to different water supply rates, which is useful for agricultural water management in arid and semi-arid regions. For this purpose, we developed a generic data assimilation methodology by integrating both the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) and the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithms into the Simple Algorithm For Yield and Evapotranspiration (SAFYE) model to provide improved simulation of winter wheat biomass and yield, and simulation of evapotranspiration (ET) under different water-supply scenarios. An experiment with nine irrigation scenarios was conducted during the 2013-2015 growing cycles. Field spectral data were employed to retrieve the leaf area index (LAI), which was then used as a single state variable to determine other parameters in the SAFYE model using a global optimization algorithm. Time-series LAI was eventually assimilated in the SAFYE model based on the EnKF algorithm to improve overall model simulation. The results showed that the simulated crop growth dynamics followed the measurements well in most cases when the estimated LAI was assimilated. The accuracy of simulated biomass at the daily step was improved, with the maximum RMSE decreased from 199.4 to 123.8 g m- 2 and from 466.6 to 393.4 g m- 2 for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 growing seasons respectively. A good agreement was also achieved between the estimated and field measured grain yield (R2 = 0.901, RMSE= 31.9 g m- 2, RRMSE=6.55%) for both growing seasons. The simulation of soil water content in the top 0-20 cm soil layer was better (RMSE: 3.3-5.0 mm) than that of 0-100 cm layer (RMSE: 11.7-29.6 mm). Accuracy of the simulated ET under early-stage water deficit scenarios was lower than that under other scenarios, with a positive mean relative error of 14% (3.4-24.3%) during two growing seasons. This study demonstrates the great potential of coupling remote sensing data to improve the performance of SAFYE model in modeling winter wheat growth.

TI  - Coastline changes in mainland China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline is an indicator line for human exploitation in the coastal zone. With the acceleration of human development and climate change, changes in the coastal zone are more active than ever. Quickly extracting the coastline and monitoring its changes in real time is of great significance for enacting the development and utilisation planning of coastal zones. In this research, we developed an automatic-coastline-extraction technique based on edge detection and object-oriented in complex situations. Meanwhile, on the basis of Landsat TM images, it realised the extraction of the mainland China coastline. Accuracy comparison showed that the matching commission and omission errors between the extracted and reference coastlines within two-pixel radii were 8% and 5%, respectively. The Overall quality reached as high as 87%, achieving an overall mapping accuracy of 1:250,000. We also constructed the index system of coastline exploitation and utilisation to analyse changes of the continental coastline from 2000 to 2015. It was found that natural and economic conditions affected coastline changes, in which the sea-expansion trend of northern China was more concentrated on a larger scale and with a higher load in coastline development and utilisation, while the southern region of China was relatively stable.

TI  - Monitoring and investigating dust phenomenon on using remote sensing science, geographical information system and statistical methods
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Dust is a phenomenon occurring in most parts of the world causing financial loss and adverse environmental effects and impacts. Many parameters are involved in dust phenomenon occurrence, some of which are natural and some of them are due to human processes and their influence on the environment. Monitoring the environmental changes can be worthwhile and efficient procrastination the occurrence of this phenomenon. In this research, we scrutinized the Persian and English database in a structured way using dust keywords, heavy metals, remote sensing, geographical information systems and statistical methods. Articles taking into consideration these three fields were retrieved, analyzed descriptively and reported. In accordance with this methodology, the study was conducted in a period from 1992 to 2016. Findings: Among the methods used, the method of interpolation, zoning of dust and their distribution with GIS is more applicable, and among satellite images, MODIS images are the most applicable ones. The results obtained from this study indicated that statistical methods, remote sensing and geographical information system are among effective tools in studying germane researches done on dust monitoring and detection.

TI  - An Open Source Approach for Near-Real Time Mapping of Oil Spills along the Mediterranean Coast of Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil pollution is one of the major critical risks to the Egypt's marine environment due to the heavy traffic caused by shipping in the Suez Canal and the exploration and production of crude oil. Indeed, such frequent oil pollution cases harm to the marine ecosystem and creates pressure on the socio-economic activities within the coastal economic zone of Egypt. Limited data availability creates obstacles to the precise monitoring of oil pollution and the ability to alert the environment agency to take any necessary actions. This research explored the potentiality of developing an open-source model with the use of open-access Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agency to operationally monitor oil pollution at near-real time. As such, early detection and quantification of the volume of pollution creates an early warning system that supports decision makers in clean-up operations and the prosecution of the polluter. The developed model uses an open-source GIS system and Sentinel-1 SAR data to robustly detect and map oil spills and create an a report to alert the appropriate agency of the spill. The model examined a large amount of data, nearly 2000 scenes from the Sentinel 1 SAR sensor, that cover the area of study from 2014 to 2020. The model detected approximately 218 oil pollution cases within this time frame, with about 35% occurring in 2017 alone. The statistical analysis and frequency of oil pollution is mapped near the entrance of Suez Canal and the city of Port Said. This area is known as the anchoring area for the maritime ships that travel via the Suez Canal, and there are also oil and gas production nearby. It was found that the drift direction of the oil spills near Port Said move southwards, which creates a hazard for local fishing activities, Port Said touristic beaches, and marine ports. This model is the scientific and practical solution for the city council and the environmental agency to continuously monitor and receive alerts regarding any oil pollution cases in order to protect the coastal and marine socio-economic ecosystem and maintain sustainability.

TI  - Land Degradation Vulnerability Mapping in a Newly-Reclaimed Desert Oasis in a Hyper-Arid Agro-Ecosystem Using AHP and Geospatial Techniques
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling land degradation vulnerability (LDV) in the newly-reclaimed desert oases is a key factor for sustainable agricultural production. In the present work, a trial for using remote sensing data, GIS tools, and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was conducted for modeling and evaluating LDV. The model was then applied within 144,566 ha in Farafra, an inland hyper-arid Western Desert Oases in Egypt. Data collected from climate conditions, geological maps, remote sensing imageries, field observations, and laboratory analyses were conducted and subjected to AHP to develop six indices. They included geology index (GI), topographic quality index (TQI), physical soil quality index (PSQI), chemical soil quality index (CSQI), wind erosion quality index (WEQI), and vegetation quality index (VQI). Weights derived from the AHP showed that the effective drivers of LDV in the studied area were as follows: CSQI (0.30) > PSQI (0.29) > VQI (0.17) > TQI (0.12) > GI (0.07) > WEQI (0.05). The LDV map indicated that nearly 85% of the total area was prone to moderate degradation risks, 11% was prone to high risks, while less than 1% was prone to low risks. The consistency ratio (CR) for all studied parameters and indices were less than 0.1, demonstrating the high accuracy of the AHP. The results of the cross-validation demonstrated that the performance of ordinary kriging models (spherical, exponential, and Gaussian) was suitable and reliable for predicting and mapping soil properties. Integrated use of remote sensing data, GIS, and AHP would provide an effective methodology for predicting LDV in desert oases, by which proper management strategies could be adopted to achieve sustainable food security.

TI  - Observing Thermal Conditions of Historic Buildings through Earth Observation Data and Big Data Engine
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combines satellite observation, cloud platforms, and geographical information systems (GIS) to investigate at a macro-scale level of observation the thermal conditions of two historic clusters in Cyprus, namely in Limassol and Strovolos municipalities. The two case studies share different environmental and climatic conditions. The former site is coastal, the last a hinterland, and they both contain historic buildings with similar building materials and techniques. For the needs of the study, more than 140 Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 LDCM images were processed at the Google Earth Engine big data cloud platform to investigate the thermal conditions of the two historic clusters over the period 2013-2020. The multi-temporal thermal analysis included the calibration of all images to provide land surface temperature (LST) products at a 100 m spatial resolution. Moreover, to investigate anomalies related to possible land cover changes of the area, two indices were extracted from the satellite images, the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalised difference build index (NDBI). Anticipated results include the macro-scale identification of multi-temporal changes, diachronic changes, the establishment of change patterns based on seasonality and location, occurring in large clusters of historic buildings.

TI  - Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation and Mapping through High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery-A Literature Review
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation and mapping through high-resolution optical satellite imagery (<= 5 m spatial resolution). Based on the literature review, 44 peer-reviewed journal articles were published in 15 years (2004-2019). Twenty-one studies were conducted in Asia, eight in North America and Africa, five in South America, and four in Europe. This review article gives a glance at the published methodologies for AGB prediction modeling and validation. The literature review suggested that, along with the integration of other sensors, QuickBird, WorldView-2, and IKONOS satellite images were most widely used for AGB estimations, with higher estimation accuracies. All studies were grouped into six satellite-derived independent variables, including tree crown, image textures, tree shadow fraction, canopy height, vegetation indices, and multiple variables. Using these satellite-derived independent variables, most of the studies used linear regression (41%), while 30% used linear multiple regression and 18% used non-linear (machine learning) regression, while very few (11%) studies used non-linear (multiple and exponential) regression for estimating AGB. In the context of global forest AGB estimations and monitoring, the advantages, strengths, and limitations were discussed to achieve better accuracy and transparency towards the performance-based payment mechanism of the REDD+ program. Apart from technical limitations, we realized that very few studies talked about real-time monitoring of AGB or quantifying AGB change, a dimension that needs exploration.

TI  - Paraaortic sentinel lymph node detection in intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer by transvaginal ultrasound-guided myometrial injection of radiotracer (TUMIR)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with transvaginal ultrasound-guided myometrial injection of radiotracer (TUMIR) to detect lymph node (LN) metastases, in patients with intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer (EC), focusing on its performance to detect paraaortic involvement.Methods: Prospective study including women with preoperative intermediate or high-risk EC, according to ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO consensus, who underwent SLN mapping using the TUMIR approach. SLNs were preoperatively localized by planar and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography images, and intraoperatively by gamma-probe. Immediately after SLN excision, all women underwent systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy by laparoscopy.Results: The study included 102 patients. The intraoperative SLN detection rate was 79.4% (81/102). Pelvic and paraaortic drainage was observed in 92.6% (75/81) and 45.7% (37/81) women, respectively, being exclusively paraaortic in 7.4% (6/81). After systematic lymphadenectomy, LN metastases were identified in 19.6% (20/102) patients, with 45.0% (9/20) showing paraaortic involvement, which was exclusive in 15.0% (3/20). The overall sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLNs by the TUMIR approach to detect lymphatic involvement were 87.5% and 97.0%, respectively; and 83.3% and 96.9%, for paraaortic metastases. After applying the MSKCC SLN mapping algorithm, the sensitivity and NPV were 93.8% and 98.5%, respectively.Conclusion: The TUMIR method provides valuable information of endometrial drainage in patients at higher risk of paraaortic LN involvement. The TUMIR approach showed a detection rate of paraaortic SLNs greater than 45% and a high sensitivity and NPV for paraaortic metastases in women with intermediate and high-risk EC.

T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the varying trends of dust storm frequency in a typical oasis located at the South edge of Taklimakan desert, China were analyzed by using time series analysis and regression models. The LUCC (land use/cover change) data, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) remote sensing data, meteorological data and dust storm frequency data for the period of 2004-2018 were collected from local station and ERDAS (Earth Resources Data Analysis System) software, the multivariate relationships between human activities, natural factor and dust storm frequencies were analyzed by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results indicated that the annual dust storm frequency in the study period increased with fluctuation. The monthly dust storm frequency shows higher values between the months of March and June, which accounts for 72.3% of the annual dust storm frequency. Precipitation and wind speed are two meteorological factors which can impact the dust storm formation and its frequency. The correlation between dust storm frequency and temperature was insignificant. Moreover, human activities indirectly affected the dynamics of dust storms by changing the vegetation cover and direct dust emissions. Furthermore, multivariate analysis highlighted a clear relationship among dust storm frequency, meteorological factors and NDVI. The high loadings of dust storm frequency, precipitation, wind speed and NDVI on a PC indicated that increase in precipitation and NDVI will decline dust storm frequency, whereas higher wind speed will enhance dust storm frequency. The findings of this study could be useful to understand the possible causes of dust storms, which can provide the basis for controlling the dust storm source region and also mitigation of the negative effects dust storm on the environment.

In order to carry out the work, the years 2015 and 2019 were selected, and the Landsat-8 Satellite images were downloaded to use some Geographic Information Systems (GIS) algorithms and tools, resulting in thematic maps for the evaluation. of the studied parameters. Resulting an NDVI with maximum values of 0.35 and minimum of 0.116. Meanwhile, the TST showed a maximum value of 47 degrees C that occurred in areas of exposed soil, and a minimum value of 28 degrees C in regions of greater NDVI. The most distant districts of the Center had a higher TST, as they showed less vegetative vigor. These results contributed to the understanding of the occurrence of these phenomena, and to future actions aimed at improving thermal comfort in the city.

TI  - Building a Reliable Health Care System A Lean Six Sigma Quality Improvement Initiative on Patient Handoff
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING CARE QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:There is limited evidence available identifying best practices to promote and sustain optimal outpatient-to-inpatient handoff processes to ensure safe and reliable continuity of care.Local Problem:A sentinel event occurred during the transition of care from the outpatient-to-inpatient setting. A root cause analysis revealed that the facility's standard operating procedure for patient handoffs was not consistently followed.Methods:A Lean Six Sigma approach was used to improve patient transfer with the implementation of a Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation handoff policy. Inferential and statistical process control methods were used to assess performance outcomes pre- and postdissemination.Results:Over 36 months there was a slow, steady decrease in patient transfer time including reduced variability. The most significant improvement effect occurred in the third year with a 50% reduction in transfer time.Conclusions:Longitudinal monitoring provides the opportunity to accurately identify beneficial outcomes, which develop downstream from initial quality improvement efforts.

TI  - Effect of Aerosols, Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> and Clouds on Surface Solar Radiation over the Eastern Mediterranean (Greece)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the effect that two basic air quality indexes, aerosols and tropospheric NO2, exert on surface solar radiation (SSR) is studied, along with the effect of liquid and ice clouds over 16 locations in Greece, in the heart of the Eastern Mediterranean. State-of-the-art satellite-based observations and climatological data for the 15-year period 2005-2019, and a radiative transfer system based on a modified version of the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model are used. Our SSR simulations are in good agreement with ground observations and two satellite products. It is shown that liquid clouds dominate, with an annual radiative effect (RE) of -36 W/m(2), with ice clouds (-19 W/m(2)) and aerosols (-13 W/m(2)) following. The radiative effect of tropospheric NO2 is smaller by two orders of magnitude (-0.074 W/m(2)). Under clear skies, REaer is about 3-4 times larger than for liquid and ice cloud-covered skies, while RENO2 doubles. The radiative effect of all the parameters exhibits a distinct seasonal cycle. An increase in SSR is observed for the period 2005-2019 (positive trends ranging from 0.01 to 0.52 W/m(2)/year), which is mostly related to a decrease in the aerosol optical depth and the liquid cloud fraction.

TI  - Surface water extent dynamics from three periods of continuous Landsat time series; subregional differences across Argentine plains
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pampean region in Argentina is an extensive plain characterized by abundant shallow lakes that fulfill many environmental, ecological, and social functions. This study aims to detect the multiannual lake area changes in this region during 2001-2009 using remote sensing, including lakes as small as >= 10,000 m(2) or 1 ha. Landsat scenes of the wet (2008-2009), normal (2006), and dry (2008-2009) seasons were obtained, and using remote sensing techniques, the number and area of shallow lakes were calculated. The spatiotemporal variation of shallow lakes was studied in different climate periods in eight singular subregions. Spatial associations between annual precipitation and lake number and area were analyzed through the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) at a subregional scale. During the study period the total lake area in the Pampean region decreased by 5257.39 km(2) (62 %), but each subregion showed different responses to climatic events. In seven of them, the differences between climate periods prove to be statistically significant (P>0.01). The relationship between precipitation and lake number and area revealed the domain of positive association. We conclude that climate factors play a dominant role in lake changes across the Pampean plains. However, other factors such as origin, topographic and edaphic characteristics intensify or mitigate changes in surface hydrology.

TI  - A prospective comparative study of locoregional recurrence rate after oncoplastic breast surgery versus wide local excision of breast carcinoma
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer is the commonest cancer in Egypt in women. There are about 39% of total malignancies in Egyptian females and it is a leading cause of mortality among them.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to compare locoregional recurrence rate after oncoplastic breast surgery versus wide local excision of breast carcinoma.Patients and methodsThis prospective study was conducted at Ain Shams University Hospitals on 50 patients, -25 of them underwent oncoplastic breast surgery and -25 underwent wide local excision, as a part of the treatment of breast cancer, to compare the rate of a breast cancer recurrence over 1.6 years starting from December 2018. Approval of the Ethical Committee and written informed consent from all participants were obtained.ResultsOur study included 50 patients, 25 of them underwent wide local excision for stages 1 and 2 breast cancer, the other 25 underwent oncoplastic breast surgery for stages 1 and 2 breast cancer. Our mean age was 44.24 +/- 8.13 years (28-60 years). In total, nine (18.0%) had a positive family history of mammary cancer, five (10.0%) patients were diabetic, three (6.0%) patients were hypertensive, the mean size of the tumor was 3.54 +/- 1.16 (1-5) cm. Grades of the tumor were grade 1 32 (64.0%), grade 2 11 (22.0%), and grade 3 7 (14.0%); sentinel lymph node biopsy was done in six (12.0%) of patients; there is a high correlation between the closest free margin and the technique of surgery used where 96% of cases undergoing oncoplastic breast conservation surgery had the closest free margin more than 2 cm in comparison to 24% of cases undergoing wide local excision. Regarding recurrence rate, although there are two cases of locoregional recurrence that occurred after wide local excision versus no recurrence in the oncoplastic breast conservation surgery group, this has been of no statistical significance. There is a significant relation between diabetes mellitus and cosmetic outcome, where 20% of diabetic patients have poor cosmetic outcome and 90% of patients with the excellent cosmetic outcome have no comorbidities.ConclusionOn short-term follow-up done in our study of 1.5 years, there is no significant difference in the recurrence rate of stages 1 and 2 breast cancer after wide local excision and oncoplastic breast surgery, but there has been a significant increase in the size of the closest free margin in oncoplastic breast surgery compared with wide local excision.

TI  - Performance of the Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Sentinel Surveillance System in Yemen: Mixed Methods Evaluation Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The national severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance system in Yemen was established in 2010 to monitor SARI occurrence in humans and provide a foundation for detecting SARI outbreaks.Objective: To ensure that the objectives of national surveillance are being met, this study aimed to examine the level of usefulness and the performance of the SARI surveillance system in Yemen.Methods: The updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were used for the purposes of our evaluation. Related documents and reports were reviewed. Data were collected from 4 central-level managers and stakeholders and from 10 focal points at 4 sentinel sites by using a semistmctured questionnaire For each attribute, percent scores were calculated and ranked as follows: very poor (<= 20%), poor (20%-40%), average (40%-60%), good (60%-80%), and excellent (>80%).Results: As rated by the evaluators, the SARI surveillance system achieved its objectives. The system's flexibility (percent score: 86%) and acceptability (percent score: 82%) were rated as "excellent," and simplicity (percent score: 74%) and stability (percent score: 75%) were rated as "good." The percent score for timeliness was 23% in 2018, which indicated poor timeliness. The overall data quality percent score of the SARI system was 98.5%. Despite its many strengths, the SARI system has some weaknesses. For example, it depends on irregular external financial support.Conclusions: The SARI surveillance system was useful in estimating morbidity and mortality, monitoring the trends of the disease, and promoting research for informing prevention and control measures. The overall performance of the SARI surveillance system was good. We recommend expanding the system by promoting private health facilities' (eg, private hospitals and private health centers) engagement in SARI surveillance, establishing an electronic database at central and peripheral sites, and providing the National Central Public Health Laboratory with the reagents needed for disease confirmation.

TI  - The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission River Database (SWORD): A Global River Network for Satellite Data Products
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, planned to launch in 2022, is the first mission to focus on measuring hydrological processes in Earth's surface water. As such, SWOT will vastly expand observations of global rivers >= 100 m wide. SWOT will provide a variety of data products, including a global vector river product containing water surface elevation (WSE), width, slope, and estimated discharge. Practical application and consistency of the SWOT vector products requires a prior global river network database divided into reaches. Here, we introduce the SWOT River Database (SWORD). SWORD will serve as the framework for the SWOT river vector products consisting of river reaches (similar to 10 km long) and nodes (similar to 200 m spacing). We generate SWORD by combining several global river- and satellite-related data sets into one congruent product. When defining river reaches, we incorporate natural and human-created river obstructions, basin boundaries, tributary junctions, and SWOT orbit track information. SWORD contains a total of 213,485 reaches and 10.7 million nodes. Globally, 77.3% of river reach lengths are between 10 and 20 km with a median reach length of 10.5 km. 95% of river reaches >= 10 km will have sufficient SWOT observations to provide discharge estimates at least once per orbit cycle. SWORD also contains many useful hydrologic and morphological attributes and is designed to be expandable in the future. Even before the launch of SWOT, it can serve as a framework for global hydrologic analyses using models, in situ measurements, and additional satellite observations.

TI  - Atypical ductal hyperplasia of the breast mimics breast cancer presentation treated surgically: a case report and literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is considered a benign lesion with increased malignant potential. ADH represents similar to 3% of total benign breast biopsy results. A 60-year-old woman with no family history of breast cancer presented with multiple painless lumps in the right breast and palpable right axillary lymph nodes. Ultrasonography and mammography showed typical features of breast cancer. However, core needle biopsy revealed ADH without infiltrating malignancy. Based on a multidisciplinary decision, a right simple mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was chosen as the best treatment plan. The postoperative histopathology report showed the spread of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in all quadrants without any evidence of invasive cancer. It is challenging to obtain an accurate diagnosis of clinically palpable and multicentric ADH or DCIS based on preoperative radiological and histological evaluation, especially when dissonance between these two evaluation modalities exists.

TI  - Modeling photosynthetically active radiation: A review
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Review
AB  - Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is important in applications related to plant physiology or the carbon cycle. However, despite its importance, a global network for its measurement has not yet been established. This work consists of the revision of a series of works related to the development of empirical models for the estimation of PAR in places where it is not regularly measured, using for this purpose measurements of meteorological and radiation parameters available in weather stations. A list of the models developed, the study site, the results obtained, and the nomenclature used in each of them is made. The most common way to develop empirical estimation models is by studying spatio-temporal changes in the relationship between PAR and global solar radiation. Other estimation methods include the use of satellite-derived products such as MODIS-derived products and the use of artificial neural networks. Despite being more efficient for estimating PAR, the use of artificial neural networks is not as widespread because its use is more complex than the development of empirical models. The PAR to global solar radiation ratio reached its maximum in the summer months and the minimum in the winter months; in addition, the daily values per hour reached their maximum at sunrise and sunset, and their minimum around noon.

TI  - <i>Salmonella</i> Bloodstream Infections in Hospitalized Children with Acute Febrile Illness-Uganda, 2016-2019
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive Salmonella infection is a common cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) among children in subSaharan Africa; however, diagnosing Salmonella bacteremia is challenging in settings without blood culture. The Uganda AFI surveillance system includes blood culture-based surveillance for etiologies of bloodstream infection (BSIs) in hospitalized febrile children in Uganda. We analyzed demographic, clinical, blood culture, and antimicrobial resistance data from hospitalized children at six sentinel AFI sites from July 2016 to January 2019. A total of 47,261 children were hospitalized. Median age was 2 years (interquartile range, 1-4) and 26,695 (57%) were male. Of 7,203 blood cultures, 242 (3%) yielded bacterial pathogens including Salmonella (N = 67, 28%), Staphylococcus aureus (N = 40, 17%), Escherichia spp. (N = 25, 10%), Enterococcus spp. (N = 18, 7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 17, 7%). Children with BSIs had longer median length of hospitalization (5 days versus 4 days), and a higher case-fatality ratio (13% versus 2%) than children without BSI (all P < 0.001). Children with Salmonella BSIs did not differ significantly in length of hospitalization or mortality from children with BSI resulting from other organisms. Serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility results were available for 49 Salmonella isolates, including 35 (71%) non-typhoidal serotypes and 14 Salmonella serotype Typhi (Typhi). Among Typhi isolates, 10 (71%) were multi-drug resistant and 13 (93%) had decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Salmonella strains, particularly non-typhoidal serotypes and drug-resistant Typhi, were the most common cause of BSI. These data can inform regional Salmonella surveillance in East Africa and guide empiric therapy and prevention in Uganda.

TI  - Improvement of a Dasymetric Method for Implementing Sustainable Development Goal 11 Indicators at an Intra-Urban Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local and Regional Authorities require indicators at the intra-urban scale to design adequate policies to foster the achievement of the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11. Updated high-resolution population density and settlement maps are the basic input products for such indicators and their sub-indicators. When provided at the intra-urban scale, these essential variables can facilitate the extraction of population flows, including both local and regular migrant components. This paper discusses a modification of the dasymetric method implemented in our previous work, aimed at improving the population density estimation. The novelties of our paper include the introduction of building height information and site-specific weight values for population density correction. Based on the proposed improvements, selected indicators/sub-indicators of four SDG 11 targets were updated or newly implemented. The output density map error values are provided in terms of the mean absolute error, root mean square error and mean absolute percentage indicators. The values obtained (i.e., 2.3 and 4.1 people, and 8.6%, respectively) were lower than those of the previous dasymetric method. The findings suggest that the new methodology can provide updated information about population fluxes and processes occurring over the period 2011-2020 in the study site-Bari city in southern Italy.

AB  - This research measured land use changes in the Andean paramo of Venezuela using a multitemporal analysis of the indicator 'vegetal coverage affected of Andean Paramo. Landsat 7 satellite images from 2006 and 2012, and Landsat 8 satellite image from 2016 has been used for the Rangel municipality of Merida state. Information regarding this indicator as part of a management system (IMS), comes from an Action Plan for the Conservation of the Venezuelan Andean Paramo. A decrease of 538.69 ha of Andean paramo surface, has been found as a consequence of interventions activities between years 2006 and 2016. At the same time, a decrease of 426.08 ha of Andean Paramo surface was identified and it was replaced by the attitudinal advance of Andean forest surface on wet slopes, due to climate change.

TI  - VALIDATION OF SOIL USES AROUND RESERVOIRS IN THE SEMI-ARID THROUGH IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The work evaluated the potential for discrimination of land use and occupation around reservoirs, using spectral information obtained by multispectral, hyperspectral satellites and images obtained with an ARP (remotely piloted aircraft). The research analyzed the performance of different images classification techniques applied to multispectral and hyperspectral sensors for the detection and differentiation of soil classes around the Paus Brancos and Marengo reservoirs, located in Settlement 25 of Maio. The classes identified based on surveys in campaigns carried out in 2014 and 2015 around the reservoirs were: water, macrophytes, exposed soil, native vegetation, agriculture, thin and ebbing vegetation, in addition to the cloud and cloud shadow targets. The performance of the classifiers applied to the image of the Hyperion sensor was, in general, superior to those obtained in Landsat 8 image, which can be explained by the high spectral resolution of the first, which facilitates the differentiation of targets with similar spectral response. For validation of the supervised classification method of Maximum Likelihood, Landsat 8 (08/24/2015) and Hyperion (08/28/2015) images were used. The results of the application indicated a good performance of the classifier associated with the RGB composition of the chosen Hyperion image (bands R - 51, G - 161, B - 19) in the detection of the classes around this reservoir, producing a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The availability of data from the Hyperion sensor is very restricted, which hinders the development of continued research, thus the use of images surpassed by RPA is extremely viable.

TI  - A Colourimetric Approach to Ecological Remote Sensing: Case Study for the Rainforests of South-Eastern Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To facilitate the simplification, visualisation and communicability of satellite imagery classifications, this study applied visual analytics to validate a colourimetric approach via the direct and scalable measurement of hue angle from enhanced false colour band ratio RGB composites. A holistic visual analysis of the landscape was formalised by creating and applying an ontological image interpretation key from an ecological-colourimetric deduction for rainforests within the variegated landscapes of south-eastern Australia. A workflow based on simple one-class, one-index density slicing was developed to implement this deductive approach to mapping using freely available Sentinel-2 imagery and the super computing power from Google Earth Engine for general public use. A comprehensive accuracy assessment based on existing field observations showed that the hue from a new false colour blend combining two band ratio RGBs provided the best overall results, producing a 15 m classification with an overall average accuracy of 79%. Additionally, a new index based on a band ratio subtraction performed better than any existing vegetation index typically used for tropical evergreen forests with comparable results to the false colour blend. The results emphasise the importance of the SWIR1 band in discriminating rainforests from other vegetation types. While traditional vegetation indices focus on productivity, colourimetric measurement offers versatile multivariate indicators that can encapsulate properties such as greenness, wetness and brightness as physiognomic indicators. The results confirmed the potential for the large-scale, high-resolution mapping of broadly defined vegetation types.

TI  - Total Surface Current Vector and Shear From a Sequence of Satellite Images: Effect of Waves in Opposite Directions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The total surface current velocity (TSCV)-the horizontal vector quantity that advects seawater-is an essential climate variable, with few observations available today. The TSCV can be derived from the phase speed of surface gravity waves, and the estimates of the phase speeds of different wavelengths could give a measure of the vertical shear. Here, we combine 10-m resolution Level-1C of the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, acquired with time lags up to 1 s, and numerical simulation of these images. Retrieving the near-surface shear requires a specific attention to waves in opposing directions when estimating a single-phase speed from the phase difference in an image pair. Opposing waves lead to errors in phase speeds that are most frequent for shorter wavelengths. We propose an alternative method using a least squares fit of the current speed and amplitudes of waves in opposing directions to the observed complex amplitudes of a sequence of three images. When applied to Sentinel-2, this method generally provides more noisy estimate of the current. A byproduct of this analysis is the "opposition spectrum" which is a key quantity in the sources of microseisms and microbaroms. For future possible sensors, the retrieval of TSCV and shear can benefit from increased time lags, resolution, and exposure time of acquisition. These findings should allow new investigations of near-surface ocean processes including regions of freshwater influence or internal waves, using existing satellite missions such as Sentinel-2, and provide a basis for the design of future optical instruments.

TI  - Non-Binary Snow Index for Multi-Component Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Non-Binary Snow Index for Multi-Component Surfaces (NBSI-MS) is proposed to map snow/ice cover. The NBSI-MS is based on the spectral characteristics of different Land Cover Types (LCTs), such as snow, water, vegetation, bare land, impervious, and shadow surfaces. This index can increase the separability between NBSI-MS values corresponding to snow from other LCTs and accurately delineate the snow/ice cover in non-binary maps. To test the robustness of the NBSI-MS, regions in Greenland and France-Italy where snow interacts with highly diversified geographical ecosystems were examined. Data recorded by Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2A MSI satellites were used. The NBSI-MS performance was also compared against the well-known Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), NDSII-1, S3, and Snow Water Index (SWI) methods and evaluated based on Ground Reference Test Pixels (GRTPs) over non-binarized results. The results show that the NBSI-MS achieved an overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 0.99 to 1 with kappa coefficient values in the same range as the OA. The precision assessment confirmed the performance superiority of the proposed NBSI-MS method for removing water and shadow surfaces over the compared relevant indices.

TI  - The materiality of the <i>letter</i> in Seto oral culture
T2  - MULTILINGUA-JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL AND INTERLANGUAGE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the concept of letter in oral folklore. The main research material is examples from the older folk songs of Seto, where a letter, a book and other items referring to literacy are mentioned. Texts under consideration are poetical and the meaning conveyed in them is not always very clear. The term letter may be related to a message, paper, book, leaf or other material medium in the songs. The boundary between oracy and literacy is therefore thin, given that letters and writing are often imagined and conveyed in a physical context. Literacy in Seto folk songs is sometimes reflected as part of mythological knowledge and a mythological worldview. The written text or objects carrying it may have magical power. In some songs the writing can also be found on plants, which is interesting from a cross-cultural perspective. Similar motives from the folklore and beliefs of other peoples have been used comparatively to understand the content of the songs under consideration. The song of heavenly cows eating holy plants offers an opportunity to draw intercultural parallels and raises the question about the ethnogenesis of the Seto and their relatedness to different Eurasian peoples further to the east.

TI  - Mangrove mapping using Sentinel-1 data for improved decision support on sustainable conservation and restoration interventions in the Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar Site, Ghana
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the conservation importance of the Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar Site (KLCRS), obtaining information on the extent and distribution of mangroves is challenging due to the unavailability of optical satellite data. This research explored Sentinel-1 radar data to provide information on mangrove distribution in the KLCRS. Global positioning system points from 443 training and 196 validation sites were used. In addition, focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to corroborate information on mangrove distribution. Sentinel-1 data were processed for backscatter coefficients and two backscatter derivatives. These were stacked into a four-layer image composite and classified using a support vector machine. An overall classification accuracy of 89.28% was obtained. In addition, user and producer accuracies of 100 and 97.3% respectively were obtained for the mangrove class. The results show that mangroves occupy a total area of 41.02 km(2) in the KLCRS and are mostly found around the Salo, Bomigo, Anyanui and Dzita communities. This study demonstrates the possibility of using Sentinel-1 imagery to map mangroves within the KLCRS. Thus, this study serves as a guideline for other data-constrained mangrove landscapes to map and monitor mangroves for conservation and restoration actions.

TI  - Observation of Cloud Base Height and Precipitation Characteristics at a Polar Site Ny-Alesund, Svalbard Using Ground-Based Remote Sensing and Model Reanalysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a significant role in regulating the Arctic climate and water cycle due to their impacts on radiative balance through various complex feedback processes. However, there are still large discrepancies in satellite and numerical model-derived cloud datasets over the Arctic region due to a lack of observations. Here, we report observations of cloud base height (CBH) characteristics measured using a Vaisala CL51 ceilometer at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard. The study highlights the monthly and seasonal CBH characteristics at the location. It is found that almost 40% of the lowest CBHs fall within a height range of 0.5-1 km. The second and third cloud bases that could be detected by the ceilometer are mostly concentrated below 3 km during summer but possess more vertical spread during the winter season. Thin and low-level clouds appear to be dominant during the summer. Low-level clouds are found to be dominant and observed in 76% of cases. The mid and high-level clouds occur in similar to 16% and similar to 7% of cases, respectively. Further, micro rain radar (MRR2) observed enhanced precipitation and snowfall events during the winter and spring which are found to be associated with the lowest CBHs within 2 km from the ground. The frontal process associated with synoptic-scale meteorological conditions explains the variabilities in CBH and precipitation at the observation site when compared for two contrasting winter precipitation events. The findings of the study could be useful for model evaluation of cloud precipitation relationships and satellite data validation in the Arctic environment.

TI  - When is it worth performing lymphadenectomy in patients with melanoma micrometastases? A 20-year experience retrospective analysis
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The benefits of complete lymph node dissection (CLND) in melanoma patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) have been recently questioned. Sentinel node (SN) tumor burden > 1 mm has been proposed as the most reliable parameter associated with positive CLND and poorer disease-free survival. Material and methods: Between June 1997 and June 2017, data from 119 melanoma patients with positive SLNB were analyzed. Patients were classified by SN burden in two groups: <= 1 mm and > 1 mm. Results: CLND was positive in 6 (10%) patients with SN tumor burden <= 1 mm and in 23 (37.7%) patients with > 1 mm (p < 0.001). In univariable analysis, SN tumor burden was the only predictive factor of positive CLND (OR 5.24 [1.94-14.13]). In multivariable analysis, SN tumor burden was the only independent factor of melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Conclusion: Although CLND should still be considered individually in patients with positive SLNB, SN tumor burden >1 mm might be a good predictive factor of additional positive non-sentinel nodes and a strong independent prognostic factor in melanoma-specific survival.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the patterns of land-use and land-cover changes for the last three decades (1986-2017) and its drivers for Owabi and Barekese watersheds in the moist semi-deciduous forest of Ghana. The study used Landsat satellite imageries of 1986, 1998, 2007, and 2017 and population data to analyze land cover and use changes of the two watersheds. A decline in natural vegetation cover by 57% and 71.3% has occurred for Owabi and Barekese watersheds respectively. Cropland increased by 77.1% and 105.2% while settlement has increased by 1,018% and 4%, respectively, for Owabi and Barekese watersheds. Cropland is the main form of land-use change for Barekese watershed while settlement is the main land-use change in the Owabi watershed. Annual expansion of settlement within the Owabi site was 38.1%, and cropland was 5.2% for the Barekese site. Population trends had a significant negative relationship with forest cover and a positive relationship with settlement and cropland. Catchment degradation was also influenced by the management model used.

TI  - Analysis of the Deformation Behavior and Sinkhole Risk in Kerdabad, Iran Using the PS-InSAR Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unexpected collapse of land surface due to subsidence is one of the most significant geohazards that threatens human life and infrastructure. Kabudrahang and Famenin are two Iranian plains experiencing several sinkholes due to the characteristics of the underground soil layers and extreme groundwater depletion. In this study, space-based Synthetic Aperture Radar images are used to investigate the ground displacement behavior to examine the feasibility of Sentinel-1 data in detecting precursory deformation proceeding before the sinkhole formation. The selected sinkhole occurred in August 2018 in the vicinity of Kerdabad village in Hamedan province with a 40 m diameter and depth of similar to 40 m. Time series of the European constellation Sentinel-1 data, spanning from January 2015 to August 2018, is analyzed, and the results revealed a 3 cm annual subsidence (similar to 3 cm/year) along with the line-of-sight direction. Time-series analysis demonstrated that the driving mechanism of the sinkhole formation had a gradual process. Displacement of persistent scatterers (PSs) near the cave area had an acceleration by approaching the sinkhole formation date. In contrast, other areas that are far from the cave area show linear subsidence behavior over time. Additionally, the one-kilometer deformation profile over the cave area indicates a high subsidence rate precisely at the location where the sinkhole was formed later on 20 August 2018.

TI  - Modified Linear Scaling and Quantile Mapping Mean Bias Correction of MODIS Land Surface Temperature for Surface Air Temperature Estimation for the Lowland Areas of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS land surface temperature data (MODIS T-s) products are quantified from the earth surface's reflected thermal infrared signal via sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. MODIS T-s products are a great value to many environmental applications but often subject to discrepancies when compared to the air temperature (T-a) data that represent the temperature measured at 2 m above the ground surface. Although they are different in their nature, the relationship between T-s and T-a has been established by many researchers. Further validation and correction on the relationship between these two has enabled the estimation of T-a from MODIS T-s products in order to overcome the limitation of T-a that can only provide data in a point form with a very limited area coverage. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objective to assess the accuracy of MODIS T-s products, i.e., MOD11A1, MOD11A2, MYD11A1, and MYD11A2 against T-a and to identify the performance of a modified Linear Scaling using a constant and monthly correction factor (LS-MBC), and Quantile Mapping Mean Bias Correction (QM-MBC) methods for lowland area of Peninsular Malaysia. Furthermore, the correction factor (CF) values for each MBC were adjusted according to the condition set depending on the different bias levels. Then, the performance of the pre- and post-MBC correction for by stations and regions analysis were evaluated through root mean square error (RMSE), percentage bias (PBIAS), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r). The region dataset is obtained by stacking the air temperature (T-a_r) and surface temperature (T-s_r) data corresponding to the number of stations within the identified regions. The assessment of pre-MBC data for both 36 stations and 5 regions demonstrated poor correspondence with high average errors and percentage biases, i.e., RMSE = 3.33-5.42 degrees C, PBIAS = 1.36-12.07%, MAE = 2.88-4.89 degrees C, and r = 0.16-0.29. The application of the MBCs has successfully reduced the errors and bias percentages, and slightly increased the r values for all MODIS T-s products. All post-MBC depicted good average accuracies (RMSE and MAE < 3 degrees C and PBIAS between +/- 5%) and r between 0.18 and 0.31. In detail, for the station analysis, the LS-MBC using monthly CF recorded better performance than the LS-MBC using constant CF or the QM-MBC. For the regional study, the QM-MBC outperformed the others. This study illustrated that the proposed LS-MBC, in spite of its simplicity, managed to perform well in reducing the error and bias terms of MODIS T-s as much as the performance of the more complex QM-MBC method.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Estimation of Crop Biophysical Parameters Using Multi-Source and Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are considered as one of the primary data sources for precise agriculture. Several studies have demonstrated the excellent capability of radar and optical imagery for crop mapping and biophysical parameter estimation. This paper aims at modeling the crop biophysical parameters, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass, using a combination of radar and optical Earth observations. We extracted several radar features from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Vegetation Indices (VIs) from optical images to model crops' LAI and dry biomass. Then, the mutual correlations between these features and Random Forest feature importance were calculated. We considered two scenarios to estimate crop parameters. First, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized to estimate two crop biophysical parameters. To this end, crops' dry biomass and LAI were estimated using three input data; (1) SAR polarimetric features; (2) spectral VIs; (3) integrating both SAR and optical features. Second, a deep artificial neural network was created. These input data were fed to the mentioned algorithms and evaluated using the in-situ measurements. These observations of three cash crops, including soybean, corn, and canola, have been collected over Manitoba, Canada, during the Soil Moisture Active Validation Experimental 2012 (SMAPVEX-12) campaign. The results showed that GB and XGB have great potential in parameter estimation and remarkably improved accuracy. Our results also demonstrated a significant improvement in the dry biomass and LAI estimation compared to the previous studies. For LAI, the validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reported as 0.557 m(2)/m(2) for canola using GB, and 0.298 m(2)/m(2) for corn using GB, 0.233 m(2)/m(2) for soybean using XGB. RMSE was reported for dry biomass as 26.29 g/m(2) for canola utilizing SVR, 57.97 g/m(2) for corn using RF, and 5.00 g/m(2) for soybean using GB. The results revealed that the deep artificial neural network had a better potential to estimate crop parameters than the ML algorithms.

TI  - An improved distributed scatterers extraction algorithm for monitoring tattered ground surface subsidence with DSInSAR: A case study of loess landform in Tongren county
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to effectively detect the detailed subsidence of tattered ground surface composed of many small fragments with the distributed scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DSInSAR) technique, a fast and accurate distributed scatterer extraction (FADSE), as an improved distributed scatterers extraction algorithm, is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. The emphasis of FADSE is on the improvement of accuracy of extracted DSs and detection efficiency as well. For the purpose, nonparametric estimation and parametric estimation methods are combined into FADSE to fast identify as many accurate statistically homogeneous pixels (SHP) as possible. Then the thresholds of homogeneous pixel number and coherence coefficient are adjusted to select DSs from SHPs. The validation of FADSE was performed in the case of loess subsidence detection in Tongren county, Qinghai Province of China, using 20 Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired between February 2016 and June 2017. Moreover, FADSE was compared with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov algorithm and Fast Statistically Homogeneous Pixel Selection method. Results show that FADSE is capable of efficiently extracting more DSs that are accurate and the detailed subsidence of tattered ground surface can be accurately detected.

TI  - Monitoring and Modeling the Patterns and Trends of Urban Growth Using Urban Sprawl Matrix and CA-Markov Model: A Case Study of Karachi, Pakistan
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial growth of cities is crucial for proactive planning and sustainable urbanization. The largest and most densely inhabited megapolis of Pakistan, Karachi, has experienced massive spatial growth not only in the core areas of the city, but also in the city's suburbs and outskirts over the past decades. In this study, the land use/land cover (LULC) in Karachi was classified using Landsat data and the random forest algorithm from the Google Earth Engine cloud platform for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Land use/land cover classification maps as well as an urban sprawl matrix technique were used to analyze the geographical patterns and trends of urban sprawl. Six urban classes, namely, the primary urban core, secondary urban core, sub-urban fringe, scatter settlement, urban open space, and non-urban area, were determined for the exploration of urban landscape changes. Future scenarios of LULC for 2030 were predicted using a CA-Markov model. The study found that the built-up area had expanded in a considerably unpredictable manner, primarily at the expense of agricultural land. The increase in mangroves and grassland and shrub land proved the effectiveness of afforestation programs in improving vegetation coverage in the study area. The investigation of urban landscape alteration revealed that the primary urban core expanded from the core districts, namely, the Central, South, and East districts, and a new urban secondary core emerged in Malir in 2020. The CA-Markov model showed that the total urban built-up area could potentially increase from 584.78 km(2) in 2020 to 652.59 km(2) in 2030. The integrated method combining remote sensing, GIS, and an urban sprawl matrix has proven invaluable for the investigation of urban sprawl in a rapidly growing city.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Changes in the Tlemcen Region (Algeria) and Classification of Fragile Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tlemcen region is characterized by very diverse and steep areas exposed to gravity hazards, especially in high and medium mountain areas. Tlemcen National Park was chosen for this study, the main objective of which is to map fragile areas in close relation to reduced vegetation cover due to land-use changes and forest fires. Multi-source data were used to monitor land use/land cover (LULC)patterns in the study area between 1987 and 2017. The methodology is based on an object-oriented classification of the Landsat images, using the K nearest neighbor method for mapping the major LULC classes at the national park level. The results show that LULC is constantly changing in the study area. In 1987, the landscape was made up of (16.5%) oak forests (holm oak, cork oak, zean oak) and Aleppo pine, which then deteriorated following repeated fires in the nineties to barely represent 7.22% of the surface in 1995, followed by a fast forest reclamation, with the forest area doubling in 10 years (13.46% of the area in 2005), and a near stabilization of the forest cover in 2017 with 14.68% of the area. These mutations are mainly due to fluctuations in anthropogenic action. Despite past declines and disturbances, the current forested area in the Tlemcen area represents significant forest capital classified as a national park to be protected and developed.

TI  - Does Planck actually "see" the Bunch-Davies state?
T2  - JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To what extent can the Planck satellite observations be interpreted as confirmation of the quantum part of the inflationary paradigm? Has it "seen" the Bunch-Davies state? We compare and contrast the Bunch-Davies interpretation with one using a so-called entangled state in which the fluctuations of a spectator scalar field are entangled with those of the metric perturbations zeta. We first show how a spectator scalar field Sigma, with an expectation value sigma(t) that evolves in time, will generically generate such a state. We then use this state to compute the power spectrum P-zeta(k) and thence the temperature anisotropies C-l in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We find interesting differences from the standard calculations using the Bunch-Davies (BD) state. We argue that existing data may already be used to place interesting bounds on this class of deviations from the BD state and that, for some values of the parameters of the state, the power spectra may be consistent with the Planck satellite data.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Vertical and Horizontal Deformations Derived by 3D and 2D Decompositions of InSAR Line-of-Sight Measurements to Supplement Industry Surveillance Programs in the Tengiz Oilfield (Kazakhstan)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research focused on the quantitative assessment of the surface deformation velocities and rates and their natural and man-made controlling factors at Tengiz Oilfield in Kazakhstan using the Small Baseline Subset remote sensing technique followed by 3D and 2D decompositions and cosine corrections to derive vertical and horizontal movements from line-of-sight (LOS) measurements. In the present research we applied time-series of Sentinel-1 satellite images acquired during 2018-2020. All ground deformation derivatives showed the continuous subsidence at the Tengiz oilfield with increasing velocity. 3D and 2D decompositions of LOS measurements to vertical movement showed that the Tengiz Oil Field 2018-2020 continuously subsided with the maximum annual vertical deformation velocity around 70 mm. Based on the LOS measurements, the maximum annual subsiding velocity was observed to be 60 mm. Cosine corrections of LOS measurements to vertical movement, however, revealed a maximum annual vertical deformation velocity of 77 mm. The vertical deformation confirmed typical patterns of subsidence caused by oil extraction. Detected east-west and north-south horizontal movements at the Tengiz field clearly indicated that the study area crossed by seismic faults is affected by natural tectonic processes. The overall RMSE of 3D decomposed vertical deformation in relationship to LOS measurements and cosine corrections were in the range of 10-13 mm and 6-8 mm, correspondingly. The results of the present research will support operators of oil and gas fields and also other types of infrastructure to evaluate the actual differences of InSAR ground deformation measurements against the required standards and the precision of measurements depending on the operational needs, timeframes and availability of radar imagery.

TI  - An Operational Framework for Mapping Irrigated Areas at Plot Scale Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present an operational methodology for mapping irrigated areas at plot scale, which overcomes the limitation of terrain data availability, using Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical time series. The method was performed over a study site located near Orleans city of north-central France for four years (2017 until 2020). First, training data of irrigated and non-irrigated plots were selected using predefined selection criteria to obtain sufficient samples of irrigated and non-irrigated plots each year. The training data selection criteria is based on two irrigation metrics; the first one is a SAR-based metric derived from the S1 time series and the second is an optical-based metric derived from the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time series of the S2 data. Using the newly developed irrigation event detection model (IEDM) applied for all S1 time series in VV (Vertical-Vertical) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarizations, an irrigation weight metric was calculated for each plot. Using the NDVI time series, the maximum NDVI value achieved in the crop cycle was considered as a second selection metric. By fixing threshold values for both metrics, a dataset of irrigated and non-irrigated samples was constructed each year. Later, a random forest classifier (RF) was built for each year in order to map the summer agricultural plots into irrigated/non-irrigated. The irrigation classification model uses the S1 and NDVI time series calculated over the selected training plots. Finally, the proposed irrigation classifier was validated using real in situ data collected each year. The results show that, using the proposed classification procedure, the overall accuracy for the irrigation classification reaches 84.3%, 93.0%, 81.8%, and 72.8% for the years 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The comparison between our proposed classification approach and the RF classifier built directly from in situ data showed that our approach reaches an accuracy nearly similar to that obtained using in situ RF classifiers with a difference in overall accuracy not exceeding 6.2%. The analysis of the obtained classification accuracies of the proposed method with precipitation data revealed that years with higher rainfall amounts during the summer crop-growing season (irrigation period) had lower overall accuracy (72.8% for 2017) whereas years encountering a drier summer had very good accuracy (93.0% for 2019).

TI  - Modeling of Water Distribution under Center Pivot Irrigation Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming to quantify the impacts of the center pivot irrigation technique on soil moisture dynamics and to improve irrigation crop water needs, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the water distribution pattern of a center pivot. The model is based on the ballistic theory modeling of a single sprinkler radial curve that simulates the trajectories of the droplets discharged by the sprinkler's nozzle. Subsequently, a water distribution pattern of a sprinkler irrigation technique (and ultimately center pivot) can be accurately estimated. This paper describes the theoretical and mathematical approaches of the developed model and its application in the case study, which was Las Tiesas farm in the area of Barrax, Spain, because the model was expanded to take into account the presence of not only one center pivot but multiple ones. In the case study, several center pivots with different characteristics in terms of size and hourly irrigation rates are present. The model correctly estimates the water distribution as it takes into account the different spatial (different sizes of pixels) and temporal basis (hourly and daily basis) and correctly estimates the water distribution when compared with satellite data. The results are given by the model, which is strictly done in the following order: simulating droplets trajectories, water distribution radial curve of single sprinkler, overlapped sprinklers patterns, and center pivots water distribution radial curve and patterns. The mathematical model gives the water distribution pattern under a center pivot irrigation system on a daily and hourly basis. The model can be adjusted to give the results not only for one center pivot but for two or more as desired.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Evolution of the Green Dam in Djelfa Province, Algeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Green walls and green dams are increasingly being considered as part of many national and international desertification initiatives. This paper studies the spatiotemporal evolution of the green dam in the Moudjbara region (Djelfa Province, Algeria), from 1972 to 2019, by using Landsat imagery, Land Change Modeler, and OpenLand package. The future evolution of pine plantations, for the year 2029, was also forecasted, based on an anthropogenic scenario (i.e., anthropogenic pressure is the main driver of the green dam destruction). Our findings revealed that the green dam project was successful for a few years, but, after that, pine plantations deteriorated significantly, due to forest harvesting, livestock overgrazing, and the proliferation of the pine caterpillar processionary, which destroyed most of the reforestation. Land change modeler predicted a huge degradation of pine plantations for the year 2029, and if the deforestation continues at the same rate, the green dam in the Moudjbara region will disappear during the next few decades. Being aware of this threat, the Algerian authorities are now planning to reforest more than 1.2 million ha under the latest rural renewal policy, by introducing new principles related to sustainable development, fighting desertification, and climate change adaptation. We strongly recommend moving away from the singular tree planting focus, to diversifying desertification control methods.

TI  - Risk factors for positive sentinel lymph node, lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination over time in patients with cutaneous melanoma
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of localization, age or sex and histopathological characteristics upon the chance of developing lymphatic or hematogenous metastatic spread over time, or a positive sentinel lymph node in cutaneous melanoma patients. Patients from the Department of Dermatology, County Emergency Hospital Cluj-Napoca (Cluj-Napoca, Romania), presenting with cutaneous melanoma confirmed histopathologically and a SPECT/CT or lymphoscintigraphic examination to detect the sentinel lymph node, were included in the present study. Our results revealed that Breslow index >2 mm [odds ratio (OR)=4.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.12; 15.93)], presence of ulceration [OR=6.01, 95% CI (1.87; 19.35)], and positive sentinel lymph node [for at least one sentinel lymph node OR=3.58, 95% CI (1.06; 12.04)] were risk factors for hematogenous metastases. All these, except for the Breslow index >2 mm, were demonstrated to be a risk factor for lymphatic spread metastases over time. Ulceration and male sex also represented risk factors for a positive sentinel lymph node, men having a higher risk of developing sentinel lymph nodes than women [adjusted OR=2.27, 95% CI (1.00; 5.13)]. In conclusion, the predictors that influence the occurrence of lymphatic or hematogenous metastases may differ, ulceration and positive sentinel lymph node being common for both types of metastatic spread, while Breslow index being a significant predictor only for hematogenous metastases. Male sex and the presence of ulceration were demonstrated to be significant risk factors for positive sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Statistical Approach for Defining Drained Lake Basins in a Continuous Permafrost Region, North Slope of Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake formation and drainage are pervasive phenomena in permafrost regions. Drained lake basins (DLBs) are often the most common landforms in lowland permafrost regions in the Arctic (50% to 75% of the landscape). However, detailed assessments of DLB distribution and abundance are limited. In this study, we present a novel and scalable remote sensing-based approach to identifying DLBs in lowland permafrost regions, using the North Slope of Alaska as a case study. We validated this first North Slope-wide DLB data product against several previously published sub-regional scale datasets and manually classified points. The study area covered >71,000 km(2), including a >39,000 km(2) area not previously covered in existing DLB datasets. Our approach used Landsat-8 multispectral imagery and ArcticDEM data to derive a pixel-by-pixel statistical assessment of likelihood of DLB occurrence in sub-regions with different permafrost and periglacial landscape conditions, as well as to quantify aerial coverage of DLBs on the North Slope of Alaska. The results were consistent with previously published regional DLB datasets (up to 87% agreement) and showed high agreement with manually classified random points (64.4-95.5% for DLB and 83.2-95.4% for non-DLB areas). Validation of the remote sensing-based statistical approach on the North Slope of Alaska indicated that it may be possible to extend this methodology to conduct a comprehensive assessment of DLBs in pan-Arctic lowland permafrost regions. Better resolution of the spatial distribution of DLBs in lowland permafrost regions is important for quantitative studies on landscape diversity, wildlife habitat, permafrost, hydrology, geotechnical conditions, and high-latitude carbon cycling.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Time Series for Crop Identification in the Framework of the Future CAP Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this upcoming Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the use of satellite imagery is taking an increasing role for improving the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). Considering the operational aspect of the CAP monitoring process, the use of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images is highly relevant, especially in regions with a frequent cloud cover, such as Belgium. Indeed, SAR imagery does not depend on sunlight and is barely affected by the presence of clouds. Moreover, the SAR signal is particularly sensitive to the geometry and the water content of the target. Crop identification is often a pre-requisite to monitor agriculture at parcel level (ploughing, harvest, grassland mowing, intercropping, etc.) The main goal of this study is to assess the performances and constraints of a SAR-based crop classification in an operational large-scale application. The Random Forest object-oriented classification model is built on Sentinel-1 time series from January to August 2020 only. It can identify crops in the Walloon Region (south part of Belgium) with high performance: 93.4% of well-classified area, representing 88.4% of the parcels. Among the 48 crop groups, the six most represented ones get a F1-score higher or equal to 84%. Additionally, this research documents how the classification performance is affected by different parameters: the SAR orbit, the size of the training dataset, the use of different internal buffers on parcel polygons before signal extraction, the set of explanatory variables, and the period of the time series. In an operational context, this allows to choose the right balance between classification accuracy and model complexity. A key result is that using a training dataset containing only 3.2% of the total number of parcels allows to correctly classify 91.7% of the agricultural area. The impact of rain and snow is also discussed. Finally, this research analyses how the classification accuracy depends on some characteristics of the parcels like their shape or size. This allows to assess the relevance of the classification depending on those characteristics, as well as to identify a subset of parcels for which the global accuracy is higher.

TI  - Application of Satellite-Based and Observed Precipitation Datasets for Hydrological Simulation in the Upper Mahi River Basin of Rajasthan, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modeling is an important tool used for basin management and studying the impacts of extreme events in a river basin. In streamflow simulations, precipitation plays an essential role in hydrological models. Meteorological satellite precipitation measurement techniques provide highly accurate rainfall information with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this analysis, the tropical rainfall monitoring mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 precipitation products were employed for simulating streamflow by using the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model. With India Metrological Department and TRMM data, the SWAT model can be used to predict streamflow discharge and identify sensitive parameters for the Mahi basin. The SWAT model was calibrated for 2 years and then independently validated for 2 years by comparing observed and simulated streamflow. A strong correlation was observed between the calibration and validation results for the Paderdibadi station, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of >0.34 and coefficient of determination (R-2) of >0.77. The SWAT model was used to adequately simulate the streamflow for the Upper Mahi basin with a satisfactory R-2 value. The analysis indicated that TRMM 3B42 V7 is useful in SWAT applications for predicting streamflow and performance and for sensitivity analysis. In addition, satellite data may require correction before its utilization in hydrological modeling. This study is helpful for stakeholders in monitoring and managing agricultural, climatic, and environmental changes.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Variation and Driving Mechanism of Ecological Environment Quality in the Arid Regions of Central Asia, Xinjiang
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystems are increasingly threatened by pressures from climate change and intensified human activity, especially in the arid region of Central Asia. A comprehensive understanding of the ecological environment changes is crucial for humans to implement environmental protection measures to adapt to climate change and alleviate the contradiction between humans and land. In this study, fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity of vegetation (GPP), land surface temperature (LST), and wetness (WET) were retrieved from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite remote sensing products in 2008 and 2018. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to establish the MODIS data-based ecological index (MODEI) in the study area, and the spatial differentiation characteristics and driving mechanism of ecological quality in the last ten years were explored. The results showed that: (1) FVC, GPP, LAI, and WET had positive effects on the ecological environment, while LST had a negative impact on the ecological environment. FVC and GPP were more significant than other indicators. (2) The MODEI showed a spatial pattern of "excellent in the north and poor in the south" and changed from north to south in the study area. (3) From 2008 to 2018, the average MODEI of Fuyun County increased from 0.292 to 0.303, indicating that the ecological quality in Fuyun County became better overall. The improved areas were mainly located in the summer pastures at higher elevations. In comparison, the deteriorated areas were concentrated in the spring and autumn pastures and winter pastures at lower elevations. The areas where the ecological environment had obviously improved and degraded were distributed along the banks of the Irtysh River and the Ulungur River. (4) With the increase in precipitation and the decrease in grazing pressure, the MODEI of summer pasture was improved. The deterioration of ecological environment quality in spring and autumn pastures and winter pastures was related to the excessive grazing pressure. The more significant changes in the MODEI on both sides of the river were associated with implementing the herdsmen settlement project. On the one hand, the implementation of newly settled villages increased the area of construction land on both sides of the river, which led to the deterioration of ecological quality; on the other hand, due to the increase in cropland land and the planting of artificial grasses along the river, the ecological quality was improved. The study offers significant information for managers to make more targeted ecological restoration efforts in ecologically fragile areas.

TI  - Analysis of Salt Lake Volume Dynamics Using Sentinel-1 Based SBAS Measurements: A Case Study of Lake Tuz, Turkey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the largest hypersaline lakes, Lake Tuz, located in the middle of Turkey, is a key waterbird habitat and is classified as a Special Environmental Protection Area in the country. It is a dynamic lake, highly affected by evaporation due to its wide expanse and shallowness (water depth <40 cm), in addition to being externally exploited by salt companies. Monitoring the dynamics of its changes in volume, which cause ecological problems, is required to protect its saline lake functions. In this context, a spatially homogeneous distributed gauge could be critical for monitoring and rapid response; however, the number of gauge stations and their vicinity is insufficient for the entire lake. The present study focuses on assessing the feasibility of a time-series interferometric technique, namely the small baseline subset (SBAS), for monitoring volume dynamics, based on freely available Sentinel-1 data. A levelling observation was also performed to quantify the accuracy of the SBAS results. Regression analysis between water levels, which is one of the most important volume dynamics, derived by SBAS and levelling in February, April, July and October was 67%, 80%, 84%, and 95% respectively, for correlation in the range of 10-40 cm in water level, and was in line with levelling. Salt lake components such as water, vegetation, moist soil, dry soil, and salt, were also classified with Sentinel-2 multispectral images over time to understand the reliability of the SBAS measurements based on interferometric coherence over different surface types. The findings indicate that the SBAS method with Sentinel-1 is a good alternative for measuring lake volume dynamics, including the monitoring of water level and salt movement, especially for the dry season. Even though the number of coherent, measurable, samples (excluding water) decrease during the wet season, there are always sufficient coherent samples (>0.45) over the lake.

T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - GIS and remote sensing approach is an effective tool to determine the morphological characteristics of the basin. Gilgel Abay watershed is stretched between latitude 10.56 degrees to 11.22 degrees N and longitude 36.44 degrees to 37.03 degrees E which is one major contributing river of Lake Tana which is the source of Blue Nile. The present study addressed linear and areal morphometric aspect of the watershed. The study deals with emphasis on the evolution of morphometric parameters such as stream order, stream length, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, stream frequency, texture ratio, elongation ratio, circularity ratio, and form factor ratio. The morphometric analysis of the basin revealed that Gilgel Abay is firth-order drainage basin with total of 662 drainage network, of which 511 are first order, 111 are second order, 30 are third order, 9 are fourth order, and 1 is fifth-order stream. The total length of stream is longer for first order and decrease with increasing stream order. The mean bifurcation ratio is 5.16 which is greater than the standard range, and it indicates that basin is mountainous and susceptible to flooding. Low drainage density is observed which is 0.6 km(-2). It indicates that basin is highly permeable and thick vegetation cover. Areal aspect of the morphometric analysis of the basin revealed that the basin is slightly potential to flooding and soil erosion, indicating that runoff generated from the upland area of the watershed is significantly infiltrated at the gentle downstream part and contributing to groundwater potential. Further studies with the help of GIS and remote sensing with high-resolution remote sensing data integrating with ground control data in the field are more effective to formulate appropriate type of natural resource management system.

TI  - Moustaches, Mantles, and Saffron Shirts: What Motivated Sumptuary Law in Medieval English Ireland?
T2  - SPECULUM-A JOURNAL OF MEDIEVAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sumptuary laws-laws that regulated displays of status through clothing, hairstyles, armor, and other visual markers-were enacted across Europe with increasing frequency beginning in the late thirteenth century. Sumptuary laws from the English colony in Ireland, promulgated from 1297 onward, have never been analyzed as a distinct corpus of law nor interpreted in the wider European context. Comparison of the Irish laws with their European counterparts highlights the markers of status that lawmakers in the colony were most anxious to preserve. Irish laws share the same core concern that prompted most sumptuary law: that a person's position in society was faithfully reflected in their appearance. They differ markedly from much European material, however, in the types of status with which they were primarily concerned. They rarely addressed, for example, the attire of women or sought to restrain expenditure. Most notably, in Europe the signaling of rank and social status was the main concern of sumptuary laws, while in Ireland differentiation by ethnicity was the primary focus. The relative inattention to social status in the Irish laws relates to several economic and societal factors but also reflects the centrality of ethnic division between English and Irish to the worldview of lawmakers in the colony.

TI  - Monitoring the Responses of Deciduous Forest Phenology to 2000-2018 Climatic Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the phenological responses of deciduous forests to climate is important, due to the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events associated with climate change and global warming, which will in turn affect vegetation seasonality. We investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of the response of deciduous forests to climatic anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere, using satellite-derived phenological metrics from the Copernicus Global Land Service Leaf Area Index, and multisource climatic datasets for 2000-2018 at resolutions of 0.1 degrees. Thereafter, we assessed the impact of extreme heatwaves and droughts on this deciduous forest phenology. We assumed that changes in the deciduous forest phenology in the Northern Hemisphere for the period 2000-2018 were monotonic, and that temperature and precipitation were the main climatic drivers. Analyses of partial correlations of phenological metrics with the timing of the start of the season (SoS), end of the season (EoS), and climatic variables indicated that changes in preseason temperature played a stronger role than precipitation in affecting the interannual variability of SoS anomalies: the higher the temperature, the earlier the SoS in most deciduous forests in the Northern Hemisphere (mean correlation coefficient of -0.31). Correlations between the SoS and temperature were significantly negative in 57% of the forests, and significantly positive in 15% of the forests (p < 0.05). Both temperature and precipitation contributed to the advance and delay of the EoS. A later EoS was significantly correlated with a positive Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at the regional scale (similar to 30% of deciduous forests). The timings of the EoS and SoS shifted by >20 d in response to heatwaves throughout most of Europe in 2003, and in the United States of America in 2012. This study contributes to improve our understanding of the phenological responses of deciduous forests in the Northern Hemisphere to climate change and extreme climate events.

TI  - INCORPORATING INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE IN MINE CLOSURE: RANGER URANIUM MINE
T2  - Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ranger Project Area, located on the lands of the Mirarr clan, is surrounded by Kakadu National Park. After 40 years of uranium production at Ranger Mine, rehabilitation has begun, with a commitment that the land will be restored to a standard such that it could be incorporated into Kakadu National Park. Historically, mine closure has not been done well in the Northern Territory, and little if any consideration has been given to the views of Aboriginal landowners. An Aboriginal perspective of country recognises the interrelationship, via local kinship and moiety systems, of all things - the rocks, plants, animals, people, stories, weather, ceremonies and tradition. There is an opportunity for this worldview to be incorporated into the rehabilitation of Ranger Mine. The mine's operator ERA (a subsidiary of Rio Tinto) has agreed to Cultural Closure Criteria that reflect a desire of Bininj (Aboriginal people from the region) to again use the land for hunting and gathering, recreation and cultural practice. Allowing Aboriginal people to have input to rehabilitation planning demonstrates a respect for people's knowledge and connection to country. At Ranger, where the mine was imposed against the wishes of the traditional owners, this is an important step in a return to stewardship of this land and reconnecting people to place.

TI  - Mediating mind-sets: the Cerro Khapia Landscape Reserve in the Peruvian Andes
T2  - ECO MONT-JOURNAL ON PROTECTED MOUNTAIN AREAS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The creation of protected mountain areas is often preceded by conflicts over access and use of natural resources. The case of the Cerro Khapia in the Peruvian Andes, however, points to mountains as not just nature but also culture. More than a decade ago, different ontologies and opposing views on mountains led to protests of the Aymara people against the exploitation of Cerro Khapia by a Canadian mining company, mainly because the mountain is the local Aymara's apu or tutelary god. Today, Cerro Khapia is temporarily protected as a Reserved Zone and on track to become a permanently protected area. Moreover, it is a case in point of the importance of questioning one's own ontological viewpoint and mediating different mind-sets.

TI  - Woody Above-Ground Biomass Estimation on Abandoned Agriculture Land Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned agricultural land (AAL) is a European problem and phenomenon when agricultural land is gradually overgrown with shrubs and forest. This wood biomass has not yet been systematically inventoried. The aim of this study was to experimentally prove and validate the concept of the satellite-based estimation of woody above-ground biomass (AGB) on AAL in the Western Carpathian region. The analysis is based on Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite data, supported by field research and airborne laser scanning. An improved AGB estimate was achieved using radar and optical multi-temporal data and polarimetric coherence by creating integrated predictive models by multiple regression. Abandonment is represented by two basic AAL classes identified according to overgrowth by shrub formations (AAL1) and tree formations (AAL2). First, an allometric model for AAL1 estimation was derived based on empirical material obtained from blackthorn stands. AAL2 biomass was quantified by different procedures related to (1) mature trees, (2) stumps and (3) young trees. Then, three satellite-based predictive mathematical models for AGB were developed. The best model reached R-2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 41.2 t center dot ha(-1) (35.1%), parametrized for an AGB range of 4 to 350 t center dot ha(-1). In addition to 3214 hectares of forest land, we identified 992 hectares of shrub-tree formations on AAL with significantly lower wood AGB than on forest land and with simple shrub composition.

TI  - The Impact of Seasonality and Land Cover on the Consistency of Relationship between Air Temperature and LST Derived from Landsat 7 and MODIS at a Local Scale: A Case Study in Southern Ontario
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature (T-air) have been commonly used to analyze urban heat island (UHI) effects throughout the world, with noted variations based on vegetation distribution. This research has compared time series LST data acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platforms, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and T-air from weather stations in the Southern Ontario area. The influence of the spatial resolution, land cover, vegetated surfaces, and seasonality on the relationship between LST and in situ T-air were examined. The objective is to identify spatial and seasonal differences amongst these different spatial resolution LST products and T-air, along with the causes for variations at a localized scale. Results show that MODIS LST from Terra had stronger relationships with Landsat 7 LST than those from Aqua. T-air demonstrated weaker correlations with Landsat LST than with MODIS LST in sparsely vegetated and urban areas during the summer. Due to the winter's ability to smooth heterogenous surfaces, both LST and T-air showed stronger relationships in winter than summer over every land cover, except with coarse spatial resolutions on forested surfaces.

TI  - Characterizing the Relationship between the Sediment Grain Size and the Shoreline Variability Defined from Sentinel-2 Derived Shorelines
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment grain size is a fundamental parameter conditioning beach-face morphology and shoreline changes. From remote sensing data, an efficient definition of the shoreline position as the water-land interface may allow studying the geomorphological characteristics of the beaches. In this work, shoreline variability is defined by extracting a set of Satellite Derived Shorelines (SDS) covering about three and a half years. SDS are defined from Sentinel 2 imagery with high accuracy (about 3 m RMSE) using SHOREX. The variability is related to a large dataset of grain-size samples from the micro-tidal beaches at the Gulf of Valencia (Western Mediterranean). Both parameters present an inverse and non-linear relationship probably controlled by the beach-face slope. High shoreline variability appears associated with fine sands, followed by a rapid decrease (shifting point about medium/coarse sand) and subsequent small depletions as grain sizes increases. The relationship between both parameters is accurately described by a numerical function (R-2 about 0.70) when considering samples at 137 open beaches. The definition of the variability is addressed employing different proxies, coastal segment lengths, and quantity of SDS under diverse oceanographic conditions, allowing to examine the effect they have on the relation with the sediment size. The relationship explored in this work improves the understanding of the mutual connection between sediment size, beach-face slope, and shoreline variability, and it may set up the basis for a rough estimation of sediment grain size from satellite optical imagery.

TI  - Side-Pumped, Conductively Cooled (Tm, Ho) YLF Pulsed Laser with More than One-Hundred-Nanosecond Pulse Width
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Owing to the advantages of being highly transmitted in the atmosphere, being safe to human eyes, being in the absorption spectrum band of water molecules, and being an efficient pump source for 3-5-ttm laser, solid-state lasers emitting around 2 m have been widely employed in many areas, including the medical field, high-precision ranging, environmental monitoring, and photoelectric counter-measurement. Laser source emitting at 2 ttm with high energy and high beam quality output performance is a paramount component of the remote wind-measuring light radar. In addition, more than one hundred nanosecond pulse duration and narrow spectral linewidth are required. Therefore, the Q -switched 2 -tan solid-state laser with a high energy output at room temperature has been a research hotspot for the space -borne lidar. Usually, the laser source used in the ground-based wind lidar system adopts the traditional liquid -cooling method, whereas those used in the air- or space -borne lidar system should adopt the conductive cooling design. To meet the special application requirement of the space-borne lidar, in this study, a laser diode (LD) side-pumped (Tm, Ho) YLF laser with a conductive cooling structure is developed by optimizing the key parameters of four-mirror ring cavity, such as the length of the cavity, the pump beam size inside the gain medium, output coupler mirror. As a result, high energy output with high energy efficiency and good beam quality are achieved.Methods The special eight-shaped ring cavity comprising two concave mirrors and two plane mirrors is designed (Fig. 1). The pulse width of the Q -switched laser is calculated as a function of cavity length (Fig. 2). To obtain a Q -switched pulse output of more than one hundred pulse width, the length of the ring cavity is chosen about 2580 mm. In theory, there are two waist positions inside the ring cavity, one placed with acousto-optic modulation (AOM) and another with (Tm, Ho) YLF crystal. In experiments, the driving signal waveform of the AOM is a square wave pulse with a pulse duration of 4 tts. In addition, the LD side -pumped arrangement with a novel wedge waveguide lens is specially designed (Fig. 4). The crystal rod is side-pumped by two banks of five radically arranged LD modules, each is capable of outputting a maximum of 200-W pump power. The size of the lens duct is designed by ZEMAX software, and the energy distribution is calculated by MATLAB (Fig. 5). Almost 48% of the absorbed pumping energy by the gain crystal ( the crystal radius is r = 2 mm) is centralized in the central area of the rod ( r <1.1 mm).Results and Discussions At a repetition rate of 1 Hz, pulse energy and pulse width variation are recorded as functions of the pump energy input in the free -running and Q -switched modes (Fig. 6). A maximum output pulse energy of 340 mJ is obtained in the free-running mode with 3.3 J of pump energy input; the optical -optical efficiency is approximately 10. 3%, and the slope efficiency is 22. 2 Yo. Meanwhile, the maximum output pulse energy of 141 mJ is obtained in the Q -switched mode with pump energy of 3. 3 J; the optical -optical efficiency is 4.3%, and the slope efficiency is 8.3 Yo. The output ratio of Q -switching to free -running reached up to 0.41. The Q -switched pulse waveform is detected by a photodetector with a 12. 5-GHz sampling rate, and a pulse width of about 103 ns is detected ( Fig. 7). Obviously, multilongitudinal mode lasing is demonstrated. The spectral linewidth is almost 0.82 nm (Fig. 8). The laser beam quality is measured using a lens with a focal length of 1 m and a CCD( Charge Coupled Device) camera; the spot diameter of the laser beam is recorded at different positions along the optic axis. Fitted by the Gaussian beam propagation equation, the beam quality factors of M2, and M-2, are achieved as 1.22 and 1. 08, respectively ( Fig. 9). The inlet in Fig. 9 shows the far-field intensity distribution of the laser beam, indicating the output pulse is near the fundamental transverse mode.Conclusions To meet the requirements of high pulse energy output at 2-ttm spectral range for remote wind measurement in space -borne lidar, an acousto-optic Q -switched, conductively cooled (Tm, Ho) YLF laser emitting at 2051 nm is developed in this study. In a specially designed eight-shaped ring cavity, using an LD side-pumped arrangement with a novel wedge waveguide lens-coupling system, a Q -switched laser pulse output with more than one hundred nanosecond pulse width is achieved. At a repetition of 1 Hz and maximum pump energy of 3. 3 J, a 141-mJ Q -switched laser with around 103-ns pulse width is obtained. The optical -optical and slope efficiencies are 4.3% and 8.3 yo, respectively. The central wavelength is 2051.4 nm, and beam quality factors of M2, and M2, are detected as 1.22 and 1.08, respectively. The experiment results are helpful to develop a high pulse energy of about 2-ttm laser pulse output with a narrow linewidth by adopting a seeder injection method, which is needed to develop the high-performance coherent wind lidar for remote detection.

TI  - The role of indocyanine green performing a minimally invasive right colectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF LAPAROSCOPIC AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite nowadays minimally invasive surgery is the standard approach for treatment of right colorectal cancer, surgical technique is not yet standardized and severe complications, such as anastomotic leakage, are still reported. Furthermore, some aspects of the technique, as the extension of the lymphadenectomy, are still debated. In recent years, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was introduced in laparoscopic surgery to provide more detailed anatomical information. Based on our experience in the use of ICG fluorescence technology and through a review of literature, this paper defines the possible different applications and potential advantages of ICG fluorescence imaging during laparoscopic right colectomy. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library database to identify relevant articles on ICG fluorescence guided surgery and laparoscopic right colectomy. In more detail, the paper describes the application of ICG fluorescence angiography to check bowel perfusion intraoperatively and its association with a lower rate of anastomotic leakage, when compared with standard approach. Then, it defines the sentinel lymph node mapping technique, with its possible application in early colon cancer and the importance of lymphatic mapping in detecting aberrant metastases. Finally, experimental applications, such as ureters and tumor tissue identification through fluorescence guided surgery and their potential developments in the future, are reported.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the relationship between changes in weather patterns and the spatial distribution of population and economic activity within countries. Our unique global dataset combines climatic and census data for the period 1950-2015 with satellite data on built-up areas, and light intensity at night for the 1990-2015 periods. We establish a global non-linear effect of climate on urbanisation. In particular, we find that deteriorating climatic conditions are associated with more urbanisation. This happens across the whole urban structure, with urbanisation increasing in both smaller and larger cities. But, we also find that weather variation can alter the national urban structure, including the pattern of urban concentration, as well as the size, density and spatial structure of large cities.

TI  - A GIS Methodology to Determine the Critical Regions for Mitigating Eutrophication in Large Territories: The Case of Jalisco, Mexico
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inadequate management practices for solid waste and wastewater are some of the main causes of eutrophication globally, especially in regions where intensive livestock, agricultural, and industrial activities are coupled with inexistent or ineffective waste and wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study, a methodological approach is presented to spatially assess the trophic state of large territories based on public water quality databases. The trophic state index (TSI) includes total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll A, chemical oxygen demand, and Secchi disk depth values as water quality indicators. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatiotemporal attributes of the water quality data, in addition to spatially displaying the results of TSI calculations. As a case study, this methodological approach was applied to determine the critical regions for mitigating eutrophication in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Although a decreasing trend was observed for the TSI values over time for most subbasins (2012-2019), a tendency for extreme hypereutrophication was observed in some regions, such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area and the Altos region, which are of high economic relevance at the state level. A correlation analysis was performed between the TSI parameters and rainfall measurements for all subbasins under analysis, which suggested a tendency for nutrient wash-off during the rainy seasons for most subbasins; however, further research is needed to quantify the real impacts of rainfall by including other variables such as elevation and slope. The relationships between the water quality indicators and land cover were also explored. The GIS methodology proposed in this study can be used to spatially assess the trophic state of large regions over time, taking advantage of available water quality databases. This will enable the efficient development and implementation of public policies to assess and mitigate the eutrophication of water sources, as well as the efficient allocation of resources for critical regions. Further studies should focus on applying integrated approaches combining on-site monitoring data, remote sensing data, and machine learning algorithms to spatially evaluate the trophic state of territories.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyses the urban expansion of the city of General Jose de San Martin in the province of Chaco (Argentina) and identifies state housing plans as one of the main elements in the appearance of growth areas in the city. The research focuses on aspects such as the distribution and quantification of the surface of the new areas of expansion and land occupied by the housing complexes between 1911 and 2017. It is based on the application of remote sensing and geographic information systems for spatial analysis and cartographic representation. The main sources of information have been the satellite images from the Landsat 5 and 8 missions and vector format layers. The main result is to reveal the expansion of the urban area in the period analysed and the incidence of the execution of state housing complexes as one of the causes of this process. In this way it is possible to generate evidence regarding the degree of state intervention in the configuration of the current territorial model of the city.

TI  - Detection of Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Liana Infestation Using Satellite-Derived Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lianas (woody vines) play a key role in tropical forest dynamics because of their strong influence on tree growth, mortality and regeneration. Assessing liana infestation over large areas is critical to understand the factors that drive their spatial distribution and to monitor change over time. However, it currently remains unclear whether satellite-based imagery can be used to detect liana infestation across closed-canopy forests and therefore if satellite-observed changes in liana infestation can be detected over time and in response to climatic conditions. Here, we aim to determine the efficacy of satellite-based remote sensing for the detection of spatial and temporal patterns of liana infestation across a primary and selectively logged aseasonal forest in Sabah, Borneo. We used predicted liana infestation derived from airborne hyperspectral data to train a neural network classification for prediction across four Sentinel-2 satellite-based images from 2016 to 2019. Our results showed that liana infestation was positively related to an increase in Greenness Index (GI), a simple metric relating to the amount of photosynthetically active green leaves. Furthermore, this relationship was observed in different forest types and during (2016), as well as after (2017-2019), an El Nino-induced drought. Using a neural network classification, we assessed liana infestation over time and showed an increase in the percentage of severely (>75%) liana infested pixels from 12.9% +/- 0.63 (95% CI) in 2016 to 17.3% +/- 2 in 2019. This implies that reports of increasing liana abundance may be more wide-spread than currently assumed. This is the first study to show that liana infestation can be accurately detected across closed-canopy tropical forests using satellite-based imagery. Furthermore, the detection of liana infestation during both dry and wet years and across forest types suggests this method should be broadly applicable across tropical forests. This work therefore advances our ability to explore the drivers responsible for patterns of liana infestation at multiple spatial and temporal scales and to quantify liana-induced impacts on carbon dynamics in tropical forests globally.

TI  - Retrieving Three-Dimensional Large Surface Displacements in Coal Mining Areas by Combining SAR Pixel Offset Measurements with an Improved Mining Subsidence Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can obtain one-dimensional surface displacements in the radar line of sight (LOS). In the field of mining subsidence, large 3D movements often occur at the same time, and hence InSAR derived one-dimensional LOS displacements can hardly reflect the actual surface motion in mining areas. To realize the monitoring of three-dimensional large surface displacements in mining areas, a method for monitoring three-dimensional large surface displacements in mining areas that combines SAR pixel offset tracking (OT) and an improved mining subsidence model is proposed in this article. First, a new functional relationship between surface subsidence and horizontal movement combined with the characteristics of the overburden rock stress and the deformation characteristics of the fractured rock mass in coal mining areas is established. Then, a three-dimensional surface deformation model is established based on the proposed relationship between surface subsidence and horizontal movement and the radar projection equation, and finally, the optimal parameters of the deformation model are inverted iteratively using LOS deformation results obtained by OT method to retrieve the three-dimensional large displacements of the surface. The significant advantage of the method proposed in this article is that it can accurately acquire the 3D large surface displacements using only two SAR amplitude images with the same imaging geometry. To verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed algorithm, two scenes of high-resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X images are used in this paper to conduct a three-dimensional surface displacement monitoring experiment on a working panel in the Daliuta mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, based on the proposed method. Experimental monitoring results show that the maximum surface subsidence is approximately 4.5 m, and the maximum horizontal movements in the strike and dip directions are approximately 1.4 m and 1.2 m, respectively. Using GPS measurements to verify the monitoring results, the root mean square error (RMSE) of vertical subsidence is 6.8 cm, and the RMSE of horizontal movement is 7.1 cm. Compared with those in the original mining subsidence model, the accuracies of vertical subsidence and horizontal movement in the proposed model are increased by 28.2% and 37.5%, respectively, which proves the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method.

TI  - Comparing Methods for Segmenting Supra-Glacial Lakes and Surface Features in the Mount Everest Region of the Himalayas Using Chinese GaoFen-3 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and numerous glacial lakes that are produced by glacier melting are key indicators of climate change. Often overlooked, supra-glacial lakes develop in the melting area in the low-lying part of a glacier and appear to be highly variable in their size, shape, and location. The lifespan of these lakes is thought to be quite transient, since the lakes may be completely filled by water and burst out within several weeks. Changes in supra-glacial lake outlines and other surface features such as supra-glacial rivers and crevasses on the glaciers are useful indicators for the direct monitoring of glacier changes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is not affected by weather and climate, and is an effective tool for study of glaciated areas. The development of the Chinese GaoFen-3 (GF-3) SAR, which has high spatial and temporal resolution and high-precision observation performance, has made it possible to obtain dynamic information about glaciers in more detail. In this paper, the classical Canny operator, the variational B-spline level-set method, and U-Net-based deep-learning model were applied and compared to extract glacial lake outlines and other surface features using different modes and Chinese GF-3 SAR imagery in the Mount Everest Region of the Himalayas. Particularly, the U-Net-based deep-learning method, which was independent of auxiliary data and had a high degree of automation, was used for the first time in this context. The experimental results showed that the U-Net-based deep-learning model worked best in the segmentation of supra-glacial lakes in terms of accuracy (Precision = 98.45% and Recall = 95.82%) and segmentation efficiency, and was good at detecting small, elongated, and ice-covered supra-glacial lakes. We also found that it was useful for accurately identifying the location of supra-glacial streams and ice crevasses on glaciers, and quantifying their width. Finally, based on the time series of the mapping results, the spatial characteristics and temporal evolution of these features over the glaciers were comprehensively analyzed. Overall, this study presents a novel approach to improve the detection accuracy of glacier elements that could be leveraged for dynamic monitoring in future research.

TI  - CycleGAN-STF: Spatiotemporal Fusion via CycleGAN-Based Image Generation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the trade-off of temporal resolution and spatial resolution, spatiotemporal image-fusion uses existing high-spatial-low-temporal (HSLT) and high-temporal-low-spatial (HTLS) images as prior knowledge to reconstruct high-temporal-high-spatial (HTHS) images. However, some existing spatiotemporal image-fusion algorithms ignore the issue that the spatial information of HTLS images is insufficient to support the acquisition of spatial information, which leads to the unsatisfactory accuracy of the fusion result. To introduce more spatial information, the algorithm in this article uses Cycle-generative adversarial networks (GANs) to simulate the change process of two HSLT images at , and to generate some simulated images between and. Then, the generated images are selected under the help of HTLS images, and the selected ones are then enhanced with wavelet transform. Finally, the image with spatial information is introduced into the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) framework to improve the performance of spatiotemporal image-fusion. Extensive experiments on two real data sets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art spatiotemporal image-fusion methods.

TI  - New Insights into the Pulang Porphyry Copper Deposit in Southwest China: Indication of Alteration Minerals Detected Using ASTER and WorldView-3 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pulang porphyry copper deposit (PCD), one of the main potential areas for copper resource exploration in China, exhibits typical porphyry alteration zoning. However, further investigation of the indicative significance of alteration minerals, additional insight into metallogenic characteristics, and prospecting guidelines continue to be challenging. In this study, ASTER and WorldView-3 data were used to map hydrothermal alteration minerals by employing band ratios, principal component analysis, and spectrum-area techniques; and subsequently, the indication significance of alteration minerals was studied in-depth. The following new insights into the metallogenic structure and spatial distribution of alteration zoning in Pulang PCD were obtained and verified. (1) A new NE trending normal fault, passing through the northeast of Pulang PCD, was discovered. (2) Two mineralization alteration centers, exhibiting alteration zoning characteristics of potassic-silicified, phyllic, and propylitic zones from the inside to the outside, were observed on both sides of the fault. (3) At the junction of the redivided potassic-silicification and phyllic zones, favorable prospecting potential areas were delineated. This study shows that the spectral/multi-sensor satellite data are valuable and cost-effective tools for the preliminary stages of porphyry copper exploration in inaccessible and remote areas around the world.

TI  - Mapping Sandy Land Using the New Sand Differential Emissivity Index From Thermal Infrared Emissivity Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of the spectral shape of thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity for sandy land, a remote sensing sand index called the sand differential emissivity index (SDEI) is proposed in this article to simply and conveniently detect sandy land over large areas. The SDEI is evaluated on ground, airborne, and spaceborne thermal emissivity data, and it shows good characterization of sandy land and performs better in sandy land identification than two previous indices. The SDEI was also evaluated in the transition zones of Chinax2019;s four mega-sandy lands and was applied to long-term land surface emissivity to obtain the spatial distribution and variation in Chinax2019;s sandy land from 2000 to 2016. The findings showed that a mean accuracy of 96x0025; and a mean kappa coefficient of 0.83 were obtained in the transition zones, and the sandy land in the transition zone exhibited a decreasing trend over the past 17 years and a significant decline in the Mu Us sandy land. Meanwhile, the sandy land area in China decreased by km(2) (1.53x0025;) by the end of 2016 compared with that in early 2000.

TI  - Quantitatively Estimating of InSAR Decorrelation Based on Landsat-Derived NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a by-product of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR, InSAR) technique, interferometric coherence is a measure of the decorrelation noise for InSAR observation, where the lower the coherence value, the more serious the decorrelation noise. In the densely vegetated area, the coherence value could be too low to obtain any valuable signals, leading to the degradation of InSAR performance and the possible waste of expensive SAR data. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value is a measure of the vegetation coverage and can be estimated from the freely available optical satellite images. In this paper, a multi-stage model is established to quantitatively estimate the decorrelation noise for vegetable areas based on Landsat-derived NDVI prior to the acquisition of SAR data. The modeling process is being investigated with the L-band ALOS-1/PALSAR-1 data and the Landsat-5 optical data acquired in the Meitanba area of Hunan Province, China. Furthermore, the reliability of the established model is verified in the Longhui area, which is situated near the Meitanba area. The results demonstrate that the established model can quantitatively estimate InSAR decorrelation associated with the vegetation coverage.

TI  - ARU-Net: Reduction of Atmospheric Phase Screen in SAR Interferometry Using Attention-Based Deep Residual U-Net
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric phase screen (APS) is a very critical issue for the application of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. The spatialx2013;temporal variations of APS are the dominant error source in interferograms and may completely mask displacement signals. Many external meteorological data-based methods and phase-based methods have been developed in the past decades, but all have their inherent limitations. In this article, we propose a deep learning-based method, which is based on an attention-based deep residual U-shaped network (ARU-Net), to mitigate atmospheric artifacts. With this approach, APS patches and clean interferogram patches are sampled from InSAR interferograms to train the network. After training, the network can be used to mitigate the APS for individual interferograms. Compared with the generic atmospheric correction model (GACOS) and the advanced time-series InSAR method distributed scatterer interferometry (DSI), the key advantage of our method is that atmospheric delay can be effectively learned and removed from individual high-resolution interferometric phase itself without external data. Accuracy was validated by using individual and stacked interferograms from TerraSAR-X data over the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP) sites. The results showed that our method consistently delivered greater standard deviation (SD) reduction after APS correction than the GACOS method. Moreover, the time-series results were in agreement with the DSI and leveling measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed ARU-Net to remove APS effects from interferograms shows great potential for the development of a new set of deep learning-based APS reduction methods.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and a Markov-FLUS Model to Simulate Future Land Use Changes in Hokkaido, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the second largest island in Japan, Hokkaido provides precious land resources for the Japanese people. Meanwhile, as the food base of Japan, the gradual decrease of the agricultural population and more intensive agricultural practices on Hokkaido have led its arable land use to change year by year, which has also caused changes to the whole land use pattern of the entire island of Hokkaido. To realize the sustainable use of land resources in Hokkaido, past and future changes in land use patterns must be investigated, and target-based land use planning suggestions should be given on this basis. This study uses remote sensing and GIS technology to analyze the temporal and spatial changes of land use in Hokkaido during the past two decades. The types of land use include cultivated land, forest, waterbody, construction, grassland, and others, by using the satellite images of the Landsat images in 2000, 2010, and 2019 to achieve this goal to make classification. In addition, this study used the coupled Markov-FLUS model to simulate and analyze the land use changes in three different scenarios in Hokkaido in the next 20 years. Scenario-based situational analysis shows that the cultivated land in Hokkaido will drop by about 25% in 2040 under the natural development scenario (ND), while the cultivated land area in Hokkaido will remain basically unchanged in cultivated land protection scenario (CP). In forest protection scenario (FP), the area of forest in Hokkaido will increase by 1580.8 km(2). It is believed that the findings reveal that the forest land in Hokkaido has been well protected in the past and will be protected well in the next 20 years. However, in land use planning for future, Hokkaido government and enterprises should pay more attention to the protection of cultivated land.

TI  - Quantitative Remote Sensing of Metallic Elements for the Qishitan Gold Polymetallic Mining Area, NW China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent development in remote sensing imagery and the use of remote sensing detection feature spectrum information together with the geochemical data is very useful for the surface element quantitative remote sensing inversion study. This aim of this article is to select appropriate methods that would make it possible to have rapid economic prospecting. The Qishitan gold polymetallic deposit in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Northwest China has been selected for this study. This paper establishes inversion maps based on the contents of metallic elements by integrating geochemical exploration data with ASTER and WorldView-2 remote sensing data. Inversion modelling maps for As, Cu, Hg, Mo, Pb, and Zn are consistent with the corresponding geochemical anomaly maps, which provide a reference for metallic ore prospecting in the study area. ASTER spectrum covers short-wave infrared and has better accuracy than WorldView-2 data for the inversion of some elements (e.g., Au, Hg, Pb, and As). However, the high spatial resolution of WorldView-2 drives the final content inversion map to be more precise and to better localize the anomaly centers of the inversion results. After scale conversion by re-sampling and kriging interpolation, the modeled and predicted accuracy of the models with square interpolation is much closer compare with the ground resolution of the used remote sensing data. This means our results are much satisfactory as compared to other interpolation methods. This study proves that quantitative remote sensing has great potential in ore prospecting and can be applied to replace traditional geochemical exploration to some extent.

TI  - Comparison of In-Situ Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Time Series and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument Data in Slovenian National Waters (Gulf of Trieste, Adriatic Sea)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - While satellite remote sensing of ocean color is a viable tool for estimating large-scale patterns of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and global ocean primary production, its application in coastal waters is limited by the complex optical properties. An exploratory study was conducted in the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) to assess the usefulness of Sentinel-3 satellite data in the Slovenian national waters. OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) Chl-a level 2 products (OC4Me and NN) were compared to monthly Chl-a in-situ measurements at fixed sites from 2017 to 2019. In addition, eight other methods for estimating Chl-a concentration based on reflectance in different spectral bands were tested (OC3M, OC4E, MedOC4, ADOC4, AD4, 3B-OLCI, 2B-OLCI and G2B). For some of these methods, calibration was performed on in-situ data to achieve a better agreement. Finally, L1-regularized regression and random forest were trained on the available dataset to test the capabilities of the machine learning approach. The results show rather poor performance of the two originally available products. The same is true for the other eight methods and the fits to the measured values also show only marginal improvement. The best results are obtained with the blue-green methods (OC3, OC4 and AD4), especially the AD4SI (a designated fit of AD4) with R = 0.56 and RMSE = 0.4 mg/m(3), while the near infrared (NIR) methods show underwhelming performance. The machine learning approach can only explain 30% of the variability and the RMSE is of the same order as for the blue-green methods. We conclude that due to the low Chl-a concentration and the moderate turbidity of the seawater, the reflectance provided by the Sentinel-3 OLCI spectrometer carries little information about Chl-a in the Slovenian national waters within the Gulf of Trieste and is therefore of limited use for our purposes. This requires that we continue to improve satellite products for use in those marine waters that have not yet proven suitable. In this way, satellite data could be effectively integrated into a comprehensive network that would allow a reliable assessment of ecological status, taking into account environmental regulations.

TI  - Spectral Characteristics of the Antarctic Vegetation: A Case Study of Barton Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral information is a proxy for understanding the characteristics of ground targets without a potentially disruptive contact. A spectral library is a collection of this information and serves as reference data in remote sensing analyses. Although widely used, data of this type for most ground objects in polar regions are notably absent. Remote sensing data are widely used in polar research because they can provide helpful information for difficult-to-access or extensive areas. However, a lack of ground truth hinders remote sensing efforts. Accordingly, a spectral library was developed for 16 common vegetation species and decayed moss in the ice-free areas of Antarctica using a field spectrometer. In particular, the relative importance of shortwave infrared wavelengths in identifying Antarctic vegetation using spectral similarity comparisons was demonstrated. Due to the lack of available remote sensing images of the study area, simulated images were generated using the developed spectral library. Then, these images were used to evaluate the potential performance of the classification and spectral unmixing according to spectral resolution. We believe that the developed library will enhance our understanding of Antarctic vegetation and will assist in the analysis of various remote sensing data.

TI  - Microplankton size structure induced by a warm-core eddy in the western Bay of Bengal: Role of <i>Trichodesmium</i> abundance
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale warm-core eddies are common in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), and this study in the western BoB during Pre-Southwest Monsoon (April 2015) presents how a prolonged warm-core core eddy could modify the microplankton biomass and size structure. To investigate this, field sampling and laboratory analyses were augmented with satellite data sets of sea surface temperature (SST), winds, mean sea level anomaly (MSLA), geostrophic currents and chlorophyll-a. High SST with positive MSLA (>= 20 cm) and a clockwise circulation, represented the occurrence of a large warm-core eddy in the western BoB. Time series data evidenced that it was originated in the mid of March and persistent there till early June, which in turn caused a decrease in the surface nutrients and chlorophyll-a. The abundance and biomass of microplankton were negligible in the warm-core eddy region. FIowCAM data showed a significant decrease in the autotrophic microplankton parameters in the warm-core eddy (av. 13 +/- 9 ind. L-1 and 0.1 +/- 0.04 mu gC L-1, respectively) as compared to the surrounding locations (av. 227 +/- 143 ind. L-1 and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mu gC L-1, respectively). Low nutrients level in the warm core eddy region favoured high abundance of needle-shaped phytoplankton cells dominated by Trichodesmium cells. As a result, the size of micro-autotrophs in the warm-core eddy was larger (av. 91,760 +/- 12,902 mu m(3) ind.(-1)) than its outside (av. 50,115 +/- 21,578 mu m(3) ind.(-1)). This is a deviation from our belief that the oligotrophy decreases the phytoplankton size. We showed here that the above understanding might not be infallible in warm-core eddies in the northern Indian Ocean due to its inducing effect on the Trichodesmium abundance.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although multimodal remote sensing data analysis can strongly improve the characterization of physical phenomena on Earthx2019;s surface, nonidealities and estimation imperfections between records and investigation models can limit its actual information extraction ability. In this article, we aim at predicting the maximum information extraction that can be reached when analyzing a given data set. By means of an asymptotic information theory-based approach, we investigate the reliability and accuracy that can be achieved under optimal conditions for multimodal analysis as a function of data statistics and parameters that characterize the multimodal scenario to be addressed. Our approach leads to the definition of two indices that can be easily computed before the actual processing takes place. Moreover, we report in this article how they can be used for operational use in terms of image selection in order to maximize the robustness of the multimodal analysis, as well as to properly design data collection campaigns for understanding and quantifying physical phenomena. Experimental results show the consistency of our approach.

TI  - Classifying Planetary Cloudiness with an Updated Set of MODIS Cloud Regimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an updated cloud regime (CR) dataset based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 cloud products, specifically, joint histograms that partition cloud fraction within distinct combinations of cloud-top pressure and cloud optical thickness ranges. The paper focuses on an edition of the CR dataset derived from our own aggregation of MODIS pixel-level cloud retrievals on an equal-area grid and prespecified 3-h UTC intervals that spatiotemporally match International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) gridded cloud data. The other edition comes from the 1 degrees daily aggregation provided by standard MODIS Level-3 data, as in previous versions of the MODIS CRs, for easier use with datasets mapped on equal-angle grids. Both editions consist of 11 clusters whose centroids are nearly identical. We provide a physical interpretation of the new CRs and aspects of their climatology that have not been previously examined, such as seasonal and interannual variability of CR frequency of occurrence. We also examine the makeup and precipitation properties of the CRs assisted by independent datasets originating from active observations and provide a first glimpse of how MODIS CRs relate to clouds as seen by ISCCP.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We present an updated 17-yr dataset of global cloudiness classification from the space-based MODIS instrument. This dataset exhibits similar consistency with the cloud and precipitation characteristics seen by active observations in the previous version, but its greater length allows an initial analysis of trends of cloud systems with distinct physical properties and geographical characteristics. Furthermore, custom tailoring to spatiotemporally match the ISCCP dataset enables systematic comparisons with that seminal description of cloud climatological characteristics.

TI  - Mapping Potential Plant Species Richness over Large Areas with Deep Learning, MODIS, and Species Distribution Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial patterns of species richness can be used as indicators for conservation and restoration, but data problems, including the lack of species surveys and geographical data gaps, are obstacles to mapping species richness across large areas. Lack of species data can be overcome with remote sensing because it covers extended geographic areas and generates recurring data. We developed a Deep Learning (DL) framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and modeled potential species richness by stacking species distribution models (S-SDMs) to ask, "What are the spatial patterns of potential plant species richness across the Korean Peninsula, including inaccessible North Korea, where survey data are limited?" First, we estimated plant species richness in South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of 1574 species and used independent plant surveys to validate our potential species richness maps. Next, DL-based species richness models were fitted to the species richness results in South Korea, and a time-series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS. The individually developed models from South Korea were statistically tested using datasets that were not used in model training and obtained high accuracy outcomes (0.98, Pearson correlation). Finally, the proposed models were combined to estimate the richness patterns across the Korean Peninsula at a higher spatial resolution than the species survey data. From the statistical feature importance tests overall, growing season NDVI-related features were more important than LAI features for quantifying biodiversity from remote sensing time-series data.

TI  - The Problem of Dualistic Worldviews in a Season of Climate Change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the dualistic worldview surrounding climate change to be found among evangelicals in the United States. Since the majority of the traditionalist American evangelicals identify themselves with the Republican party, their views towards climate change tends to be highly skeptical: they tend to favour policies that protect the free-market economy. The Cornwall Alliance and its evangelical constituency, in particular, has provided a ground for a critical discussion concerning an association of Christian faith with conservative political ideologies from a particular biblical viewpoint. The key framework in the Alliance's theological claims against environmentalism in general is an assumed dualism. This interpretive lens increases political bias prejudice thereby impeding constructive discussion and a much needed co-operation between parties in the era of climate change.

TI  - Satellite-Based Aerosol Classification for Capital Cities in Asia Using a Random Forest Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol types in Asian capital cities were classified using a random forest (RF) satellite-based aerosol classification model during 2018-2020 in an investigation of the contributions of aerosol types, with or without Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations. In this study, we used the recently developed RF aerosol classification model to detect and classify aerosols into four types: pure dust, dust-dominated aerosols, strongly absorbing aerosols, and non-absorbing aerosols. Aerosol optical and microphysical properties for each aerosol type detected by the RF model were found to be reasonably consistent with those for typical aerosol types. In Asian capital cities, pollution-sourced aerosols, especially non-absorbing aerosols, were found to predominate, although Asian cities also tend to be seasonally affected by natural dust aerosols, particularly in East Asia (March-May) and South Asia (March-August). No specific seasonal effects on aerosol type were detected in Southeast Asia, where there was a predominance of non-absorbing aerosols. The aerosol types detected by the RF model were compared with those identified by other aerosol classification models. This study indicates that the satellite-based RF model may be used as an alternative in the absence of AERONET sites or observations.

TI  - Topoclimate Mapping Using Landsat ETM plus Thermal Data: Wolin Island, Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in climatic pattern due to boundary layer processes at the topoclimatic scale are critical for ecosystems and human activity, including agriculture, fruit harvesting, and animal husbandry. Here, a new method for topoclimate mapping based on land surface temperature (LST) computed from the brightness temperature of Landsat ETM+ thermal bands (band6) is presented. The study was conducted in a coastal lowland area with glacial landforms (Wolin Island). The method presented is universal for various areas, and is based on freely available remote sensing data. The topoclimatic typology obtained was compared to the classical one based on meteorological data. It was proven to show a good sensitivity to changes in topoclimatic conditions (demonstrated by changes in LST distribution) even in flat, agricultural areas with only small variations in topography. The technique will hopefully prove to be a convenient and relatively fast tool that can improve the topoclimatic classification of other regions. It could be applied by local authorities and farmer associations for optimizing agricultural production.

TI  - Newman, Catholicity, and the Church Today: On the Development of Christian Principles through Dialogue with the World
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the following question: Given the Roman Catholic Church's present-day teaching on catholicity, how can St. John Henry Newman's historically conscious, imaginative view of catholicity assist Catholic Christians today in understanding the concept faithfully, but in a manner 'open' to its potential development in an age of shifting metaphysics? After (1) an introduction to the topic and challenges to the notion of catholicity today, this article then (2) analyzes the present-day view of catholicity as a mark of the church according to the 'Catechism of the Catholic Church', noting areas of development as well as limitations. The article then (3) investigates Newman's understanding of catholicity within his sacramental and imaginative worldview. Newman's understanding of the development of principles and doctrines is particularly relevant for a consideration today of how the church's view of catholicity might authentically develop from a dialogue between religion and science. The article then (4) synthesizes results in a concluding section that indicates how the fruits of the preceding analysis could be realized through eco-theological dialogue.

TI  - Assessing cyanobacterial frequency and abundance at surface waters near drinking water intakes across the United States
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the first large-scale assessment of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance of surface water near drinking water intakes across the United States. Public water systems serve drinking water to nearly 90% of the United States population. Cyanobacteria and their toxins may degrade the quality of finished drinking water and can lead to negative health consequences. Satellite imagery can serve as a cost-effective and consistent monitoring technique for surface cyanobacterial blooms in source waters and can provide drinking water treatment operators information for managing their systems. This study uses satellite imagery from the European Space Agency's Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) spanning June 2016 through April 2020. At 300-m spatial resolution, OLCI imagery can be used to monitor cyanobacteria in 685 drinking water sources across 285 lakes in 44 states, referred to here as resolvable drinking water sources. First, a subset of satellite data was compared to a subset of responses (n = 84) submitted as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's fourth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 4). These UCMR 4 qualitative responses included visual observations of algal bloom presence and absence near drinking water intakes from March 2018 through November 2019. Overall agreement between satellite imagery and UCMR 4 qualitative responses was 94% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. Next, temporal frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable drinking water sources was assessed. In 2019, bloom frequency averaged 2% and peaked at 100%, where 100% indicated a bloom was always present at the source waters when satellite imagery was available. Monthly cyanobacterial abundances were used to assess short-term trends across all resolvable drinking water sources and effect size was computed to provide insight on the number of years of data that must be obtained to increase confidence in an observed change. Generally, 2016 through 2020 was an insufficient time period for confidently observing changes at these source waters; on average, a decade of satellite imagery would be required for observed environmental trends to outweigh variability in the data. However, five source waters did demonstrate a sustained short-term trend, with one increasing in cyanobacterial abundance from June 2016 to April 2020 and four decreasing.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of biophysical parameters of irrigated maize using orbital remote sensing
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes to estimate the actual crop evapotranspiration, using the SAFER model, as well as calculate the crop coefficient (Kc) as a function of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and determine the biomass of an irrigated maize crop using images from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared (TIRS) sensors of the Landsat-8 satellite. Pivots 21 to 26 of a commercial farm located in the municipalities of Bom Jesus da Lapa and Serra do Ramalho, west of Bahia State, Brazil, were selected. Sowing dates for each pivot were arranged as North and South or East and West, with cultivation starting firstly in one of the orientations and subsequently in the other. The relationship between NDVI and the Kc values obtained in the FAO-56 report (Kc(FAO)) revealed a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.7921), showing that the variance of Kc(FAO) can be explained by NDVI in the maize crop. Considering the center pivots with different planting dates, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) pixel values ranged from 0.0 to 6.0 mm d(-1) during the phenological cycle. The highest values were found at 199 days of the year (DOY), corresponding to around 100 days after sowing (DAS). The lowest BIO values occur at 135 DOY, at around 20 DAS. There is a relationship between ETc and BIO, where the DOY with the highest BIO are equivalent to the days with the highest ETc values. In addition to this relationship, BIO is strongly influenced by soil water availability.

TI  - Landscape Changes in the Southern Coalfields of West Virginia: Multi-Level Intensity Analysis and Surface Mining Transitions in the Headwaters of the Coal River from 1976 to 2016
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes land-cover transitions in the headwaters of the Big Coal River in the Central Appalachian Region of the US, from 1976 to 2016, where surface mining was found as the major driver of landscape change. The land-change analysis combined Multi-Level Intensity Analysis for two-time intervals (1976-1996, 1996-2016) with Difference Components, to differentiate suspected misclassification errors from actual changes. Two land cover classifications were obtained with segmentation analysis and machine learning algorithms from historical high-resolution aerial images and ancillary data. Intensity Analysis allowed for the inspection of transitions across five land cover (LC) classes and measure the degree of non-stationarity of land change patterns. Results found surface mining-related classes and their transitions, including the effects of reclamation processes on areas mined before the enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA, 1977). Results included changes in settlement distribution, low vegetation, water bodies, and forest class transitions. The findings can be applied to infer similar land-change processes in the more extensive Appalachian region where Mountain Top Removal (MTR) operations are widespread. The overall method can be used to address similar problems and inform landscape managers with detailed data to support land use alternatives and conservation in regions that experienced intense changes and are characterized by anthropogenic disturbances and novel ecosystems.

TI  - Contribution of Earth Observation and Geospatial Information for Urban Planning of Historic Cities' Centres: The Case Study of Nicosia, Cyprus
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations state that cities and human settlements need to be more inclusive, safe and resilient. In Europe cities have experienced dramatic physical, social and economic changes during the last decades while historic centres of European cities, among the most important assets of the European cultural heritage, are living paradoxes. They are defined as "a collection of beauty, icon of well-being, model of sustainability, but abandoned". This study investigates the changes in the urban landscape of Nicosia, a particular historical centre in the Mediterranean region (Cyprus). The city centre is characterised by exceptionally well-preserved Venetian fortifications. Due to political circumstances, the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia, is still divided and has been ruled by two different administrations for several decades. This study used optical multi-spectral satellite datasets processing, like the Landsat and the most recent Sentinel-2 products, to detect, identify and characterise significant morphological transformations within the walled city and around it. This paper's central thesis promotes a more systematic use of earth observation products and derivatives in decision-making processes that regard planning, use and management of urban resources in Europe, especially in support of urban planning strategies of historic cities.

T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE AGRONOMIA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is currently a global problem, as it significantly affects the dynamics of vegetation. The objective of this research is to analyze the influence of climate variability on the dynamics of vegetation in the Portoviejo river basin. The methodology consisted in the calculation of the NDVI with the use of multispectral images from the Landsat satellite and the analysis of the fluviometric records. The images were downloaded from the Earth Explorer geospatial platform with a spatial resolution of 30 m, images from the period 1998-2019 were selected to analyze their temporal trend. The historical fluviometric records of the Portoviejo station, of the National Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology were used. The results showed that the vegetation experienced a discontinuous greening trend, influenced by the variability of rainfall. A homogeneous trend was found in the spatial distribution of the NDVI, with dense and very dense vegetation cover in the upper part of the basin, as well as little or no cover in the lower part. The area with the greatest coverage corresponded to dense vegetation with a percentage higher than 30%.

TI  - Assessing the Spatial and Temporal Relationship between Coastal Runoff and Chlorophyll-α in the Philippines Using Gridded Datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Publicly available gridded datasets were used in examining the relationship between long-term temporal patterns in runoff rates and chlorophyll-alpha within the coastal areas of the Philippines. Temporal plots generated from remotely sensed chlorophyll-alpha data and runoff from the Global Runoff Reconstruction dataset illustrated variabilities in seasonal patterns across coastal segments and climate types. The linear correlation analysis performed on the datasets revealed a characteristic distribution of negative coefficients within the internal seas of the archipelago and positive coefficients in open coasts and embayments. Riverine-influenced sites with positive correlation coefficients (r = 0.33-0.62, p < 0.00001) were mostly associated with delivery of excess nutrients from land-use activities. The distribution of these coefficients was demonstrated to be affected by the physical nature of the coast. Moreover, seasonal changes in total suspended solids adjacent to a river discharge site were discussed, demonstrating how high sediment load can dampen productivity because of limited light penetration in marine waters. The analysis of publicly available datasets in this study provided assessments that can be used to complement coastal management efforts, particularly in the context of increasing anthropogenic stress and climate change.

TI  - Concordance between preoperative ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification and final histology in early-stage endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the concordance between preoperative European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)-European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO)-European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) risk classification in early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) assessed by biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with this classification based on histology of surgical specimen.Methods: This bicentric retrospective study included women diagnosed with early-stage EC (<= stage II) who had a complete preoperative assessment and underwent a surgical management from January 2011 to December 2018. Patients were preoperatively classified into 3 degrees of risk of lymph node (LN) involvement based on biopsy and MRI. Based on final histological report, patients were re-classified using the preoperative classification. Concordance between the preoperative assessment and definitive histology was calculated with weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient.Results: A total of 333 women were included and kappa coefficient of preoperative risk classification was 0.49. The risk was underestimated and overestimated in 37% and 10% of cases, respectively. Twenty-nine percent of patients had an incomplete LN staging according to the degree of risk of re-classification. The observed discordance in the risk classification was attributed to MRI in 75% of cases, to biopsy in 18% and in 7% to both (p<0.001). Kappa coefficient for concordance was 0.25 for MRI and 0.73 for biopsy.Conclusion: Concordance between preoperative ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification and final histology is weak. Given that the risk was underestimated in the majority of patients wrongly classified, sentinel LN procedure instead of no LN dissection could be an option offered to preoperative low-risk patients to decrease the indication of second surgery for restaging and/or to avoid toxicity of adjuvant radiotherapy.

TI  - Development of Strategy for SWAT Hydrologic Modeling in Data-Scarce Regions of Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, methods were developed to create and evaluate the performance of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in southern Peru where commonly used input data sources were not available. Soil classes were defined based on regional soil taxonomy and suitability maps combined with soil profiles. Local land cover and remotely sensed satellite data were used to develop a land cover database. Water balance analysis of the reservoir as well as satellite evapotranspiration data were used for model performance assessment. Results showed that these strategies provided reliable predictions of hydrology in this region, with the uncertainty quantified based on the range of inputs. Overall, this semiarid watershed was base flow driven and average annual surface runoff contribution to streamflow was less than 9%. Assessment of water pathways and their uncertainties based on the uncertainty of estimated inputs also showed that 62% of precipitation was removed by evapotranspiration with up to 16% uncertainty. The methods introduced in this study can be applied to other data-scarce watersheds, and findings provide insights on the hydrology of the Peruvian Andes region.

TI  - An Assessment of Drought Stress in Tea Estates Using Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the detrimental climatic factors that affects the productivity and quality of tea by limiting the growth and development of the plants. The aim of this research was to determine drought stress in tea estates using a remote sensing technique with the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images were processed to measure the land surface temperature (LST) and soil moisture index (SMI). Maps for the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and leaf area index (LAI), as well as yield maps, were developed from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The drought frequency was calculated from the classification of droughts utilizing the SPI. The results of this study show that the drought frequency for the Sylhet station was 38.46% for near-normal, 35.90% for normal, and 25.64% for moderately dry months. In contrast, the Sreemangal station demonstrated frequencies of 28.21%, 41.02%, and 30.77% for near-normal, normal, and moderately dry months, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the SMI and NDMI were 0.84, 0.77, and 0.79 for the drought periods of 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, respectively, indicating a strong relationship between soil and plant canopy moisture. The results of yield prediction with respect to drought stress in tea estates demonstrate that 61%, 60%, and 60% of estates in the study area had lower yields than the actual yield during the drought period, which accounted for 7.72%, 11.92%, and 12.52% yield losses in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. This research suggests that satellite remote sensing with the SPI could be a valuable tool for land use planners, policy makers, and scientists to measure drought stress in tea estates.

TI  - Coastal submesoscale processes and their effect on phytoplankton distribution in the southeastern Bay of Biscay
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Submesoscale processes have a determinant role in the dynamics of oceans by transporting momentum, heat, mass, and particles. Furthermore, they can define niches where different phytoplankton species flourish and accumulate not only by nutrient provisioning but also by modifying the water column structure or active gathering through advection. In coastal areas, however, submesoscale oceanic processes act together with coastal ones, and their effect on phytoplankton distribution is not straightforward. The present study brings the relevance of hydrodynamic variables, such as vorticity, into consideration in the study of phytoplankton distribution, via the analysis of in situ and remote multidisciplinary data. In situ data were obtained during the ETOILE oceanographic cruise, which surveyed the Capbreton Canyon area in the southeastern part of the Bay of Biscay in early August 2017. The main objective of this cruise was to describe the link between the occurrence and distribution of phytoplankton spectral groups and mesoscale to submesoscale ocean processes. In situ discrete hydrographic measurements and multi-spectral chlorophyll a (chl a) fluorescence profiles were obtained in selected stations, while temperature, conductivity, and in vivo chl a fluorescence were also continuously recorded at the surface. On top of these data, remote sensing data available for this area, such as high-frequency radar and satellite data, were also processed and analysed. From the joint analysis of these observations, we discuss the relative importance and effects of several environmental factors on phytoplankton spectral group distribution above and below the pycnocline and at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) by performing a set of generalized additive models (GAMS). Overall, salinity is the most important parameter modulating not only total chl a but also the contribution of the two dominant spectral groups of phytoplankton, brown and green algae groups. However, at the DCM, among the measured variables, vorticity is the main modulating environmental factor for phytoplankton distribution and explains 19.30 % of the variance. Since the observed distribution of chl a within the DCM cannot be statistically explained without the vorticity, this research sheds light on the impact of the dynamic variables in the distribution of spectral groups at high spatial resolution.

TI  - Current Landscape and Open Questions on Adjuvant Therapies in Melanoma
T2  - DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL & CONCEPTUAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that is frequently diagnosed at early stages. In most cases, surgical resection is curative. In case of thicker melanomas (> pT1b) without clinical or instrumental evidence of metastasis, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended for staging purposes. If the lymph nodes are the only site of disease (macroscopic or microscopic> 1mm), configuring stage III, the international guidelines recommend the use of adjuvant therapy with checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) or targeted therapies (dabrafenib plus trametinib). These drugs have shown a significant increase in recurrence-free survival, although some doubts and open questions remain. Specifically, none of the available treatments has shown a clear benefit in the overall survival rates, the advantages they give in stage IIIA are not well known, and finally there are still no prospective clinical studies identifying the best approach to continue the therapeutic process in case of relapse. Furthermore, there are new opportunities opening up with the upcoming results of the neoadjuvant trials that could revolutionize the treatment of clinically evident stage III melanoma.

TI  - Use of SAR images for classification of brazilian forest formations
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has a large territorial area with a large cover of vegetation and several forest typologies with different physiognomies. It is necessary to map the forest areas in the country in order to know the spatial distribution and the dynamics of each forest formation. An efficient and reliable way to obtain this information is using remote sensing techniques, and radar - SAR - imaging can be applied, which in turn has been the focus of many researchers. Thus, the objective of the present study is to gather scientific productions related to the use of radar images applied to the mapping of different forests in Brazil, analyzing the most recent approaches and classification techniques. There was a significant application of SAR images in forests of the Amazon biome, mainly for the detection of deforestation. The images of the ALOS/PALSAR L-band radar system were the most used in the mapping of forest typologies, associated to several classifier algorithms, such as: Iterated Conditional Modes, Maximum Likelihood and random forest. The data types worked in the classifications varied according to the polarimetric capacity of each image, with emphasis on the greater use of backscattering coefficients and attributes extracted from matrix decompositions. It was also observed that most studies related SAR data to those obtained by optical sensors. Therefore, the present study made it possible to gather several applications of classification techniques for the discrimination of forest formations in Brazil using microwave imaging, indicating the potentiality of the various classifiers with SAR images, and showing that radar systems are an important technology that is being used for mapping forests in the country.

TI  - Environmental risk in Northeast Brazil: estimation of burning areas in Coreau River Basin, Ceara, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to estimate the burned areas in the hydrographic basin of the Coreau River, State of Ceara, north of Northeast Brazil, which has an area of 10,633.67 km(2), through the NOAA/AVHRR satellite, between the years from 2010 and 2017. The data were acquired at the base of INPE, where they were tabulated and generated a vector file of points. A density map of the fire sources was elaborated, from which the burned areas were estimated in the watershed studied over the defined period of years. There were 1786 fire outbreaks, totaling an estimated accumulated area of 1187.66 km(2) of fires, which corresponds to 11.17% of the entire length of the hydrographic basin. The municipality of Mucambo presented a ratio of 40% of its territory comprised by the mapped fires. In relation to the conservation units, they mapped 795 hot spots in their perimeters.

TI  - Non-Parametric Statistical Approaches for Leaf Area Index Estimation from Sentinel-2 Data: A Multi-Crop Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical variable for agroecosystem monitoring, as well as a relevant state variable in crop modelling. For this reason, temporal and spatial determination of LAI are required to improve the understanding of several land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics and crop growth. Despite the large number of retrieved LAI products and the efforts to develop new and updated algorithms for LAI estimation, the available products are not yet capable of capturing site-specific variability, as requested in many agricultural applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of non-parametric approaches for multi-temporal LAI retrieval by Sentinel-2 multispectral data, in comparison with a VI-based parametric approach. For this purpose, we built a large database combining a multispectral satellite data set and ground LAI measurements collected over two growing seasons (2018 and 2019), including three crops (i.e., winter wheat, maize, and alfalfa) characterized by different growing cycles and canopy structures, and considering different agronomic conditions (i.e., at three farms in three different sites). The accuracy of parametric and non-parametric methods for LAI estimation was assessed by cross-validation (CV) at both the pixel and field levels over mixed-crop (MC) and crop-specific (CS) data sets. Overall, the non-parametric approach showed a higher accuracy of prediction at pixel level than parametric methods, and it was also observed that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) did not provide any significant difference (p-value > 0.05) between the predicted values of LAI in the MC and CS data sets, regardless of the crop. Indeed, GPR at the field level showed a cross-validated coefficient of determination (R-CV(2)) higher than 0.80 for all three crops.

We then apply a worldwide statistical correlation in space and time of these anomalies with respect to M5.5+ shallow earthquakes (USGS source) occurred in the same period. Although the data are short and cover discontinuously the period of concern, in general, the preliminary results seem to confirm those obtained with an analogous analysis on the Swarm satellite data recently published in DE SANTIS A. et al., Sci.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH AND PRECIPITATION CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY AS AN INFLUENCE FACTOR
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA-UFF
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols influence precipitation, modify the balance of Earth's energy, and alter the cloud properties. This work has been developed in the state of South Mato Grosso to study the correlation between aerosol optical depth and precipitation index, considering the relative air humidity. The monthly data of optical depth at 550 nm (AOD) come from the MODIS/TERRA sensor, and the climatological data come from CEMTEC-MS. They are considered for the period 2002-2011. The monthly values of AOD 550 nm show seasonal patterns, with minimum and maximum during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The monthly averages of AOD 550nm have been correlated with the records of precipitation and relative humidity for the state of South Mato Grosso. The analysis of Pearson's correlation for the monthly scales reveals that the UR may be the dominant influence factor in the relationship between AOD and precipitation. When partial correlation analyses are conducted for monthly rainfall data, most of the resulting negative correlations decrease or are insignificant. It happens when the UR is used as a controlling variable.

TI  - Evaluating the monetary environmental compensation over a Hydroelectric Power Plant based on opportunity cost simulation, GIS, and remote sensing images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, electricity generation comes mainly from Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP) that accounts for 65% of the national production. The establishment of a given HPP promotes significant land surface changes since vast areas are covered by the water reservoir. To mitigate such impact, a percentual of the produced energy is charged as a monetary environmental compensation (MEC). In this study, a WorldView-2 scene was used to delineate the flooded area. After, based on Landsat-5/TM and Landsat-7/ETM + scenes, we map the major land use and land cover classes before establishing an HPP in the Southern Santa Catarina Plateau (Southern Brazil). Then, based on the resulted land cover map, we address the MEC' s effectiveness by simulating in a GIS environment the opportunity costs over the productivity of the agricultural areas lost by the HPP water reservoir. Agricultural statistics databases were consulted to obtain historical values and mean productivity of corn, soybean, and beef cattle. Results show that MEC was efficient for the timeframe of 2006-2018. The opportunity cost reveals a positive benefit value of US$4,738,862.03 (R$6,123,292.25) for the directed affected municipalities. In summary, MEC was more beneficial than maintaining agricultural activities. This research brought a simple methodology of low cost to evaluate a given HPP's effectiveness, from an economic point of view, for the directed affected municipalities. The presented method can be applied to other similar enterprises and other HPPs in Brazil.

TI  - Seasonal pattern of the chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in a coastal lagoon from the southern Baja California (Mexico), described with <i>in situ</i> observations and MODIS-Aqua imagery
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to estimate, with a climatology perspective, the average seasonal pattern of phytoplankton biomass (SP-PBavg) and its distribution in Bahia Magdalena (Mexico) as a baseline to evaluate PB changes in future studies. This lagoon is in a semi-arid region, lacks river discharges, and channels with vegetation are limited at the north and south zones. SP-PBavg was estimated with chlorophyll-a (chl-a) data obtained in 21 sites on daily MODIS-Aqua imagery (2002-2013; n = 2,418) from a ready-to-use public database. The first step was to establish criteria to use imagery and validate with in situ observations taken in 14 sites (2002-2011; n = 312). MODIS-Aqua overestimated chl-a (mean +/- confidence interval(95) : 5.09 +/- 0.97 mg m(-3); n = 225); with differences among sites. There were no differences near the inlet lagoon (p <0.05), where the water characteristics are Case-1 while values were significantly higher in the eastern shore and two or three times higher in the mouth of north and south channels, whose water characteristics are similar to Case-2. Multivariate statistical methods allow defining zones into the lagoon and describe their SP-PBavg with both in situ and MODIS Aqua data, but the former's sample size was small, and the patterns were only delineated. In the inlet surroundings, chl-a peaks from March/April to June/July. On the eastern shore, where MODIS Aqua and in situ data were correlated, despite concentration differences, chla is higher from March/April to October, with peaks in June and September. In the mouth of internal channels, chl-a was higher than other sites and during a longer period; however, the very high MODIS-Aqua values suggest that the satellite also detects organic matter supplied by phytoplankton and other vegetables, which explain the high lagoon's productivity. These results validate the use of MODIS Aqua imagery to describe the chl-a seasonal patterns in the sea's vicinity. (C) 2021 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, with increasing incidence worldwide. This review intends to propose a comprehensive evaluation of MCC epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenetic mechanisms, diagnosis, and therapies. A section is dedicated to immunological aspects and another to the involvement of angiogenesis and angiogenic growth factors in MCC progression, proposing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Advanced MCC tumors have been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors with effective results. Therefore, the state of art of this immunotherapy is also examined, reporting on the most recent clinical trials in the field. We conclude by underlining the achievements in the understanding of MCC pathology and indicating the present needs for effective diagnosis and therapeutic management of the disease.

TI  - Exploring the Impacts and Temporal Variations of Different Building Roof Types on Surface Urban Heat Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the impact of different types of building roofs on urban heat islands. This was carried out using building roof data from remotely sensed Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) imagery. The roofs captured included white surface, blue steel, dark metal, other dark material, and residential roofs; these roofs were compared alongside three natural land covers (i.e., forest trees, grassland, and water). We also collected ancillary data including building height, building density, and distance to the city center. The impacts of various building roofs on land surface temperature (LST) were examined by analyzing their correlation and temporal variations. First, we examined the LST characteristics of five building roof types and three natural land covers using boxplots and variance analysis with post hoc tests. Then, multivariate regression analysis was used to explore the impact of building roofs on LST. There were three key findings in the results. First, the mean LSTs for five different building roofs statistically differed from each other; these differences were more significant during the hot season than the cool season. Second, the impact of the five types of roofs on LSTs varied considerably from each other. Lastly, the contribution of the five roof types to LST variance was more substantial during the cool season. These findings unveil specific urban heat retention drivers, in which different types of building roofs are one such driver. The outcomes from this research may help policymakers develop more effective strategies to address the surface urban heat island phenomenon and its related health concerns.

TI  - A Review of Satellite Missions and Forest Cover Classification Methods Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in remote sensing technologies enables increasing achievements in the field of tree species classification. In recent years, significant technological progress and improvements in the characteristics of optical sensors have been made, thus enabling improved resolution of details on satellite imagery (spatial, spectral and radiometric resolution). The increase in spatial resolution had a significant impact on the development of remote sensing techniques and methods. A new generation of very high resolution satellite imagery enables research at local and regional levels and represent a important source of forestry information. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of global high and very high resolution satellite missions, as well as analysis and processing methodology in forest cover classification. In combination with machine learning algorithms, the application of high and very high resolution satellite imageries reduces the need for labor-intensive and time-consuming traditional field methods while increasing the quantitative and qualitative value of the information obtained in forestry.

TI  - Forecasting shoreline changes along the Egyptian Nile Delta coast using Landsat image series and Geographic Information System
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Before construction of the Aswan High Dam, the Nile Delta was expanding and advancing into the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, it became a highly destructive Delta due to the lack of sediment discharge, climate change, subsidence, and coastal processes (e.g. wind, waves, tides, and littoral currents). Many coastal structures have been erected to stop or mitigate coastal problems in the study area. We used 31 Landsat images to monitor the fluctuation of erosion and deposition along the study area. The shorelines in these huge datasets were extracted using standard techniques. Linear regression ratio (LRR) and end-point rate (EPR) were used with Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software to determine the rates of beach changes; we then forecast future shoreline changes. The accuracy of the model's results was checked using the ground field measurements of several studies. This model also creates an estimate of the position uncertainty at each time step. The value of the uncertainty is low (approximately half a pixel) along the shorelines without coastal protection. This study aimed to forecast future beach evolution to the year 2041 to evaluate its sensibility and facilitate proposals for coastal protection for human safety and habitats if the coastal processes and climate change continue to worsen with time.

TI  - PET/MRI for Staging the Axilla in Breast Cancer: Current Evidence and the Rationale for SNB vs. PET/MRI Trials
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary PET/MRI is a relatively new, hybrid imaging tool that allows practitioners to obtain both a local and systemic staging in breast cancer patients in a single exam. To date, the available evidence is not sufficient to determine the role of PET/MRI in breast cancer management. The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of the current literature on PET/MRI in breast cancer, and to illustrate two ongoing trials aimed at defining the eventual role of PET/MRI in axillary staging in two different settings: patients with early breast cancer and patients with positive axillary nodes that are candidates for primary systemic therapy. In both cases, findings from PET/MRI will be compared with the final pathology and could be helpful to better tailor axillary surgery in the future. Axillary surgery in breast cancer (BC) is no longer a therapeutic procedure but has become a purely staging procedure. The progressive improvement in imaging techniques has paved the way to the hypothesis that prognostic information on nodal status deriving from surgery could be obtained with an accurate diagnostic exam. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) is a relatively new imaging tool and its role in breast cancer patients is still under investigation. We reviewed the available literature on PET/MRI in BC patients. This overview showed that PET/MRI yields a high diagnostic performance for the primary tumor and distant lesions of liver, brain and bone. In particular, the results of PET/MRI in staging the axilla are promising. This provided the rationale for two prospective comparative trials between axillary surgery and PET/MRI that could lead to a further de-escalation of surgical treatment of BC. center dot SNB vs. PET/MRI 1 trial compares PET/MRI and axillary surgery in staging the axilla of BC patients undergoing primary systemic therapy (PST). center dot SNB vs. PET/MRI 2 trial compares PET/MRI and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in staging the axilla of early BC patients who are candidates for upfront surgery. Finally, these ongoing studies will help clarify the role of PET/MRI in BC and establish whether it represents a useful diagnostic tool that could guide, or ideally replace, axillary surgery in the future.

TI  - Evaluation of Two Vegetation Indices (NDVI and VCI) Over Asi Basin in Turkey
T2  - TEKNIK DERGI
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and global warming are among the issues that humanity is most concerned about the future. The growing drought and flood risks that increase despite the taken measures have led to the adoption of an integrated understanding on the topic of water management in recent years. To manage the increased risk of drought and to make sustainable planning, the dimensions of drought should be known first. For this purpose, many drought indices have been developed. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which determined by remote sensing, are two of these. In this study, in which the agricultural drought was analyzed with vegetation indices by taking into consideration the historical drought archive, the Asi Basin was addressed. The data of the Asi Basin, which covers an area of 7800 km(2) and was obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellites, was used in this study. With the satellites benefited in remote sensing and with the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE), where the layers of vegetation were determined, agricultural and forest areas were evaluated separately. The vegetation indices, which change with the increase in temperature, have revealed the necessity of a long-term drought management for the Asi Basin. Result of the work pointed that NDVI index is more appropriated to the Asi Basin than the VCI index to monitor drought.

TI  - Cognition of Graphical Notation for Processing Data in ERDAS IMAGINE
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an evaluation of the ERDAS IMAGINE Spatial Model Editor from the perspective of effective cognition. Workflow models designed in Spatial Model Editor are used for the automatic processing of remote sensing data. The process steps are designed as a chain of operations in the workflow model. The functionalities of the Spatial Model Editor and the visual vocabulary are both important for users. The cognitive quality of the visual vocabulary increases the comprehension of workflows during creation and utilization. The visual vocabulary influences the user's exploitation of workflow models. The complex Physics of Notations theory was applied to the visual vocabulary on ERDAS IMAGINE Spatial Model Editor. The results were supplemented and verified using the eye-tracking method. The evaluation of user gaze and the movement of the eyes above workflow models brought real insight into the user's cognition of the model. The main findings are that ERDAS Spatial Model Editor mostly fulfils the requirements for effective cognition of visual vocabulary. Namely, the semantic transparency and dual coding of symbols are very high, according to the Physics of Notations theory. The semantic transparency and perceptual discriminability of the symbols are verified through eye-tracking. The eye-tracking results show that the curved connector lines adversely affect the velocity of reading and produce errors. The application of the Physics of Notations theory and the eye-tracking method provides a useful evaluation of graphical notation as well as recommendations for the user design of workflow models in their practice.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Stages of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Using the Receptor-Targeted Radiotracer <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Tilmanocept
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Neck management in patients with early-stage, clinically node-negative oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a matter of discussion. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) represents a treatment alternative to avoid elective neck dissection (END) in this cohort and different protocols and tracers exist. Here we present the clinical outcome of SLNB using Tc-99m-tilmanocept in a two-day protocol in patients suffering from early-stage OSCC. A total of 13 patients (males: 6; females: 7; mean age: 65.7 years, ranging from 47 to 89 years) were included in this study. Most of the patients suffered from an OSCC of the floor of mouth (n = 6), followed by tongue (n = 5) and upper alveolar crest/hard palate (n = 2). Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were successfully identified in all cases (range: 1-7). The average length of hospital stay was 4.7 days (range: 3-8 days) and mean duration of surgical intervention was 121 min (range: 74-233 min). One patient who suffered from an OSCC of the tongue was sentinel lymph node positive (SLN+). The mean follow-up for all sentinel lymph node negative (SLN-) patients (n = 12) was 20.3 months (range: 10-28 months). No local or nodal recurrences were observed within the observation period. In our patient cohort, SLNB using Tc-99m-tilmanocept in a two-day protocol proved to be a reliable and safe staging method for patients suffering from early-stage, clinically node-negative OSCC. These results and their possible superiority to colloid tracers have to be confirmed in a prospective randomized controlled study.

TI  - Testudines as Sentinels for Monitoring the Dissemination of Antibiotic Resistance in Marine Environments: An Integrative Review
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Dissemination of antibiotic resistance (AR) in marine environments is a global concern with a propensity to affect public health and many ecosystems worldwide. We evaluated the use of sea turtles as sentinel species for monitoring AR in marine environments. In this field, antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been commonly identified by using standard culture and sensitivity tests, leading to an overrepresentation of specific, culturable bacterial classes in the available literature. AR was detected against all major antibiotic classes, but the highest cumulative global frequency of resistance in all represented geographical sites was against the beta-lactam class by a two-fold difference compared to all other antibiotics. Wastewater facilities and turtle rehabilitation centres were associated with higher incidences of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) accounting for an average of 58% and 49% of resistant isolates, respectively. Furthermore, a relatively similar prevalence of MDRB was seen in all studied locations. These data suggest that anthropogenically driven selection pressures for the development of AR in sea turtles and marine environments are relatively similar worldwide. There is a need, however, to establish direct demonstrable associations between AR in sea turtles in their respective marine environments with wastewater facilities and other anthropogenic activities worldwide.

TI  - Distinguishing Original and Non-Original Stands at the Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve (PR China): Remote Sensing and GIS for Conservation and Ecological Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research developed a novel methodological framework to differentiate natural mangrove stands (i.e., original), from stands which were planted and stands naturally established after interaction between planted and non-planted stands (e.g., through pollination, i.e., non-original). Ground-truth and remote sensing data were collected for Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve (ZMNNR) in P.R. China. First, satellite images of Corona (1967) and GeoEye-1 (2009) were overlaid to identify original (1967) and non-original (2009) mangrove stands. Second, in both stands a total of 75 in situ plots (25 m(2)) were measured for ground-truthing of tree structural parameters including height, density, basal area and Complexity Index (CI). From temporal satellite data, we identify 236.12 ha of original mangrove and 567.88 ha of non-original mangrove in the reserve. Averaged measurements of the original mangrove stands, i.e., stem density (1164 nos. 0.1 ha(-1)), basal area (90.3 m(2) 0.1 ha(-1)) and CI (100.59), indicated that they were in a state of maturity and less disturbed compared to the non-original mangroves (density, 1241 nos. 0.1 ha(-1); basal area, 4.92 m(2) 0.1 ha(-1) and CI, 55.65). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differentiation between the original and non-original mangrove tree structural parameters: Kandelia obovata's density, X-2 = 34.78, d.f. = 1, p = 0.001; basal area, X-2 = 108.15, d.f. = 1, p = 0.001; Rizhopora stylosa's density, X-2 = 64.03, d.f. = 1, p = 0.001; basal area, X-2 = 117.96, d.f. = 1, p = 0.001. The latter is also evident from the clustering plots generated from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Vegetation dynamics at the ZMNNR also enabled us to compare the species composition and distribution patterns with other Indo-West Pacific regions. Overall, the present study not only highlights the advantage of >50 years old satellite data but also provide a benchmark for future ecological research, conservation and management of the ZMNNR.

TI  - Multisensor Data Fusion for Cloud Removal in Global and All-Season Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of optical observations acquired via spaceborne Earth imagery are affected by clouds. While there is numerous prior work on reconstructing cloud-covered information, previous studies are, oftentimes, confined to narrowly defined regions of interest, raising the question of whether an approach can generalize to a diverse set of observations acquired at variable cloud coverage or in different regions and seasons. We target the challenge of generalization by curating a large novel data set for training new cloud removal approaches and evaluate two recently proposed performance metrics of image quality and diversity. Our data set is the first publically available to contain a global sample of coregistered radar and optical observations, cloudy and cloud-free. Based on the observation that cloud coverage varies widely between clear skies and absolute coverage, we propose a novel model that can deal with either extreme and evaluate its performance on our proposed data set. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of training models on real over synthetic data, underlining the need for a carefully curated data set of real observations. To facilitate future research, our data set is made available online.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Different DEM Sources and Geomorphology on Flash Flood Analysis in Hyper-Arid Deserts
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the cornerstone for hydrological and geomorphological modeling. Herein, two Nile-tributary catchments (Wadi Al Rishrash and Wadi Atfeh) in Egypt are selected to examine the contribution of different DEMs to the accuracy of hydrological and geomorphological analyses in the hyper-arid Sahara. DEMs sources include: Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) (12.5 m resolution), ALOS World 3D with 30 m resolution (AW3D30), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER DEM with 30 m resolution) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM with 30 and 90 m resolution), in addition to topographic map-derived DEM (90 m resolution). Using a hypothetical uniformly-distributed 10 mm rainfall event, the estimated parameters, including: flow duration, time to peak and peak discharge rates, are almost similar for the different DEMs and thus technical aspects related to sources and resolutions of the datasets impose insignificant control on quantitative flash-flood analyses. Conversely, variations in geological and geomorphological characteristics of the catchments show more significant control on the hydrograph magnitudes as indicated by the different parameters of the two catchments. These findings indicate that understanding the geological and hydrological evolution of the catchment is essential for integrated management strategies of floods especially in the Saharan-Arabian deserts and in similar conditions of hyper-aridity and scarce in situ data worldwide.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature in Response to Land Use/Cover Change Based on Remote Sensing Data and GIS Techniques: Application to Saiss Plain, Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to analyze the impact of land use and land cover change on land surface temperature (LST), remote sensing is the most appropriate tool. Land use/cover change has been confirmed to have a significant impact on climate through various aspects that modulate LST and precipitation. However, there are no studies which illustrate this link in the Fez-Meknes region using satellite observations. Thus, the aim of this study was to monitor LST as a function of the land use change in the Saiss plain. In the study, 12 Landsat images of the year 2019 (one image per month) were used to represent the variation of LST during the year, and 2 images per year in 1988, 1999 and 2009 to study the interannual variation in LST. The mapping results showed that the land use/cover in the region has undergone a significant evolution; an increase in the arboriculture and urbanized areas to detriment of arable lands and rangelands. On the basis of statistical analyses, LST varies during the phases of plant growth in all seasons and that it is diversified due to the positional influence of land use type. The relationship between LST and NDVI shows a negative correlation (LST decreases when NDVI increases). This explains the increase in LST in rangelands and arable land, while it decreases in irrigated crops and arboriculture.

TI  - Linking Remotely Sensed Carbon and Water Use Efficiencies with In Situ Soil Properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is expected to be altered by climate change and CO2 fertilization, but this projection is limited by our understanding of how the soil system interacts with plants. Understanding the soil-vegetation interactions is essential to assess the magnitude and response of terrestrial ecosystems to the changing climate. Here, we used soil profile and satellite data to explore the role that soil properties play in regulating water and carbon use by plants. Data obtained for 19 terrestrial ecosystem sites in a warm temperate and humid climate were used to investigate the relationship between remotely sensed data and soil physical and chemical properties. Classification and regression tree results showed that in situ soil carbon isotope (delta C-13), and soil order were significant predictors (r(2) = 0.39, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0 of 0.175 gC/KgH(2)O) of remotely sensed water use efficiency (WUE) based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Soil extractable calcium (Ca), and land cover type were significant predictors of remotely sensed carbon use efficiency (CUE) based on MODIS and Landsat data-(r(2) = 0.64-0.78, MAE = 0.04-0.06). We used gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) data, based on the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), to calculate WUE and CUE (referred to as WUESIF and CUESIF, respectively) for our study sites. The regression tree analysis revealed that soil organic matter and soil extractable magnesium (Mg), delta C-13, and soil silt content were the important predictors of both WUESIF (r(2) = 0.19, MAE = 0.64 gC/KgH(2)O) and CUESIF (r(2) = 0.45, MAE = 0.1), respectively. Our results revealed the importance of soil extractable Ca, soil carbon ((SC)-C-13 is a facet of soil carbon content), and soil organic matter predicting CUE and WUE. Insights gained from this study highlighted the importance of biotic and abiotic factors regulating plant and soil interactions. These types of data are timely and critical for accurate predictions of how terrestrial ecosystems respond to climate change.

TI  - Combined Geodetic and Seismological Study of the December 2020 M<sub>w</sub>=4.6 Thiva (Central Greece) Shallow Earthquake
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 2 December 2020, a moderate and shallow M-w = 4.6 earthquake occurred in Boeotia (Central Greece) near the city of Thiva. Despite its magnitude, the co-seismic ground deformation field was detectable and measurable by Sentinel-1, ascending and descending, synthetic aperture interferometry radar (InSAR) acquisitions. The closest available GNSS station to the epicenter, located 11 km west, measured no deformation, as expected. We proceeded to the inversion of the deformation source. Moreover, we reassessed seismological data to identify the activated zone, associated with the mainshock and the aftershock sequence. Additionally, we used the rupture plane information from InSAR to better determine the focal mechanism and the centroid location of the mainshock. We observed that the mainshock occurred at a shallower depth and the rupture then expanded downdip, as revealed by the aftershock distribution. Our geodetic inversion modelling indicated the activation of a normal fault with a small left-lateral component, length of 2.0 km, width of 1.7 km, average slip of 0.2 m, a low dip angle of 33 degrees, and a SW dip-direction. The inferred fault top was buried at a depth of similar to 0.5 km, rooted at a depth of similar to 1.4 km, with its geodetic centroid buried at 1.0 km. It was aligned with the Kallithea fault. In addition, the dip-up projection of the modeled fault to the surface was located very close (similar to 0.4 km SW) to the mapped (by existing geological observations) trace of the Kallithea fault. The ruptured area was settled in a transition zone. We suggest the installation of at least one GNSS and seismological station near Kallithea; as the activated zone (inferred by the aftershock sequence and InSAR results) could yield events with M >= 5.0, according to empirical laws relating to rupture zone dimensions and earthquake magnitude.

AB  - Sumptuary laws-laws that regulated displays of status through clothing, hairstyles, armor, and other visual markers-were enacted across Europe with increasing frequency beginning in the late thirteenth century. Sumptuary laws from the English colony in Ireland, promulgated from 1297 onward, have never been analyzed as a distinct corpus of law nor interpreted in the wider European context. Comparison of the Irish laws with their European counterparts highlights the markers of status that lawmakers in the colony were most anxious to preserve. Irish laws share the same core concern that prompted most sumptuary law: that a person's position in society was faithfully reflected in their appearance. They differ markedly from much European material, however, in the types of status with which they were primarily concerned. They rarely addressed, for example, the attire of women or sought to restrain expenditure. Most notably, in Europe the signaling of rank and social status was the main concern of sumptuary laws, while in Ireland differentiation by ethnicity was the primary focus. The relative inattention to social status in the Irish laws relates to several economic and societal factors but also reflects the centrality of ethnic division between English and Irish to the worldview of lawmakers in the colony.

TI  - Update on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Surgical Staging of Endometrial Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged as an alternative staging approach in women with assumed early-stage endometrial carcinoma. Through image-guided surgery and pathologic ultrastaging, the SLN approach is introducing "precision medicine" to the surgical management of gynecologic cancers, providing a comprehensive evaluation of high-yield lymph nodes. This approach improves the surgeons' ability to detect small-volume metastatic disease while reducing intraoperative and postoperative morbidity associated with lymphadenectomy. Although the majority of clinicians in Europe and the USA have recognized the value of SLN biopsy in endometrial carcinoma and introduced this as part of clinical practice, there is ongoing debate regarding its role in very low-risk patients as well as in patients at high risk of nodal metastasis. The significance of low-volume metastasis is not fully understood, and there is no consensus in regard to how the presence of isolated tumor cells should guide adjuvant therapy. Standardized protocols for histopathologic evaluation of SLNs are lacking. In this review article we aim to provide a framework for the introduction of SLN biopsy in endometrial cancer, give an updated overview of the existing literature, as well as discuss potential controversies and unanswered questions regarding this approach and future directions.

TI  - Long-Term Hindcasts of Wheat Yield in Fields Using Remotely Sensed Phenology, Climate Data and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing offers a cost-effective means of generating long-term hindcasts of yield that can be used to understand how yield varies in time and space. This study investigated the use of remotely sensed phenology, climate data and machine learning for estimating yield at a resolution suitable for optimising crop management in fields. We used spatially weighted growth curve estimation to identify the timing of phenological events from sequences of Landsat NDVI and derive phenological and seasonal climate metrics. Using data from a 17,000 ha study area, we investigated the relationships between the metrics and yield over 17 years from 2003 to 2019. We compared six statistical and machine learning models for estimating yield: multiple linear regression, mixed effects models, generalised additive models, random forests, support vector regression using radial basis functions and deep learning neural networks. We used a 50-50 train-test split on paddock-years where 50% of paddock-year combinations were randomly selected and used to train each model and the remaining 50% of paddock-years were used to assess the model accuracy. Using only phenological metrics, accuracy was highest using a linear mixed model with a random effect that allowed the relationship between integrated NDVI and yield to vary by year (R-2 = 0.67, MAE = 0.25 t ha(-1), RMSE = 0.33 t ha(-1), NRMSE = 0.25). We quantified the improvements in accuracy when seasonal climate metrics were also used as predictors. We identified two optimal models using the combined phenological and seasonal climate metrics: support vector regression and deep learning models (R-2 = 0.68, MAE = 0.25 t ha(-1), RMSE = 0.32 t ha(-1), NRMSE = 0.25). While the linear mixed model using only phenological metrics performed similarly to the nonlinear models that are also seasonal climate metrics, the nonlinear models can be more easily generalised to estimate yield in years for which training data are unavailable. We conclude that long-term hindcasts of wheat yield in fields, at 30 m spatial resolution, can be produced using remotely sensed phenology from Landsat NDVI, climate data and machine learning.

TI  - Deficit Irrigation Strategies on Tree Physiological and Chemical Properties: Treatment Effects, Prediction Based Model Analyses and Inter-Correlations
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is a key factor for different physiological aspects of fruit trees. Therefore, such irrigation protocols that can save water consumption during irrigation and maintain fruit trees productivity are an essential goal especially under semiarid climate conditions. The aim of this 3-year apricot study was to investigate the effect of four deficit irrigation (DI) treatments (control, moderate regulated deficit irrigation: RDIm, severe RDI: RDIs and continuous DI: CDI) on 15 tree physiological properties (chilling requirement-CR, heat requirement-HR, days from end-dormancy until fruit harvest-DEDFH, sum of growing degree days-sGDD, total number of buds-TNB, number of flower buds-NFB, number of vegetative buds-NVB, starting date of flowering-SDF, number of opened flower buds-NOFB, flower bud abscission-FBA, fruit set-FS, seasonal vegetative growth-SVG, fruit number per tree-FNT, fruit weight-FW, fruit yield-FY), and on two tree chemical properties (total soluble carbohydrates-TSC and total proline content-TPC) on apricot cultivars 'Ninfa' and 'Canino' in Egypt. Results showed that both DI treatments and cultivars significantly influenced the values of CR, HR, TNB, SDF, NOFB, FS, SVG, FNT, FY, TSC, and TPC. Values of FBA were significantly affected by years and DI treatments, while sGDD by years and cultivars. Values of DEDFH, NFB, and FW were significantly influenced only by cultivars, while NVB only by DI treatments. The RDIm treatment gave the most acceptable values for most measured properties compared to the fully irrigated control treatment. Prediction based model analysis demonstrated that generalized linear models (GLMs) can be predictors for the measured tree properties in the DI treatments. The best goodness-of-fit of the predicted GLMs was reached for HR, NOFB, FS, SVG, FNT, TSC, and TPC. In all the four DI treatments, 22 pair-variables (TNB versus (vs.) NFB, TNB vs. NOFB, TNB vs. NOFB, NFB vs. NOFB, NFB vs. FNT, NFB vs. FY, NFB vs. FW, NOFB vs. SVG, NOFB vs. FNT, NOFB vs. FY, FS vs. FNT, FS vs. FY, SVG vs. FNT, SVG vs. FY, SVG vs. TSC, FNT vs. FY, FY vs. FW, CR vs. TSC, HR vs. TNB, HR vs. NFB, HR vs. FNT, HR vs. FY, and NOFB vs. FBA) correlated significantly in Pearson correlation and regression analyses. Principal component analyses explained 82% of the total variance and PC1, PC2, and PC3 explained 23, 21, and 15% of the total variance and correlated with the HR, TNB, FS, FNT and FY; FBA, SVG, TSC, and TPC; and NFB, NVB and NOFB, respectively, indicating strong connections among tree physiological and chemical properties. In conclusion, DI techniques using moderate water deficits can be managed successfully in apricot production under semiarid Mediterranean climate conditions such as the one in Egypt.

TI  - The January 11, 2018, M<sub>w</sub> 6.0 Bago-Yoma, Myanmar Earthquake: A Shallow Thrust Event Within the Deforming Bago-Yoma Range
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - On January 11, 2018 (18:26 UTC), a M-w 6.0 earthquake occurred approximately 30 km west of the Sagaing Fault in the Bago-Yoma Range (BYR). Using a local broadband seismic network and regional seismic stations, we refine the locations and moment tensors of the earthquake sequence. We relocate 98 earthquake epicenters and determine the focal mechanism and centroid depth of the mainshock and 20 aftershocks with M-w > 4. The relocated epicenters cluster in a NW-SE direction that is consistent with the strike of the mainshock fault plane solution and the slip distribution derived from ALOS-2 interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations. Most of the aftershocks have a pure thrust focal mechanism similar to the mainshock, except for four strike-slip aftershocks. The refined locations and moment tensors of the thrust events clearly delineate a fault dipping similar to 40 degrees to the southwest at a depth range of 3-7 km, indicating that the earthquake sequence ruptured a previously unmapped, active fault. We interpret the earthquake sequence to be associated with pre-existing faults within the BYR anticlinorium. This earthquake sequence and historical seismicity indicate that the upper crust of the BYR is highly stressed, resulting in ongoing distributed deformation between the oblique Rakhine megathrust and the dextral Sagaing Fault. The seismic hazard posed by these active faults has been increasing with the development of infrastructure such as dams within the BYR. Our study highlights the need for high-resolution earthquake source parameter and strong ground motion attenuation studies for further understanding of the neotectonics of Myanmar and its related seismic hazard.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Mapping of Crops Supported by Improved CASA Model and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The net primary productivity (NPP) and aboveground biomass mapping of crops based on remote sensing technology are not only conducive to understanding the growth and development of crops but can also be used to monitor timely agricultural information, thereby providing effective decision making for agricultural production management. To solve the saturation problem of the NDVI in the aboveground biomass mapping of crops, the original CASA model was improved using narrow-band red-edge information, which is sensitive to vegetation chlorophyll variation, and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), NPP, and aboveground biomass of winter wheat and maize were mapped in the main growing seasons. Moreover, in this study, we deeply analyzed the seasonal change trends of crops' biophysical parameters in terms of the NDVI, FPAR, actual light use efficiency (LUE), and their influence on aboveground biomass. Finally, to analyze the uncertainty of the aboveground biomass mapping of crops, we further discussed the inversion differences of FPAR with different vegetation indices. The results demonstrated that the inversion accuracies of the FPAR of the red-edge normalized vegetation index (NDVIred-edge) and red-edge simple ratio vegetation index (SRred-edge) were higher than those of the original CASA model. Compared with the reference data, the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimated by the improved CASA model was 0.73 and 0.70, respectively, which was 0.21 and 0.13 higher than that of the original CASA model. In addition, the analysis of the FPAR inversions of different vegetation indices showed that the inversion accuracies of the red-edge vegetation indices NDVIred-edge and SRred-edge were higher than those of the other vegetation indices, which confirmed that the vegetation indices involving red-edge information can more effectively retrieve FPAR and aboveground biomass of crops.

TI  - Current Wildland Fire Patterns and Challenges in Europe: A Synthesis of National Perspectives
T2  - AIR SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Changes in climate, land use, and land management impact the occurrence and severity of wildland fires in many parts of the world. This is particularly evident in Europe, where ongoing changes in land use have strongly modified fire patterns over the last decades. Although satellite data by the European Forest Fire Information System provide large-scale wildland fire statistics across European countries, there is still a crucial need to collect and summarize in-depth local analysis and understanding of the wildland fire condition and associated challenges across Europe. This article aims to provide a general overview of the current wildland fire patterns and challenges as perceived by national representatives, supplemented by national fire statistics (2009-2018) across Europe. For each of the 31 countries included, we present a perspective authored by scientists or practitioners from each respective country, representing a wide range of disciplines and cultural backgrounds. The authors were selected from members of the COST Action "Fire and the Earth System: Science & Society" funded by the European Commission with the aim to share knowledge and improve communication about wildland fire. Where relevant, a brief overview of key studies, particular wildland fire challenges a country is facing, and an overview of notable recent fire events are also presented. Key perceived challenges included (1) the lack of consistent and detailed records for wildland fire events, within and across countries, (2) an increase in wildland fires that pose a risk to properties and human life due to high population densities and sprawl into forested regions, and (3) the view that, irrespective of changes in management, climate change is likely to increase the frequency and impact of wildland fires in the coming decades. Addressing challenge (1) will not only be valuable in advancing national and pan-European wildland fire management strategies, but also in evaluating perceptions (2) and (3) against more robust quantitative evidence.

TI  - Multispacecraft Current Density Estimates in the Low- and Mid-Latitude F-Region Ionosphere Using the Swarm Constellation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new application of a multispacecraft method which provides estimates of the full electric current density vector in the ionospheric low- and mid-latitude F region. The method uses the three satellites of the Swarm constellation in configurations when they were close to each other. The current density is calculated inside triangular prisms defined by the satellite positions. The technique is inspired by similar approaches such as the curlometer. Here, we propose an alternative mathematical treatment, which involves the use of the well-known curl-B technique and a least squares minimization. The proposed formalism provides a rigorous way to propagate the errors through the problem and special care is taken to validate the algorithm and assess the relevance of the derived currents. Such techniques are powerful tools to study the F-region ionosphere currents as they naturally exclude all the other contributions outside the considered volumes. The F region is known to host currents with a complex spatiotemporal variability. Besides the intrinsic interest of this system itself, understanding the dynamics of these currents is also critical for global geomagnetic field modeling as they are an important source of error in the models. In this paper, we present the full algorithm and test the method on both synthetic and real Swarm satellite data on February 15, 2014. Several sources of error are investigated. Additionally, the results reveal expected characteristics of F-region interhemispheric field-aligned currents. Some new characteristics of F-region currents, potentially associated with dynamo and pressure currents, are also observed.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Air Pollution in Poland Based on Surface Measurements and Satellite Data
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its first detection in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus has become a global pandemic within just three months. The Polish government declared a state of emergency on March 14, 2020, which was connected with the adoption of a number of measures aimed to prevent the spread of the virus. These restrictive measures have led to improvements in air quality throughout the country. Therefore, evaluation of the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and related government measures to constrain its spread is crucial to define its impact on air pollution. During this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used along with tropospheric NO2 and SO2 vertical column densities from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The data on ground-based concentrations of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2) obtained from air quality monitoring stations were also considered to assess changes in aerosols and air pollutants connected with the cessation of various kinds of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to preventive measures for COVID-19. In large cities of the country, the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were reduced in the range from -5.1% to -35.5%, from -8.3% to -33.1% and from -0.4% to -18.8%. In addition, satellite data for NO2 and SO2 also indicate a decrease in concentration across the country by -10.8% and -25.6% during the COVID-19 restrictions period. The lockdown events may play a vital role as a potential solution to reduce air pollution in future as it may not be uncommon for governments to introduce deliberately selective hotspot lockdowns to control pollution levels.

AB  - A broadband model is developed for simulating the shortwave solar radiation transfer in the Earth's atmosphere for spectral channels of Sentinel-2A satellite radiometers. This model is based on line-by-line calculations of absorption spectra with the use of modern spectroscopic information and following parameterization of the radiation transmission functions in the form of short exponential series, which allows one to apply the standard discrete-ordinate method to solution of the radiative transfer equation for each exponential component. The errors in the spectral reflectance of the surface due to uncertainties of aerosol extinction in Sentinel-2A channels are estimated for typical optical-meteorological conditions of the Lower Volga region.

TI  - Improving Imbalanced Land Cover Classification with K-Means SMOTE: Detecting and Oversampling Distinctive Minority Spectral Signatures
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are a critical tool to support informed policy development, planning, and resource management decisions. With significant upsides, the automatic production of Land Use/Land Cover maps has been a topic of interest for the remote sensing community for several years, but it is still fraught with technical challenges. One such challenge is the imbalanced nature of most remotely sensed data. The asymmetric class distribution impacts negatively the performance of classifiers and adds a new source of error to the production of these maps. In this paper, we address the imbalanced learning problem, by using K-means and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) as an improved oversampling algorithm. K-means SMOTE improves the quality of newly created artificial data by addressing both the between-class imbalance, as traditional oversamplers do, but also the within-class imbalance, avoiding the generation of noisy data while effectively overcoming data imbalance. The performance of K-means SMOTE is compared to three popular oversampling methods (Random Oversampling, SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE) using seven remote sensing benchmark datasets, three classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Classifier) and three evaluation metrics using a five-fold cross-validation approach with three different initialization seeds. The statistical analysis of the results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the remaining oversamplers producing higher quality land cover classifications. These results suggest that LULC data can benefit significantly from the use of more sophisticated oversamplers as spectral signatures for the same class can vary according to geographical distribution.

AB  - With this article we intend, first, to demonstrate that every mimetic gesture undertaken by literature, every artistic form, is also the expression of a mode of subjectivity, as well as revealing a worldview. Then, that it would be mainly through formal aspects, and not necessarily discursive, that literature captures and represents reality more complexly, which in turn must be understood in a more subjective and less factual sense. Finally, reconciling the reaffirmation of the formal expressiveness of literature with a more subjective and complex conception of reality, we problematize the possibility of literature producing a less conclusive, assertive and much more autoironic, admittedly paradoxical, inconclusive and much more autoironic type of knowledge in relation to the world. metaphorical.

TI  - Eating Near the Dump: Identification of Nearby Plastic Hotspot as a Proxy for Potential Microplastic Contamination in the Norwegian Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic waste dumped in the marine environment has severe ecological, social and economic impacts. In recent years, a series of scientific studies documented the contamination by macroplastic and its impact on marine organisms through the accidental ingestion of microplastics, which also originate from the degradation of macroplastic. However, the relationship between the spatial distribution of marine litter and the ingestion of plastics by organisms have never been related. In this work, we aimed to investigate, through a modeling approach, the relations between potential sources of microplastic particles (i.e., seafloor macroplastic accumulation hotspots detected by means of trawl surveys), and the ingestion by the benthic crustacean Norwegian lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). According to the literature, N. norvegicus is characterized by a sedentary behavior and therefore it has been highlighted as a proficient sentinel species for local microplastic contamination. Despite no significant relation has been found between microplastic ingestion and the local presence of seafloor macroplastic, it seems that proximity to hotspots of macroplastic accumulation is significantly related to microplastics ingestion. These results highlight important considerations on the fate of plastic in the marine environments with significant impacts on biota and the quality of the product caught at sea.

TI  - Sentinel 2 Time Series Analysis with 3D Feature Pyramid Network and Time Domain Class Activation Intervals for Crop Mapping
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we provide an innovative contribution in the research domain dedicated to crop mapping by exploiting the of Sentinel-2 satellite images time series, with the specific aim to extract information on "where and when" crops are grown. The final goal is to set up a workflow able to reliably identify (classify) the different crops that are grown in a given area by exploiting an end-to-end (3+2)D convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. The method also has the ambition to provide information, at pixel level, regarding the period in which a given crop is cultivated during the season. To this end, we propose a solution called Class Activation Interval (CAI) which allows us to interpret, for each pixel, the reasoning made by CNN in the classification determining in which time interval, of the input time series, the class is likely to be present or not. Our experiments, using a public domain dataset, show that the approach is able to accurately detect crop classes with an overall accuracy of about 93% and that the network can detect discriminatory time intervals in which crop is cultivated. These results have twofold importance: (i) demonstrate the ability of the network to correctly interpret the investigated physical process (i.e., bare soil condition, plant growth, senescence and harvesting according to specific cultivated variety) and (ii) provide further information to the end-user (e.g., the presence of crops and its temporal dynamics).

TI  - Global Analysis of the Relationship between Reconstructed Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and Gross Primary Production (GPP)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is increasingly known as an effective proxy for plant photosynthesis, and therefore, has great potential in monitoring gross primary production (GPP). However, the relationship between SIF and GPP remains highly uncertain across space and time. Here, we analyzed the SIF (reconstructed, SIFc)-GPP relationships and their spatiotemporal variability, using GPP estimates from FLUXNET2015 and two spatiotemporally contiguous SIFc datasets (CSIF and GOSIF). The results showed that SIFc had significant positive correlations with GPP at the spatiotemporal scales investigated (p < 0.001). The generally linear SIFc-GPP relationships were substantially affected by spatial and temporal scales and SIFc datasets. The GPP/SIFc slope of the evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) biome was significantly higher than the slopes of several other biomes (p < 0.05), while the other 11 biomes showed no significant differences in the GPP/SIFc slope between each other (p > 0.05). Therefore, we propose a two-slope scheme to differentiate ENF from non-ENF biome and synopsize spatiotemporal variability of the GPP/SIFc slope. The relative biases were 7.14% and 11.06% in the estimated cumulative GPP across all EC towers, respectively, for GOSIF and CSIF using a two-slope scheme. The significantly higher GPP/SIFc slopes of the ENF biome in the two-slope scheme are intriguing and deserve further study. In addition, there was still considerable dispersion in the comparisons of CSIF/GOSIF and GPP at both site and biome levels, calling for discriminatory analysis backed by higher spatial resolution to systematically address issues related to landscape heterogeneity and mismatch between SIFc pixel and the footprints of flux towers and their impacts on the SIF-GPP relationship.

TI  - Multi-Scale Coal Fire Detection Based on an Improved Active Contour Model from Landsat-8 Satellite and UAV Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal fires can increase surface temperature, cause surface cracks and collapse, and release poisonous and harmful gases, which significantly harm the ecological environment and humans. Traditional methods of extracting coal fires, such as global threshold, K-mean and active contour model, usually produce many false alarms. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved active contour model by introducing the distinguishing energies of coal fires and others into the traditional active contour model. Taking Urumqi, Xinjiang, China as the research area, coal fires are detected from Landsat-8 satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. The results show that the proposed method can eliminate many false alarms compared with some traditional methods, and achieve detection of small-area coal fires by referring field survey data. More importantly, the results obtained from UAV data can help identify not only burning coal fires but also potential underground coal fires. This paper provides an efficient method for high-precision coal fire detection and strong technical support for reducing environmental pollution and coal energy use.

TI  - The spatio-temporal feature of Greenland Mass Changes as determined by GRACE, Swarm, and GRACE-FO
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful implementation of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity mission has greatly advanced research in the polar ice mass balance, global water cycle, and ocean mass change. However, there was a gap between the retirement of GRACE, which ended in October 2017, and the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On mission, which began in May 2018. The Swarm mission consists of three satellites carrying GPS receivers, star cameras, and laser retro-reflectors,so they can be used to determine the Earth's gravity field. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of Swarm satellite data for inversion ice mass changes in Greenland, construct a time series from April 2002 to May 2020, and explore the causes of Greenland ice loss from temperature and precipitation data. Results showed 1) during the period from December 2013 and June 2017, the correlation coefficient between the time series of ice mass variation from Swarm and GRACE data was 0.652. 2) From June 2018 to June 2019, the correlation of Greenland ice sheet mass change was 0.518 in between GRACE-FO data and Swarm. 3) Ice mass loss in Greenland between April 2002 and May 2020 was 11.174 +/- 0.109 cm.a(-1) from GRACE, Swarm and GRACE-FO data, and the non-seasonal changes in ice sheet mass indicated that a minimum value in April 2013. 4) From August 2010 to June 2017, the temperature and runoff anomalies increased in the Greenland area, and precipitation anomalies declined in number, which caused the ice sheet in Greenland to melt. This study concluded that the Swarm satellite can be used to study the earth time-variable gravity field and bridge the gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO mission.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study was carried out in the 2021 year with the objective of estimating yield of sugarcane through the Normalized Difference Index of Vegetation in the "Cristino Naranjo" Sugar Company, located in the Cacocum municipality, Holguin province, Cuba. 32 randomized sample points were drawn in different months in which the images belonging to the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite projected in the WGS 84 UTM Zone 18 North system in grid 011/046 were chosen. The radiometric correction of each satellite image and the sampling scheme were carried out with the QGIS "A Coruna" software version 3.10. The value of each point was extracted with ArcGIS 10.5 after the calculation of the NDVI. For the statistical processing, Stargraphics Plus 5.0 software was used; in which, the linear regression analysis was carried out between the values obtained from the NDVI at each sampling point and the real yield values offered by specialists from the central analysis area that corresponds to the image data used. The determination of the NDVI vegetative index showed values from 0 to 0.5, equivalent to a low vegetation in the study area. The coefficient of determination indicates that the model explains 97.85 of the yield variability in the sugarcane crop, which can be used as a mathematical model for estimating crop yield under the edaphoclimatic conditions of the study site.

TI  - The idealization of rural spaces in secondary and high school education. A study of social representations
T2  - REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE SOCIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The theory of social representations contributes to know the discourses that influence people's lives and how subjects reproduce that knowledge to interpret the world. The knowledge that interests us in this research is the worldview that 3rd year of Compulsory Secundary Education and 2nd year Baccalaureate students from the province of Valencia (Spain) have about rural areas. Their worldview comes from different sources and information contexts, so the application of social representations to the field of geography didactics is pertinent in this study. Specifically, the phenomenological approach of the Geography of Perception and Behavior joins the social representations of geographic space in its subjective and tripartite aspect (lived space, perceived space, and conceived space). This is how it is intended to understand the elements that influence the school explanation of rural spaces and their presence in the school geography to achieve two objectives: first, to know the structure and meaning of the school representation of students from ten schools in the province of Valencia; second, to check how the representation of the human figure has been captured in textbooks at those same educational levels between 1959 and 2016 and in the pictorial representations of students to show convergent trends in the elements of a social representation of these spaces. For this, 581 students from schools in the province of Valencia (Spain) answered a mixed questionnaire, with a word association test analyzed using the Evocation 2005 software. The application of the chi-square index to the analysis of the photographs of the textbooks and the drawings of the students about rural spaces reveals that there is an idealized representation of these spaces, making difficult to understand social and environmental problems.

TI  - Short communication: investigation of the feasibility of genomic selection in Icelandic Cattle
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Icelandic Cattle is a local dairy cattle breed in Iceland. With about 26,000 breeding females, it is by far the largest among the indigenous Nordic cattle breeds. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of genomic selection in Icelandic Cattle. Pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) and single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) were compared. Accuracy, bias, and dispersion of estimated breeding values (EBV) for milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), and somatic cell score (SCS) were estimated in a cross validation-based design. Accuracy ((r) over cap) was estimated by the correlation between EBV and corrected phenotype in a validation set. The accuracy ((r) over cap) of predictions using ssGBLUP increased by 13, 23, 19, and 20 percentage points for MY, FY, PY, and SCS for genotyped animals, compared with PBLUP. The accuracy of nongenotyped animals was not improved for MY and PY, but increased by 0.9 and 3.5 percentage points for FY and SCS. We used the linear regression (LR) method to quantify relative improvements in accuracy, bias ((Delta) over cap), and dispersion ((b) over cap) of EBV. Using the LR method, the relative improvements in accuracy of validation from PBLUP to ssGBLUP were 43%, 60%, 50%, and 48% for genotyped animals for MY, FY, PY, and SCS. Single-step GBLUP EBV were less underestimated ((Delta) over cap), and less overdispersed ((Delta) over cap) than PBLUP EBV for FY and PY. Pedigree-based BLUP EBV were close to unbiased for MY and SCS. Single-step GBLUP underestimated MY EBV but overestimated SCS EBV. Based on the average accuracy of 0.45 for ssGBLUP EBV obtained in this study, selection intensities according to the breeding scheme of Icelandic Cattle, and assuming a generation interval of 2.0 yr for sires of bulls, sires of dams and dams of bulls, genetic gain in Icelandic Cattle could be increased by about 50% relative to the current breeding scheme.

TI  - Improved Accuracy of Phenological Detection in Rice Breeding by Using Ensemble Models of Machine Learning Based on UAV-RGB Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely detection of phenology at plot scale in rice breeding trails is crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of varieties and guiding field management. Traditionally, remote sensing studies of phenology detection have heavily relied on the time-series vegetation index (VI) data. However, the methodology based on time-series VI data was often limited by the temporal resolution. In this study, three types of ensemble models including hard voting (majority voting), soft voting (weighted majority voting) and model stacking, were proposed to identify the principal phenological stages of rice based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery. These ensemble models combined RGB-VIs, color space (e.g., RGB and HSV) and textures derived from UAV-RGB imagery, and five machine learning algorithms (random forest; k-nearest neighbors; Gaussian naive Bayes; support vector machine and logistic regression) as base models to estimate phenological stages in rice breeding. The phenological estimation models were trained on the dataset of late-maturity cultivars and tested independently on the dataset of early-medium-maturity cultivars. The results indicated that all ensemble models outperform individual machine learning models in all datasets. The soft voting strategy provided the best performance for identifying phenology with the overall accuracy of 90% and 93%, and the mean F1-scores of 0.79 and 0.81, respectively, in calibration and validation datasets, which meant that the overall accuracy and mean F1-scores improved by 5% and 7%, respectively, in comparison with those of the best individual model (GNB), tested in this study. Therefore, the ensemble models demonstrated great potential in improving the accuracy of phenology detection in rice breeding.

TI  - Mangrove Ecosystem Mapping Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Random Forest Algorithm in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are among the most productive ecosystems in existence, with many ecological benefits. Therefore, generating accurate thematic maps from mangrove ecosystems is crucial for protecting, conserving, and reforestation planning for these valuable natural resources. In this paper, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images were used in synergy to produce a detailed mangrove ecosystem map of the Hara protected area, Qeshm, Iran, at 10 m spatial resolution within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. In this regard, 86 Sentinel-1 and 41 Sentinel-2 data, acquired in 2019, were employed to generate seasonal optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features. Afterward, seasonal features were inserted into a pixel-based random forest (RF) classifier, resulting in an accurate mangrove ecosystem map with average overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) of 93.23% and 0.92, respectively, wherein all classes (except aerial roots) achieved high producer and user accuracies of over 90%. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed to investigate the robustness of the proposed approach, and the accurate and stable results achieved through cross-validation and consistency checks confirmed its robustness and applicability. It was revealed that seasonal features and the integration of multi-source remote sensing data contributed towards obtaining a more reliable mangrove ecosystem map. The proposed approach relies on a straightforward yet effective workflow for mangrove ecosystem mapping, with a high rate of automation that can be easily implemented for frequent and precise mapping in other parts of the world. Overall, the proposed workflow can further improve the conservation and sustainable management of these valuable natural resources.

The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr, Mn, Fe, Hg, Mo, and Cd in 23 soil samples and 25 samples from granitic and Cenozoic marine sedimentary formations. The geochemical results have been integrated with remote sensing, GIS, and statistical analysis to assess the severity of soil pollution in the area. The concentrations of heavy metals (ppm) in the collected soil samples were as follows: Fe (2259.70), Mn (101.85), Zn (20.15), Pb (10.74), Cr ( 8.67), Cu (6.10), Co (1.35), Mo (0.69), Hg (0.30), and Cd (0.17). A significant variation in the mean metal concentrations was observed for the rock samples. The correlation analysis results showed that different degrees of positive and negative relationships exist among different metals in the area. Two factors (PC1 and PC2) were identified using the principal component analysis PCA) and were responsible for about 60% of the total variance in the data. The studied metals were separated and classified into two factors based on their geochemical features and source. In contrast, the hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the identified metals into different groups based on the similarity of their characteristics. The principal component (PC2) applied to the Sentinel-2A image classified the land cover in the area into three classes: vegetation, barren rocks, and urban area. The enrichment factor shows a relatively higher percentage of enriched Mo; however, the indices of geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk generally reveal no substantial metallic contamination in the study area. The main sources of soil contamination with metals are rock-weathering processes and various agricultural works that are widely practiced in the area.

TI  - Results of the Dragon 4 Project on New Ocean Remote Sensing Data for Operational Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the Dragon 4 project dealing with operational monitoring of sea ice and sea surface salinity (SSS) and new product developments for altimetry data. To improve sea ice thickness retrieval, a new method was developed to match the Cryosat-2 radar waveform. Additionally, an automated sea ice drift detection scheme was developed and tested on Sentinel-1 data, and the sea ice drifty capability of Gaofen-4 geostationary optical data was evaluated. A second topic included implementation and validation of a prototype of a Fully-Focussed SAR processor adapted for Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 altimeters and evaluation of its performance with Sentinel-3 data over the Yellow Sea; the assessment of sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH), and wind speed measurements using different altimeters and CFOSAT SWIM; and the fusion of SSH measurements in mapping sea level anomaly (SLA) data to detect mesoscale eddies. Thirdly, the investigations on the retrieval of SSS include simulations to analyse the performances of the Chinese payload configurations of the Interferometric Microwave Radiometer and the Microwave Imager Combined Active and Passive, SSS retrieval under rain conditions, and the combination of active and passive microwave to study extreme winds.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Complex Systems: Taming the Complexity of Expert Models to Improve Decision Making
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.

TI  - Estimation of Hail Damage Using Crop Models and Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Insurance agents often provide crop hail damage estimates based on their personal experience and field samples, which are not always representative of the investigated field's spatial variability. For these reasons, farmers and the insurance market ask for a reliable, objective, and less labor-intensive method to determine crop hail losses. Integrating remote sensing and crop modeling provides a unique opportunity for the crop insurance market for a reliable, objective, and less labor-intensive method to estimate hail damage. To this end, a study was conducted on eight distinct maize fields for a total of 90 hectares. Five fields were damaged by the hailstorm that occurred on 13 July 2019 and three were not damaged. Soil and plant samples were collected to characterize the experimental areas. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was deployed to determine the total aboveground biomass and obtainable yield at harvest, using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images. Modeled hail damages (HDDSSAT1, coupling SEBAL estimates of obtainable yield and DSSAT-based potential yield; HDDSSAT2, coupling yield map at harvest and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)-based potential yield) were calculated and compared to the estimates of the insurance company (HDinsurance). SEBAL-based biomass and yield estimates agreed with in-season measurements (-4% and +0.5%, respectively). While some under and overestimations were observed, HDinsurance and HDDSSAT1 averaged similar values (-4.9% and +3.4%) compared to the reference approach (HDDSSAT2).

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to compare the glacial lake variation in 1988-2018 period by ice-free land sector in King George Island (KGI) and Nelson Island (NI). Lake sectors were grouped by multivariate statistics techniques. Areal lake and glacier evolution are estimated by Landsat and Sentinel images segmentation and NDWI (was obtained 68-77% of the accuracy) and using others spaceborne remote sensing data. Wanda, Vieville, Znosco e Anna Sul ice-marginal lakes have increased by 636%, 214%, 173% and 110%, respectively. The lower variation (83%, 71%, 68%, 43% and 20%) were showed in lakes of the ice-free land areas exposed by shrinkage in Baranowski Glacier, Polar Club Glacier, NI ice cap, Fourcade Glacier and in Fildes Peninsula, respectively. Were detected the formation of 37 new glacial lakes in the 1988-2018 period. The climate warming, meltwater retention due glacier discharge and coalescence of small and shallow lakes too play important roles in ice-marginal lakes evolution at decadal-scale variations.

TI  - Severe occupational accidents reported at a sentinel unit from 2008 to 2018.
T2  - Revista brasileira de medicina do trabalho : publicacao oficial da Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho-ANAMT
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Occupational accidents are a major public health problem. In addition to damages to workers' health, they are also associated with economic and social losses. Since 2004, this type of accident has become of mandatory reporting through the Notifiable Diseases Information System. However, underreporting still reaches high levels.Objectives: To identify and describe data on severe occupational accidents reported at an Occupational Health Unit.Methods: This is a retrospective observational study based on data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System. Occupational accidents that occurred from 2008 to 2018 in the state of Parana, Brazil, and reported by the Occupational Health Unit, located in Hospital do Trabalhador in Curitiba.Results: Overall, 7,396 occupational accidents were reported, and most workers evolved with temporary disability (86%). The most frequently affected occupations were related to the area of construction industry (3.4%); however, it is worth highlighting the significant absence of this information in the reports (16.4%). Upper limbs were the most affected body region (42.5%).Conclusions: The report of occupational accidents has significantly improved in the last years, but underreporting remains a significant issue and there is a gap in data about the accident circumstances. Therefore, this study aimed to generate data to assist in the development of policies for the promotion and care of workers' health, in addition to being used for comparison in future statistics.

TI  - Airborne laser scanning for quantifying criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management in Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has emerged as a technology capable of generating descriptors of vegetation structure and best available terrain information. Research and operational implementations of ALS data have highlighted their value for characterizing forest structure and generating spatially explicit and objective spatial coverages and mapping products for forest management. Continued emphasis to enhance forest stewardship is promoting novel methods to integrate ALS to detail non-timber ecosystem values like habitat, soil, and water. Standardized criteria and indicator frameworks such as the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers provide a reliable starting point for where ALS has opportunities to characterize ecosystems objectively regardless of location. In this review of primarily Canadian work, we highlight how ALS is becoming an increasingly viable technology for deriving meaningful indicators to meet sustainable forest management criteria. We review and highlight the value of ALS for quantifying indicators of biological diversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil and water, and the role of forests in global ecological cycles. We conclude by highlighting the need for increased education, tech transfer, flexible software, and reporting frameworks alongside five key considerations for using ALS to derive meaningful indicators of sustainable forest management.

TI  - Environmental Controls on the Temporal Evolution of Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> Fluxes on an Arid Mangrove of Northwestern Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explored the environmental factors that control the temporal dynamics of vertical energy and carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and arid mangroves located on the coastline of the Gulf of California, Mexico. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent (lambda E) and sensible heat (H) exchange fluxes were estimated in situ using the eddy covariance technique along with meteorological and hydrological observations during the period November 2017 through November 2019. Moreover, multiyear mangrove phenology at footprint-scale was tracked using remotely sensed vegetation greenness data from Sentinel-2. Our results suggest that the seasonal energy partition and the magnitude of NEE is highly coupled with seasonal changes in the level of tidal flooding, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature. Low tidal levels facilitate heat transmission to the atmosphere leading the energy partition to H, while the increase in flooding and VPD facilitates the transmission of water vapor resulting in lambda E dominance. The lowest rate of NEE was observed during the months of highest tidal flooding (June-August) while the highest seasonal rate of NEE matched with the lowest mean flood levels (March-May). Estimated annual NEE for 2018 was -745.3 gC m(-2) y(-1) while for 2019 was -307.4 gC m(-2) y(-1). Our findings suggest a possible trend of decrease in the capacity of carbon sequestration of arid mangroves with rising sea levels and air temperature as a result of global warming.

TI  - Self-reported Subjective Effects of Analytically Confirmed New Psychoactive Substances Consumed by e-Psychonauts: Protocol for a Longitudinal Study Using a New Internet-Based Methodology
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During the last few years, the continuous emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) has become an important public health challenge. The use of NPS has been rising in two different ways: buying and consuming NPS knowingly and the presence of NPS in traditional drugs as adulterants. The rise of NPS use is increasing the number of different substances in the market to an extent impossible to study with current scientific methodologies. This has caused a remarkable absence of necessary information about newer drug effects on people who use drugs, mental health professionals, and policy makers. Current scientific methodologies have failed to provide enough data in the timeframe when critical decisions must be made, being not only too slow but also too square. Last but not least, they dramatically lack the high resolution of phenomenological details.Objective: This study aims to characterize a population of e-psychonauts and the subjective effects of the NPS they used during the study period using a new, internet-based, fast, and inexpensive methodology. This will allow bridging an evidence gap between online surveys, which do not provide substance confirmation, and clinical trials, which are too slow and expensive to keep up with the new substances appearing every week.Methods: To cover this purpose, we designed a highly personalized, observational longitudinal study methodology. Participants will be recruited from online communities of people who use NPS, and they will be followed online by means of a continuous objective and qualitative evaluation lasting for at least 1 year. In addition, participants will send samples of the substances they intend to use during that period, so they can be analyzed and matched with the effects they report on the questionnaires.Results: The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital del Mar Research Institute on December 11, 2018. Data collection started in August 2019 and was still ongoing when the protocol was submitted (September 2020). The first data collection period of the study ended in October 2020. Data analysis began in November 2020, and it is still ongoing. The authors expect to submit the first results for publication by the end of 2021. A preliminary analysis was conducted when the manuscript was submitted and was reviewed after it was accepted in February 2021.Conclusions: It is possible to conduct an institutional review board-approved study using this new methodology and collect the expected data. However, the meaning and usefulness of these data are still unknown.

TI  - Sentinel lymph Node mapping versus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy on the prognosis for patients with intermediate-high-risk Endometrial Cancer confined to the uterus before surgery: trial protocol for a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (SNEC trial)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has been recommended as an alternative staging approach to lymphadenectomy for apparent uterine-confined endometrial cancer (EC). However, the prognostic value of SLN mapping alone instead of systematic lymphadenectomy on EC patients remains unclear.Methods: A multi-center, open label, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial has been designed to identify if SLN mapping alone is not inferior to pelvic lymphadenectomy on prognosis of patients with intermediate-high-risk EC clinically confined to uterus. Eligible patients will be 1:1 randomly assigned to accept SLN mapping or pelvic lymphadenectomy. The primary endpoint is the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). The second points are the 5-year PFS, 5-year overall survival, surgery-related adverse events and life quality. A total of 780 patients will be enrolled from 6 hospitals in China within 3-year period and followed up for 5 years.

TI  - Statistical Scattering Component-Based Subspace Alignment for Unsupervised Cross-Domain PolSAR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing amounts of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images from different sensors covering different scenes are available, but limited labeled samples and trained models can hardly work well in these cross-domain data interpretations. Fortunately, domain adaptation (DA) can transfer knowledge in existing images to new yet related images. DA shows attractive potential for PolSAR classification, and it is still challenging due to more complex domain shifts caused by different sensors, imaging conditions, and distributions. Inspired by the widely applicable polarimetric scattering mechanisms and DA ability of subspace alignment (SA), this article is devoted to constructing a robust unsupervised cross-domain PolSAR classification framework, by exploring scattering and statistical characteristics mapping between the source and target domains. First, classical scattering components of both source and target data were extracted, and Wishart clustering was adopted to derive the statistical information of scattering components at patch level. Second, the intrinsic polarimetric scattering components were estimated and extracted, which were called statistical scattering components (SSCs). Third, by applying SA, the source SSC was aligned with target SSC, and domain shift was further reduced. Finally, the target PolSAR image was classified based on labeled samples from source domain, and unsupervised cross-domain classification was achieved by SSC-based SA (SSC-SA). The unsupervised cross-domain experiments are conducted on 49 units among 11 data sets, including Radarsat-2, Gaofen-3, AIRSAR, and Pi-SAR images. With randomly selected labeled samples (about 2x0025;10x0025;) from source domain, the accuracies of the proposed cross-domain classifications range between 80.20x0025; and 95.64x0025;. Also, the proposed SSC feature pattern is proved extensible for other polarimetric basis and decompositions.

TI  - Internet-of-Things-Based Geotechnical Monitoring Boosted by Satellite InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides, often a side effect of mining activities, pose a significant risk to humans and infrastructures such as urban areas, power lines, and dams. Operational ground motion monitoring can help detect the spatial pattern of surface changes and their evolution over time. In this technical note, a commercial, cost-effective method combining a network of geotechnical surface sensors with the InSAR data was reported for the first time to accurately monitor surface displacement. The correlation of both data sets is demonstrated in the Gediminas Castle testbed, where slope failure events were detected. Two specific events were analyzed, and possible causes proposed. The combination of techniques allows one to detect the precursors of the events and characterize the consequences of the failures in different areas in proximity to the castle walls, since the solution allows for the confirmation of long-term drifts and sudden movements in real time. The data from the in situ sensors were also used to refine the satellite data analysis. The results demonstrate that not all events pose a direct threat to the safety of the structure monitored.

TI  - The effect of preoperative 18f Fdg-Pet on staging and treatment protocols in breast cancer patients
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: We aimed to evaluate the effect of PET taken before surgery on the treatment protocol in patients diagnosed with BC and whether PET resulted in changes in the disease stage.MATERIAL AND METHODS: BC patients in our hospital who underwent surgery between 2016-2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The effect of preoperative PET on the treatment protocol was evaluated in all. Patients were divided into subgroups depending on whether they underwent direct surgery without CTX or were operated on after CTX initiation. In addition, in the group that did not receive CTX, axillary findings of PET were compared with postoperative histopathological results, and axillary PPV, NPV, sensitivity and specificity of PET were determined. In this subgroup, the preoperative PET stage was compared with the postoperative histopathological stage, and any changes in the disease stage were compared.RESULTS: In our study, PET affected the treatment protocol of 19 patients (20%). PET resulted in staging differences in 57.6% overall, increased staging in four patients (8.8%) who did not receive early-stage CT, and lower staging in 22 (48.8%) patients in the group. In early-stage BC of PET, the PPV for axilla was 81.2%, the NPV was 65.5%, sensitivity was 56.5%, and specificity was 86.3%.DISCUSSION: Although PET has many limitations, the determination of the size of the primary tumor and the multiple foci at different locations according to PET findings helped us to easily determine the treatment protocol for patients planned for BCS.CONCLUSION: The preoperative routine use of PET, which can provide more information about metastasis and stage than other methods in patients undergoing BC surgery, may improve the management of treatment in these patients.

TI  - The long-term trend of Bohai Sea ice in different emission scenarios
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a coupled ocean-sea ice model, this study investigates how changes in the mean state of the atmosphere in different CO2 emission scenarios (RCP 8.5, 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6) may affect the sea ice in the Bohai Sea, China, especially in the Liaodong Bay, the largest bay in the Bohai Sea. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, an abrupt change of the atmospheric state happens around 2070. Due to the abrupt change, wintertime sea ice of the Liaodong Bay can be divided into 3 periods: a mild decreasing period (2021-2060), in which the sea ice severity weakens at a near-constant rate; a rapid decreasing period (2061-2080), in which the sea ice severity drops dramatically; and a stabilized period (2081-2100). During 2021-2060, the dates of first ice are approximately unchanged, suggesting that the onset of sea ice is probably determined by a cold-air event and is not sensitive to the mean state of the atmosphere. The mean and maximum sea ice thickness in the Liaodong Bay is relatively stable before 2060, and then drops rapidly in the following decade. Different from the RCP 8.5 scenario, atmospheric state changes smoothly in the RCP 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6 scenarios. In the RCP 6.0 scenario, the sea ice severity in the Bohai Sea weakens with time to the end of the twenty-first century. In the RCP 4.5 scenario, the sea ice severity weakens with time until reaching a stable state around the 2070s. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, the sea ice severity weakens until the 2040s, stabilizes from then, and starts intensifying after the 2080s. The sea ice condition in the other bays of the Bohai Sea is also discussed under the four CO2 emissions scenarios. Among atmospheric factors, air temperature is the leading one for the decline of the sea ice extent. Specific humidity also plays an important role in the four scenarios. The surface downward shortwave/longwave radiation and meridional wind only matter in certain scenarios, while effects from the zonal wind and precipitation are negligible.

TI  - DO RATING CHANGES SIGNAL ABNORMAL RETURNS IN STOCK? EVIDENCE FROM INDIA
T2  - JIMS8M-THE JOURNAL OF INDIAN MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study attempts to assess if rating changes: both downgrades and upgrades impact the stock prices and lead to abnormal stock returns.Design/methodology/approach: For this, we identified 60 firms which had undergone rating changes (both upgrades and downgrades) for three instruments: bank loans, non-government debt and letter of credit between FY 17-FY20. We applied event study methodology for further analysis.Findings: In the first step of analysis we observed that the upgrades of ratings did lead to positive returns on stock prices while rating downgrades, (contrary to the pressure price hypothesis) show no impact on the stock prices. For specific instruments we observed that while for bank loans, there is no statistically significant impact of ratings upgrade of on stock prices; there is a positive impact of ratings upgrade of non-government debt and letter of credit on stock prices. For rating downgrades, there is no impact of ratings downgrade of term Loans and non-government debt on stock prices; while for LCs, the impact is positive. We conclude that Indian markets do not show strong form of efficiency as there is a positive impact of ratings upgrade on stock prices.Originality/value: This is the first study that analyses for rating changes impact for three instruments which include fund-based dull non-fund based, and not related to public debt for which external ratings are mandated. Our findings are also contrary to prior works that stated that rating downgrades convey additional information. Our as there is no impact on stock prices while for specific instruments, rating upgrades do lead to abnormal returns. We conclude that ratings do not always communicate in additional information to the capital markets and greater disclosure of information by them will instil confidence in investors and pave the way for development of capital markets.

TI  - Ethnic Identity and Well-Being of Andean Indigenous People: The Effect of Individualistic and Collectivist Value Orientations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the mediating effect of the value orientations of collectivism and individualism on the relationship between ethnic identity and well-being, the latter conceived from the worldview of Andean natives. For this purpose, under an observational and cross-sectional design, 395 Lickan-Antay adults (57% women) living in areas of indigenous development and in two cities in northern Chile were surveyed. We used the Lickan-Antay BLA32 well-being scale, a short version of the Portrait 21 Values Questionnaire to measure individualistic and collectivistic values, and an adapted version of the Ethnic Identity Scale. The results show that ethnic identity had a direct positive effect on all three dimensions of well-being (harmony with community life, ethnic harmony and harmony with nature), and total indirect effects on all five dimensions of well-being, one of them originating mainly from collectivist orientations. Individualistic orientations also showed a positive, though less intense, mediating effect on well-being. We conclude that collectivist and individualistic motivational patterns coexist in Lickan-Antay natives and explain an important part of the relationship between ethnic identity and well-being. Finally, we discuss our results and suggest replication of this study in other ethnic contexts to assess the generalizability of these findings to other native peoples of the Andean region of South America.

TI  - Evaluation of the change in synthetic aperture radar imaging using transfer learning and residual network
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection from synthetic aperture radar images becomes a key technique to detect change area related to some phenomenon as flood and deformation of the earth surface. This paper proposes a transfer learning and Residual Network with 18 layers (ResNet-18) architecture-based method for change detection from two synthetic aperture radar images. Before the application of the proposed technique, batch denoising using convolutional neural network is applied to the two input synthetic aperture radar image for speckle noise reduction. To validate the performance of the proposed method, three known synthetic aperture radar datasets (Ottawa; Mexican and for Taiwan Shimen datasets) are exploited in this paper. The use of these datasets is important because the ground truth is known, and this can be considered as the use of numerical simulation. The detected change image obtained by the proposed method is compared using two image metrics. The first metric is image quality index that measures the similarity ratio between the obtained image and the image of the ground truth, the second metrics is edge preservation index, it measures the performance of the method to preserve edges. Finally, the method is applied to determine the changed area using two Sentinel 1 B synthetic aperture radar images of Eddahbi dam situated in Morocco.

TI  - A Secure Architecture of Relay-Aided Space Information Networks
T2  - IEEE NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been extensively investigated as an enabling technology to support massive devices or sensors. With increasing demands of seamless connectivity of IoT, space information networks (SINs) are adopted to provide reliable communications for IoT devices at any time and anywhere. However, the conventional SIN suffers from different malicious attacks (e.g., jamming attack, eavesdropping attack) due to its highly exposed satellite-ground links with fixed spot beams. Those attacks may cause severe security problems to SINs. To overcome these drawbacks, in this article, a secure architecture is proposed as a promising strategy to improve the security of SINs, where relays are deployed together with hopped beams to relieve the jamming attack of the uplink and combat the eavesdropping attack of the downlink. In the proposed new structure, by utilizing spatial diversity, inter-satellite beam hopping is developed to build jamming-free uplink channels, while relay selection is carried out to form eavesdropping-free downlink channels. Meanwhile, relay deployment optimization is studied to maximize the system efficiency, and data aggregation is adopted to encrypt the data packets of IoT devices at relays. As a result, the security of SINs can be strongly improved in the existence of jamming and eavesdropping threats. Furthermore, future works for the secure SIN are also discussed.

TI  - Construction and Application of a Knowledge Graph
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development and improvement of modern surveying and remote-sensing technology, data in the fields of surveying and remote sensing have grown rapidly. Due to the characteristics of large-scale, heterogeneous and diverse surveys and the loose organization of surveying and remote-sensing data, effectively obtaining information and knowledge from data can be difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of using ontology for heterogeneous data integration. Based on the heterogeneous, decentralized, and dynamic updates of large surveying and remote-sensing data, this paper constructs a knowledge graph for surveying and remote-sensing applications. First, data are extracted. Second, using the ontology editing tool Protege, a knowledge graph mode level is constructed. Then, using a relational database, data are stored, and a D2RQ tool maps the data from the mode level's ontology to the data layer. Then, using the D2RQ tool, a SPARQL protocol and resource description framework query language (SPARQL) endpoint service is used to describe functions such as query and reasoning of the knowledge graph. The graph database is then used to display the knowledge graph. Finally, the knowledge graph is used to describe the correlation between the fields of surveying and remote sensing.

TI  - Living Death: Imagined History and the Tarrant Manifesto
T2  - EMOTIONS-HISTORY CULTURE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay analyses the manifesto of terrorist Brenton Tarrant, the perpetrator of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. Reading Tarrant's manifesto (The Great Replacement) as a cultural artefact of digital white nationalism, it is possible to identify a specific worldview and emotional subjectivity that is also shared with the actions and writing of Anders Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Oslo and Utoya massacre. After examining both terrorists' manifestos, their biographical particulars and drawing from ethnographic research into the online communities that Tarrant frequented, a shared phenomenological framework emerges. This framework is presented as 'the imagined past and present' of the Replacement Theory terrorist. This essay will address these white nationalist imaginings via a cultural exegesis of Tarrant's and Breivik's manifestos, as well as an analysis of their comparable monastic aesthetic or 'living death' in the lead up to their attacks.

TI  - Combining Multiple Geospatial Data for Estimating Aboveground Biomass in North Carolina Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and quantifying forest inventories are critical for the management and development of forests for natural resource conservation and for the evaluation of the aboveground forest biomass (AGFB) technically available for bioenergy production. The AGFB estimation procedures that rely on traditional, spatially sparse field inventory samples constitute a problem for geographically diverse regions such as the state of North Carolina in the southeastern U.S. We propose an alternative AGFB estimation procedure that combines multiple geospatial data. The procedure uses land cover maps to allocate forested land areas to alternative forest types; uses the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to evaluate tree heights; calculates the area-total AGFB using region- and tree-type-specific functions that relate the tree heights to the AGFB. We demonstrate the procedure for a selected North Carolina region, a 2.3 km(2) area randomly chosen in Duplin County. The tree diameter functions are statistically estimated based on the Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data, and two publicly available, open source land cover maps, Crop Data Layer (CDL) and National Land Cover Database (NLCD), are compared and contrasted as a source of information on the location and typology of forests in the study area. The assessment of the consistency of forestland mapping derived from the CDL and the NLCD data lets us estimate how the disagreement between the two alternative, widely used maps affects the AGFB estimation. The methodology and the results we present are expected to complement and inform large-scale assessments of woody biomass in the region.

TI  - Monitoring the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on the Production of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Pollutants Using Satellite Imagery: A Case Study of South Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the numerous anthropogenic pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the leading contaminants mainly released by burning fossil fuels in industrial and transport sectors. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the growing trend of NO2 emissions in South Asia. Satellite imagery data of Sentinel-5 Precursor with Tropomi instrument was employed in this study. The analysis was performed using time series data from February-May 2019 and February-May 2020. The time frame from February-May 2020 was further divided into two sub-time-frames, i.e., from 1 February-20 March (pre-lockdown) and from 21 March-May 2020 (lockdown). Results show the concentration of NO2 pollutants over the region declined by 6.41% from February-May 2019 to February-May 2020. Interestingly, an increasing trend of NO2 concentration by 6.58% occurred during the pre-lockdown phase in 2020 (1 February-20 March) compared to 2019 (February-May). However, the concentration of NO2 pollutants reduced considerably by 21.10% during the lockdown phase (21 March-10 May) compared to the pre-lockdown phase in 2020. Furthermore, the country-specific detailed analysis demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19-attributed lockdown on NO2 concentration in South Asia.

TI  - Remote Sensing Images Mosaicking Method Based on Spatiotemporal Fusion
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limited width of high-resolution satellites, earth observation applications involving a large area usually require mosaics of multiple high-resolution images taken at different times or different sensors. The process of mosaicing images usually includes 5 basic steps: sorting, registration, color balance, seam line detection, and overlap area fusion. The existing color balance methods do not make full use of the existing satellite data, and most of the algorithms only pursue visual effects, not the fidelity of the data. For this reason, a new spatio temporal fusion mosaic framework is proposed. The framework introduces the spatio temporal fusion method based on the enhanced deep super-resolution network, and the images of all shooting moments are adjusted to the same time through a global reference image to ensure consistent color styles. The method in this paper carries out mosaic testing in the red, green, and blue bands of LandSat8 images. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than the existing mosaic methods.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The shallow neural network (SNN) is a popular algorithm in atmospheric parameters retrieval from microwave remote sensing. However, the deep neural network (DNN) has a stronger nonlinear mapping capability compared to SNN and has great potential for applications in microwave remote sensing. The Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (Beijing, China, MWHTS) onboard the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellite has the ability to independently retrieve atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. A study on the application of DNN in retrieving atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles from MWHTS was carried out. Three retrieval schemes of atmospheric parameters in microwave remote sensing based on DNN were performed in the study of bias correction of MWHTS observation and the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles using MWHTS observations. The experimental results show that, compared with SNN, DNN can obtain better bias-correction results when applied to MWHTS observation, and can obtain higher retrieval accuracy of temperature and humidity profiles in all three retrieval schemes. Meanwhile, DNN shows higher stability than SNN when applied to the retrieval of temperature and humidity profiles. The comparative study of DNN and SNN applied in different atmospheric parameter retrieval schemes shows that DNN has a more superior performance.

TI  - Bilinear Squeeze-and-Excitation Network for Fine-Grained Classification of Tree Species
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species classification is beneficial to multiple applications but is difficult because the categories should be discriminated by subtle differences, and the acquisition of class labels is both expensive and time-consuming. In this letter, a bilinear squeeze-and-excitation network (BiSENet) is proposed for fine-grained classification of tree species. First, objects of the remote sensing data are constructed based on superpixel segmentation. Second, a deep neural network (i.e., BiSENet) is constructed and trained to distinguish different tree species. The proposed BiSENet is inspired by the fine-grained image classification, which is more subtle than traditional classification since it classifies the images within a subordinate category. Moreover, the AdaBound optimization method is adopted to obtain the optimal parameters of BiSENet. Experiments on the Haizhu Lake data acquired by the Jilin-1 satellite demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior quantitative and qualitative performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Determination of land surface temperature using Landsat 8 images: Comparative study of algorithms on the city of Granada
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite images has become, in recent decades, one of the most common ways to determine the Land Surface Temperature (LST). One of them is through the use of Landsat 8 images that requires the use of single-channel (MC) and two-channel (BC) algorithms. In this study, the LST of a medium-sized city, Granada (Spain) has been determined over a year by using five Landsat 8 algorithms that are subsequently compared with ambient temperatures. Few studies compare the data source with the seasonal variations of the same metropolis, which together with its geographical location, high pollution and the significant thermal variations it experiences make it a suitable place for the development of this research. As a result of the statistical analysis process, the regression coefficients R-2, mean square error (RMSE), mean error bias (MBE) and standard deviation (SD) were obtained. The average results obtained reveal that the LST derived from the BC algorithms (1.0 degrees C) are the closest to the ambient temperatures in contrast to the MC (-5.6 degrees C), although important variations have been verified between the different zones of the city according to its coverage and seasonal periods. Therefore, it is concluded that the BC algorithms are the most suitable for recovering the LST of the city under study.

TI  - EM-EOF: Gap-Filling in Incomplete SAR Displacement Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An iterative method, namely expectation maximization-empirical orthogonal functions (EM-EOF) is proposed for the first time to retrieve missing values in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) displacement time series. This method decomposes the temporal covariance of a displacement measurement time series into different EOF modes by solving the eigenvalue problem, and then selects the optimal number of EOF modes to reconstruct the time series. After an appropriate initialization of missing values, the EM-EOF method performs: 1) a cross-validation root-mean-square error (cross-RMSE) minimization to find an estimate of the optimal number of EOF modes used in the reconstruction and 2) an iterative update of missing values which gives the best estimate of missing data points according to the cross-RMSE. Synthetic simulations have been first performed to highlight the efficiency of EM-EOF in the case of various displacement signal complexities and different types of noise and gaps, and a thorough error analysis has been conducted to determine the sensitivity of the method to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), quantity of gaps, and type of noise and gaps. Then, EM-EOF is applied to three displacement measurement time series computed from Sentinel-1 A/B SAR images: two interferograms time series over Gorner and Miage glaciers, and one offset time series over the Argentix00E8;re Glacier covering a period extending from September 2016 to December 2017. Both synthetic simulations and real data applications demonstrate the ability of EM-EOF to retrieve missing values, even in the cases of frequent data gaps, limited size of the time series, and spatio-temporally correlated noise and gaps.

Previous studies have suggested that the postseismic deformation is dominated by afterslip, but the spatiotemporal evolution of the afterslip, hence its cause and impact on regional seismicity are disputed, and contribution from other postseismic processes has not been well constrained. Here, we constructed an afterslip model using InSAR and GPS observations over three years after the Gorkha earthquake. First, the Sentinel-1A satellite data were processed using Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar method to extract deformational signals at high-coherence points, and a fitting method was used to extract the postseismic displacement sequences. We then used InSAR and GPS data in a joint inversion for the evolution of afterslip, and compared its contribution to the observed postseismic displacement to that of viscoelastic relaxation and poroelastic rebound. Our results confirm that afterslip has dominated the observed postseismic deformation in the Gorkha region. Within 3 years of the Gorkha earthquake, afterslip released similar to 1.20 x 10(20) N m, about 14% of that released by the mainshock and the largest aftershock, or equivalent to an Mw 7.32 earthquake. The afterslip has occurred mostly downdip of the coseismic slip zone, in the ductile shear zone, apparently controlled by rheological properties. The updip shallow portion of the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) zone has not been ruptured by coseismic slip or unlocked by afterslip, thus could potentially produce future earthquakes.

TI  - Improving Snow Estimates Through Assimilation of MODIS Fractional Snow Cover Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms and the Common Land Model
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an innovative MODIS fractional snow cover (SCF) data assimilation (DA) prototype framework that invokes machine learning (ML) techniques and Common land model (CoLM) is proposed to improve the estimation of the snow depth (SD) and the SCF. To validate our new framework, we analyzed two snow seasons from 2013 to 2015 at 46 stations in Northern Xinjiang in China. We developed 12 SCF DA schemes that represent different DA methods (direct insertion (DI) and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)), observational data (original data and gap-filled MODIS SCF data), and observation operators (five new snow depletion curves (SDCs) defined using traditional multivariate nonlinear regression and four ML methods). While improving the frequency of the SCF observations in the DI-based DA scheme only resulted in a marginal improvement in the snow estimates, by adding new SDCs fitted by ML techniques (e.g., deep belief network), and the gap-filled MODIS SCF data to the EnKF-based DA scheme, we were able to reduce model structural uncertainties of CoLM and achieve marked improvement in the accuracy of the snow estimates (RMSE = 5.92 cm, mean bias error = -1.94 cm, and average degree of improvement = 32.18% for SD estimates and RMSE = 15. 79%, mean bias error = -1.21%, and average degree of improvement = 47.95% for SCF estimates). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of improving snow estimates by combining the ML techniques with physically based snowpack model in a SCF DA framework.

TI  - Extracellular Hsp90α Promotes Tumor Lymphangiogenesis and Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection and discovery of new therapeutic targets are urgently needed to improve the breast cancer treatment outcome. Here we conducted an official clinical trial with cross-validation to corroborate human plasma Hsp90 alpha as a novel breast cancer biomarker. Importantly, similar results were noticed in detecting early-stage breast cancer patients. Additionally, levels of plasma Hsp90 alpha in breast cancer patients were gradually elevated as their clinical stages of regional lymph nodes advanced. In orthotopic breast cancer mouse models, administrating with recombinant Hsp90 alpha protein increased both the primary tumor lymphatic vessel density and sentinel lymph node metastasis by 2 and 10 times, respectively. What is more, Hsp90 alpha neutralizing antibody treatment approximately reduced 70% of lymphatic vessel density and 90% of sentinel lymph node metastasis. In the in vitro study, we demonstrated the role of extracellular Hsp90 alpha (eHsp90 alpha) as a pro-lymphangiogenic factor, which significantly enhanced migration and tube formation abilities of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Mechanistically, eHsp90 alpha signaled to the AKT pathway through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to upregulate the expression and secretion of CXCL8 in the lymphangiogenic process. Collectively, this study proves that plasma Hsp90 alpha serves as an auxiliary diagnosis biomarker and eHsp90 alpha as a molecular mediator promoting lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer.

TI  - Implementing sequencing-based surveillance in developing countries: findings from a pilot rollout for hepatitis A in China
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The emergence of SARS-Cov2 variants has highlighted the need to implement sequencing based surveillance in developing countries for early response to mutant viruses of concern. However, limited information on how to implement sequencing-based surveillance is available, and the feasibility and performance of this new type of surveillance are still in question. Methods: To understand the challenges with the implementation and to promote sequencing-based surveillance, we reported findings from a pilot for hepatitis A (HepA) in five sentinel provinces in China as an example of sequencing-based surveillance implementation. The performance of the surveillance system was evaluated by indicators related to acceptability, data quality, simplicity, utility, and timeliness. We use a scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each aspect. Results: During the pilot, 306 cases of HepA were reported, and 49.79% of samples were available for sequencing. Eleven genomic clusters were found, of which seven clusters were potentially related to a foodborne outbreak oyster based on identical viral sequence and epidemiologic investigations. The greatest strength of the system was its simplicity (Score: 2.63). The acceptability (Score: 2.0) and utility (Score: 2.33) were modest, but data quality (Score: 1.75) and timeliness (Score: 1.75) were the main challenges. Conclusions: Overall, the system performed satisfactorily and proved to be useful for virological characterization of cases and early outbreak detection, with a great potential for scale-up. Further efforts are required to address financial and human resource constraints and inadequate support among physicians. Education should be given to health care professionals to improve the data quality. The establishment of decentralized surveillance networks can be an approach to improve timeliness for emerging infections.

TI  - Estimating CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from Large Scale Coal-Fired Power Plants Using OCO-2 Observations and Emission Inventories
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased rapidly worldwide, aggravating the global greenhouse effect, and coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions in China. However, efficient methods that can quantify CO2 emissions from individual coal-fired power plants with high accuracy are needed. In this study, we estimated the CO2 emissions of large-scale coal-fired power plants using Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite data based on remote sensing inversions and bottom-up methods. First, we mapped the distribution of coal-fired power plants, displaying the total installed capacity, and identified two appropriate targets, the Waigaoqiao and Qinbei power plants in Shanghai and Henan, respectively. Then, an improved Gaussian plume model method was applied for CO2 emission estimations, with input parameters including the geographic coordinates of point sources, wind vectors from the atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate, and OCO-2 observations. The application of the Gaussian model was improved by using wind data with higher temporal and spatial resolutions, employing the physically based unit conversion method, and interpolating OCO-2 observations into different resolutions. Consequently, CO2 emissions were estimated to be 23.06 +/- 2.82 (95% CI) Mt/yr using the Gaussian model and 16.28 Mt/yr using the bottom-up method for the Waigaoqiao Power Plant, and 14.58 +/- 3.37 (95% CI) and 14.08 Mt/yr for the Qinbei Power Plant, respectively. These estimates were compared with three standard databases for validation: the Carbon Monitoring for Action database, the China coal-fired Power Plant Emissions Database, and the Carbon Brief database. The comparison found that previous emission inventories spanning different time frames might have overestimated the CO2 emissions of one of two Chinese power plants on the two days that the measurements were made. Our study contributes to quantifying CO2 emissions from point sources and helps in advancing satellite-based monitoring techniques of emission sources in the future; this helps in reducing errors due to human intervention in bottom-up statistical methods.

TI  - Deep Residual Dual-Attention Network for Super-Resolution Reconstruction of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of remote sensing images is becoming a highly active area of research. With increasing upscaling factors, richer and more abundant details can progressively be obtained. However, in comparison with natural images, the complex spatial distribution of remote sensing data increases the difficulty in its reconstruction. Furthermore, most SR reconstruction methods suffer from low feature information utilization and equal processing of all spatial regions of an image. To improve the performance of SR reconstruction of remote sensing images, this paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based approach, named the deep residual dual-attention network (DRDAN), which achieves the fusion of global and local information. Specifically, we have developed a residual dual-attention block (RDAB) as a building block in DRDAN. In the RDAB, we firstly use the local multi-level fusion module to fully extract and deeply fuse the features of the different convolution layers. This module can facilitate the flow of information in the network. After this, a dual-attention mechanism (DAM), which includes both a channel attention mechanism and a spatial attention mechanism, enables the network to adaptively allocate more attention to regions carrying high-frequency information. Extensive experiments indicate that the DRDAN outperforms other comparable DCNN-based approaches in both objective evaluation indexes and subjective visual quality.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDevice-based reconstruction, the most common approach to breast reconstruction, typically occurs in 2 stages to allow for the breast envelope to be expanded serially before exchanging for a permanent implant. The AeroForm tissue expander is a carbon dioxide-based expansion system that allows for patient-initiated filling, and compared with the traditional saline expander, it has been shown to decrease the median time to full expansion and implant exchange. Furthermore, multiple changes have been incorporated into the newer V2.5 iteration resulting in reductions in device-related malfunctions, including overinflation.Case PresentationA 57-year-old woman who had a diagnosis of stage 1 ductal carcinoma in situ (T1c = 1.3 cm, ER/PR-negative, HER2-positive) underwent bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and V2.5 AeroForm expander reconstruction. The procedure and subsequent postoperative follow-up visits were unremarkable without complications. However, once she entered an magnetic resonance imaging examination room for evaluation of an incidentally found meningioma, the carbon dioxide reservoir valve in both expanders was suddenly activated, releasing filling gas and maximally inflating the device to its 800-mL capacity. She elected to retain the expanders, and they were exchanged for permanent silicone implants 1 month later.ConclusionsAlthough the V2.5 AeroForm expander is associated with a much lower rate of overinflation than its predecessor, our case suggests that autoexpansion remains of concern and likely occurs via a different mechanism when the device is subjected to clinical strength magnetic field. Clinicians should not order magnetic resonance imaging scans for women with AeroForm expanders due to the risk of unintended expansion.

TI  - Examining the Relationship Between College Students' Interworldview Friendships and Pluralism Orientation
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: One of the most influential factors shaping college students' prosocial development-the development of attitudes and behaviors that involve positive engagement within one's community and larger society-is the peer group. Friends have an especially important influence on students' learning and development because of the time and emotional investment friendship involves. While ample research documents the association between college students' friendships across racial differences and the development of prosocial attitudes and behaviors, the question of whether friendships across other social boundaries may also do so remains.Purpose: This study was guided by the theory of civic friendship, which posits that friendships that cross social boundaries (e.g., religion, race) can foster positive attitudes toward people of other social identity groups and a commitment to justice because of the solidarity and attention to injustice that develop within such relationships. We focused on friendships across the social boundary of worldview identity. More inclusive of secular and spiritual students than "religious identity," "worldview identity" is defined as a student's guiding life philosophy based on religious, spiritual, and/or non-religious perspective(s). Specifically, the purpose of our study was to examine the relationship between the number of interworldview friendships in the first year on campus and one particular prosocial attitude, pluralism orientation, which reflects acceptance of and active engagement with worldview diversity.Participants: We utilized Time 1 and Time 2 data from the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey (IDEALS), a national, longitudinal dataset comprised of 7,194 first-year students of diverse racial and worldview identities at 122 U.S. institutions.Research Design: We ran a series of blocked multilevel regression models to examine the relationship between the number of interworldview friendships and pluralism orientation at Time 2, controlling for four domains of variables shown in prior literature to also be associated with pluralism orientation.Results: Results revealed that, holding constant other predictors, the number of interworldview friendships in the first year on campus is positively associated with pluralism orientation.Conclusions: Our results provide additional support for the particularly powerful relationship between friendship across social differences and students' prosocial development. It is essential, therefore, that colleges and universities create conditions that will help students develop and solidify these vital relationships early in their collegiate journey. By supporting interworldview friendships among their students, colleges and universities are contributing to the creation of a more just and egalitarian society and a stronger democracy.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring and Evaluation of Vegetation Restoration in Grassland Mining Areas-A Case Study of the Shengli Mining Area in Xilinhot City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal production will cause serious damage to regional vegetation, especially in ecologically fragile grasslands. It is the consensus of all major countries to conduct vegetation restoration and management monitoring in areas damaged by coal production. This paper compares the adaptability of different data sources and different vegetation indices to grassland mining areas and proposes a normalized environmental vegetation index (NEVI) suitable for vegetation monitoring in grassland mining areas. Based on the Landsat and Sentinel data from 2005 to 2019, this paper uses NEVI to monitor the vegetation destruction and restoration of the Shengli mining area. The main result is that the vegetation restoration work in the Shengli mining area started in 2007 and was gradually carried out in subsequent years. The restoration effect of vegetation is significantly better in the east than in the west. The NEVI of the vegetation in the east can reach, or exceed, the level of natural vegetation in the same period. The restoration of vegetation degradation in some areas requires strengthening of management and maintenance measures.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The catastrophic implication of harmful algal bloom (HAB) events in the Arabian Gulf is a strong indication that the study of the spatiotemporal distribution of chlorophyll-a and its relationship with other variables is critical. This study analyzes the relationship between chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) and their trends in the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman along the United Arab Emirates coast. Additionally, the relationship between bathymetry and Chl-a and SST was examined. The MODIS Aqua product with a resolution of 1 x 1 km(2) was employed for both chlorophyll-a and SST covering a timeframe from 2003 to 2019. The highest concentration of chlorophyll-a was seen in the Strait of Hormuz with an average of 2.8 mg m(-3), which is 1.1 mg m(-3) higher than the average for the entire study area. Three-quarters of the study area showed a significant correlation between the Chl-a and SST. The shallow (deep) areas showed a strong positive (negative) correlation between the Chl-a and SST. The results indicate the presence of trends for both variables across most of the study area. SST significantly increased in more than two-thirds of the study area in the summer with no significant trends detected in the winter.

TI  - Utilizing the Available Open-Source Remotely Sensed Data in Assessing the Wildfire Ignition and Spread Capacities of Vegetated Surfaces in Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We bring a practical and comprehensive GIS-based framework to utilize freely available remotely sensed datasets to assess wildfire ignition probability and spreading capacities of vegetated landscapes. The study area consists of the country-level scale of the Romanian territory, characterized by a diversity of vegetated landscapes threatened by climate change. We utilize the Wildfire Ignition Probability/Wildfire Spreading Capacity Index (WIPI/WSCI). WIPI/WSCI models rely on a multi-criteria data mining procedure assessing the study area's social, environmental, geophysical, and fuel properties based on open access remotely sensed data. We utilized the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to weigh each indexing criterion's impact factor and assess the model's overall sensitivity. Introducing ROC analysis at an earlier stage of the workflow elevated the final Area Under the Curve (AUC) of WIPI from 0.705 to 0.778 and WSCI from 0.586 to 0.802. The modeling results enable discussion on the vulnerability of protected areas and the exposure of man-made structures to wildfire risk. Our study shows that within the wildland-urban interface of Bucharest's metropolitan area, there is a remarkable building stock of healthcare, residential and educational functions, which are significantly exposed and vulnerable to wildfire spreading risk.

AB  - The characteristic response of the marine environment to intense wind forcing is considered using a numerical coupled sea-atmosphere model. It is shown that the model reproduces cold sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies developing in the eastern part of the Black Sea on November 6-8, 2011, which were recorded in satellite data. The role of various mechanisms in the formation of these anomalies is quantitatively assessed and it is shown that the main factor that caused a sharp decrease in SST is wind mixing. The influence of the cold anomaly on the current velocity fields near the Caucasian coast is considered (in particular, the appearance of a cyclonic eddy in the sea and an increase in the velocity of the Black Sea Rim Current).

TI  - Statistical Modelling of SPADs for Time-of-Flight LiDAR
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-of-Flight (TOF) based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a widespread technique for distance measurements in both single-spot depth ranging and 3D mapping. Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) detectors provide single-photon sensitivity and allow in-pixel integration of a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) to measure the TOF of single-photons. From the repetitive acquisition of photons returning from multiple laser shots, it is possible to accumulate a TOF histogram, so as to identify the laser pulse return from unwelcome ambient light and compute the desired distance information. In order to properly predict the TOF histogram distribution and design each component of the LiDAR system, from SPAD to TDC and histogram processing, we present a detailed statistical modelling of the acquisition chain and we show the perfect matching with Monte Carlo simulations in very different operating conditions and very high background levels. We take into consideration SPAD non-idealities such as hold-off time, afterpulsing, and crosstalk, and we show the heavy pile-up distortion in case of high background. Moreover, we also model non-idealities of timing electronics chain, namely, TDC dead-time, limited number of storage cells for TOF data, and TDC sharing. Eventually, we show how the exploit the modelling to reversely extract the original LiDAR return signal from the distorted measured TOF data in different operating conditions.

TI  - Characterization of the Use of Emergency Contraception from Sentinel Pharmacies in a Region of Southern Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have been published suggesting that emergency contraception (EC) is used repeatedly, but a lack of information regarding the profile of users makes it difficult to evaluate actual consumer habits. The aim of this study was to obtain information regarding the profile of users who obtain EC and other factors that might play a role, and to provide criteria to evaluate and improve the strategies of current contraceptive programs. This was an observational one-year study based on surveillance data on the provision of EC to women of reproductive age in 60 community pharmacies in Catalonia, Spain. In total, 941 notifications of dispensation of EC in Catalonia were received. A total of 44.2% of users said it was not the first time that they had taken the medication (repeat user). The percentage of users who used condoms was lower in repeat users compared to first-time users (56.7% vs. 64.4%, p < 0.05). A total of 25.7% of users stated that they did not use any barrier contraceptive method. The use of natural methods in repeat users was 53.8% in the subgroup who requested the medication after 48 h, significantly higher than in users who obtained the medication within the first 24 h (p < 0.05). A high percentage of repeat users with risky sexual behaviors were detected, suggesting that new measures must be implemented to provide information for this method, together with educational and preventive strategies.

TI  - Estimating integrated measures of forage quality for herbivores by fusing optical and structural remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern herbivore ranges are expanding in response to a warming climate. Forage quality also influences herbivore distributions, but less is known about the effects of climate change on plant biochemical properties. Remote sensing could enable landscape-scale estimations of forage quality, which is of interest to wildlife managers. Despite the importance of integrated forage quality metrics like digestible protein (DP) and digestible dry matter (DDM), few studies investigate remote sensing approaches to estimate these characteristics. We evaluated how well DP and DDM could be estimated using hyperspectral remote sensing and assessed whether incorporating shrub structural metrics affected by browsing would improve our ability to predict DP and DDM. We collected canopy-level spectra, destructive-vegetation samples, and flew unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) in willow (Salix spp.) dominated areas in north central Alaska in July 2019. We derived vegetation canopy structural metrics from 3D point cloud data obtained from UAV imagery using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The best performing model for DP included a spectral vegetation index (SVI) that used a red-edge and shortwave infrared band, and shrub height variability (hvar; Nagelkerke R (2) = 0.81, root mean square error RMSE = 1.42%, cross validation rho = 0.88). DDM's best model included a SVI with a blue and a red band, the normalized difference red-edge index, and hvar (adjusted R (2) = 0.73, RMSE = 4.16%, cross validation rho = 0.80). Results from our study demonstrate that integrated forage quality metrics may be successfully quantified using hyperspectral remote sensing data, and that models based on those data may be improved by incorporating additional shrub structural metrics such as height variability. Modern airborne sensor platforms such as Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager provide opportunities to fuse data streams from both structural and optical data, which may enhance our ability to estimate and scale important foliar properties.

TI  - A Novel Method for Refocusing Moving Ships in SAR Images via ISAR Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an active microwave remote sensing device, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used in the field of marine surveillance. However, moving ships appear defocused in SAR images, which seriously affects the classification and identification of ships. Considering the three-dimensional (3-D) rotational motions (roll, pitch, and yaw) of the navigating ship, a novel method for refocusing moving ships in SAR images based on inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technique is proposed. First, a rectangular window is used to extract the defocused ship subimage. Next, the subimage is transformed into the ISAR equivalent echo domain, and the range migration and phase error caused by the identical movement of all ship scatterers are compensated. Then, the optimal imaging time can be selected by the maximum image contrast search method. Finally, the iterative adaptive approach (IAA) is used to obtain the image with high resolution. This method has satisfactory imaging performance in both azimuth resolution and image focus, and the amount of calculation is small due to the processing of subimages. Simulated data and Gaofen-3 real SAR data are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - A Novel Spatial Simulation Method for Mapping the Urban Forest Carbon Density in Southern China by the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest is an important component of terrestrial ecosystems and is highly related to global climate change. However, because of complex city landscapes, deriving the spatial distribution of urban forest carbon density and conducting accuracy assessments are difficult. This study proposes a novel spatial simulation method, optimized geographically weighted logarithm regression (OGWLR), using Landsat 8 data acquired by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and field survey data to map the forest carbon density of Shenzhen city in southern China. To verify the effectiveness of the novel method, multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were established for comparison. The results showed that OGWLR achieved the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.54) and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 13.28 Mg/ha) among all estimation models. In addition, OGWLR achieved a more consistent spatial distribution of carbon density with the actual situation. The carbon density of the forests in the study area was large in the central and western regions and coastal areas and small in the building and road areas. Therefore, this method can provide a new reference for urban forest carbon density estimation and mapping.

TI  - Predicting and assessing changes in NPP based on multi-scenario land use and cover simulations on the Loess Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is a major factor affecting net primary production (NPP). According to the LUCC of the Loess Plateau from 2005 to 2015, the LUCC patterns in 2025 in three scenarios were predicted by using the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. Furthermore, taking the average NPP of various land use/cover types in 16 years as the reference scale, the changes in NPP in multi-scenario simulations are predicted and analyzed, and the impact of different land use/cover transfers on NPP is quantified. The results are as follows: (1) The land use/cover changes greatly in the baseline and fast development scenarios, and changes relatively little in the ecological protection scenarios. (2) The changes in NPP in different scenarios reflected the significant difference in the ecological protection effect. All the three scenarios promote an NPP increase, but the ecological protection scenario can promote NPP increases the most. (3) The changes in NPP caused by LUCC in the three scenarios reflected the significant difference in the various land use/cover types protection effect. Analyzing and predicting NPP changes in multi-scenario LUCC simulations in the future can provide a theoretical basis for decision makers to judge the future changes in ecological environments and ecological protection effects against different policy backgrounds.

TI  - The Dynamics of Hongjian Nur, the Largest Desert Freshwater Lake in China, during 1990-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China's largest desert freshwater lake, Hongjian Nur (HN), which is the largest habitat of relict gull (Larus relictus), has rapidly changed in recent years. However, it is difficult to quantitatively monitor the dynamics of the lake and determine the causes of its changes due to the lack of in situ observation. In this study, a remote sensing-based approach was utilized to overcome these limitations. The monthly water areas during 1990-2017 were first extracted from Landsat multispectral images via an improved method based on the floating algae index (FAI). Then, lake surface elevations measured by real-time kinematics (RTK) were used to calculate the variations in the water storage of HN. Finally, the driving factors of the rapidly changed HN in different periods were investigated by correlation analysis. The result indicated that the drivers affecting the water storage of HN in different periods were not the same. Climate change was the main driving factor of lake level fluctuation during the HN relatively stable stage (1990-1998). Drought and the intensification of human activities were the main factors for the rapid shrinkage of the HN during 1999-2010. Human activities, especially coal-related industries and reservoir impoundment, likely was the primary factors driving the decrease in the water storage of HN from 2010 to 2015. After 2015, the policies that decreased the water consumed by human activities formulated by the government and humid climate were the main factor for the expansion of HN.

TI  - Vertical structure of cloud radiative heating in the tropics: confronting the EC-Earth v3.3.1/3P model with satellite observations
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the coupling of clouds to large-scale circulation is one of the grand challenges for the global climate research community. In this context, realistically modelling the vertical structure of cloud radiative heating (CRH) and/or cooling in Earth system models is a key premise to understand this coupling. Here, we evaluate CRH in two versions of the European Community Earth System Model (EC-Earth) using retrievals derived from the combined radar and lidar data from the CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellites. One model version is also used with two different horizontal resolutions. Our study evaluates large-scale intraseasonal variability in the vertical structure of CRH and cloud properties and investigates the changes in CRH during different phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a process that dominates the interannual climate variability in the tropics.EC-Earth generally captures both the intraseasonal and meridional pattern of variability in CRH over the convectively active and stratocumulus regions and the CRH during the positive and negative phases of ENSO. However, two key differences between model simulations and satellite retrievals emerge. First, the magnitude of CRH, in the upper troposphere, over the convectively active zones is up to twice as large in the models compared to the satellite data. Further dissection of net CRH into its shortwave and longwave components reveals noticeable differences in their vertical structure. The shortwave component of the radiative heating is overestimated by all model versions in the lower-most troposphere and underestimated in the middle troposphere. These over- and underestimates of shortwave heating are partly compensated by an overestimate of longwave cooling in the lowermost troposphere and heating in the middle troposphere. The biases in CRH can be traced back to disagreement in cloud amount and cloud water content. There is no noticeable improvement of CRH by increasing the horizontal resolution in the model alone. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating models with satellite observations that resolve the vertical structure of clouds and cloud properties.

TI  - Current allocations and target apportionment for HIV testing and treatment services for marginalized populations: characterizing PEPFAR investment and strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is a large bilateral funder of the global HIV response whose policy decisions on key populations (KPs) programming determine the shape of the key populations' response in many countries. Understanding the size and relative share of PEPFAR funds going to KPs and the connection between PEPFAR's targets and resulting programming is crucial for successfully serving key populations. Methods Publicly available PEPFAR budgets for key populations' services were assessed by country and geographical region for all 52 countries with budget data in fiscal year (FY) 2020. For the 23 countries which completed a full planning process in FY 2018 and 2019, PEPFAR targets for HIV testing and treatment initiation for key populations were assessed. Expenditures for KP programming were calculated to determine whether shifts in targets translated into programming. Implementing partners were characterized by the level of specialization using the share of assigned targets made up by KPs. The average target per year and implementing partner was calculated for each KP group and indicator. Results PEPFAR country KP budgets ranged from US$35,000 to $15.2 million, and the proportion of funding to key populations varied by region, with Eastern and Southern African countries having the lowest proportion. Between FY 2018 and 2019, the KP targets for HIV testing and treatment among KPs increased, whereas expenditures on key populations decreased from US$115.4 to $111.0 million. Of the 11 countries with an increase in HIV testing targets, seven had a decrease in KP expenditures. Of the nine countries with an increase in treatment initiation targets, five had a decrease in KP expenditures. The proportion of targets assigned to partners which do not specialize in key populations increased from FY 2018 to 2019. Conclusions Current key population policies have not resulted in a tight connection between targets and expenditures. This includes assigning a large proportion of key populations programming to partners who do not specialize in key populations, which may weaken the performance management role of the targets. These results signal that a new approach to key populations programming is needed.

TI  - Annual and 16-Day Rangeland Production Estimates for the Western United States
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland production is a foundational ecosystem service and resource on which livestock, wildlife, and people depend. Capitalizing on recent advancements in the use of remote sensing data across rangelands, we provide estimates of herbaceous rangeland production from 1986 to 2019 at 16-d and annual time steps and 30-m resolution across the western United States. A factorial comparison of this dataset and three national scale datasets is presented, and we highlight a multiple-lines-of-evidence approach when using production estimates in decision making. Herbaceous aboveground biomass at this scale and resolution provides critical information applicable for management and decision making, particularly in the face of annual grass invasion and woody encroachment of rangeland systems. These readily available data remove analytical and technological barriers allowing immediate utilization for monitoring and management. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) in Deriving Suspended Sediment Concentrations in the Ocean From MTG/FCI Satellite Sensor
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity to monitor suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the ocean, from surface to bottom, using data acquired by the future Meteosat Third-Generation (MTG)/flexible combined imager (FCI) satellite sensor has been quantified by observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). The x201C;truex201D; ocean state for these experiments is based on a 15-month numerical simulation of hydrodynamic and sediment transport, configured to represent the highly dynamical waters of the English Channel under the influences of tides and waves. Simulated MTG/FCI hourly averaged acquisitions at a given location near the Isle of Wight have been processed via hidden Markov model combined with a statistical classificationx2014;based on self-organizing mapsx2014;of predicted vertical SSC profiles. The resulting experiments demonstrated that MTG/FCI images, despite their high temporal resolution, and because of many gaps due to nights and clouds over the English Channel, still require spatial interpolations to enhance the amount of information available at a given location. For an accurate determination of particle concentrations, time series of the main forcing (wind, tides, and waves) need to be included in the process: 1) as a crucial parameter correlated with the dynamics of large particles (sands) and 2) as an equally important parameter as satellite data themselves in the correlation with the dynamics of fine particles (silts).

TI  - Leveraging Deep Neural Networks to Map Caribou Lichen in High-Resolution Satellite Images Based on a Small-Scale, Noisy UAV-Derived Map
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lichen is an important food source for caribou in Canada. Lichen mapping using remote sensing (RS) images could be a challenging task, however, as lichens generally appear in unevenly distributed, small patches, and could resemble surficial features. Moreover, collecting lichen labeled data (reference data) is expensive, which restricts the application of many robust supervised classification models that generally demand a large quantity of labeled data. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of using a very-high-spatial resolution (1-cm) lichen map of a small sample site (e.g., generated based on a single UAV scene and using field data) to train a subsequent classifier to map caribou lichen over a much larger area (similar to 0.04 km(2) vs. similar to 195 km(2)) and a lower spatial resolution image (in this case, a 50-cm WorldView-2 image). The limited labeled data from the sample site were also partially noisy due to spatial and temporal mismatching issues. For this, we deployed a recently proposed Teacher-Student semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach (based on U-Net and U-Net++ networks) involving unlabeled data to assist with improving the model performance. Our experiments showed that it was possible to scale-up the UAV-derived lichen map to the WorldView-2 scale with reasonable accuracy (overall accuracy of 85.28% and F1-socre of 84.38%) without collecting any samples directly in the WorldView-2 scene. We also found that our noisy labels were partially beneficial to the SSL robustness because they improved the false positive rate compared to the use of a cleaner training set directly collected within the same area in the WorldView-2 image. As a result, this research opens new insights into how current very high-resolution, small-scale caribou lichen maps can be used for generating more accurate large-scale caribou lichen maps from high-resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - A Conflict between Traditional Flood Measures and Maintaining River Ecosystems? A Case Study Based upon the River LÆrdal, Norway
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the most damaging of natural disasters, and flood events are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency with the effects of climate change and changes in land use. As a consequence, much focus has been placed on the engineering of structural flood mitigation measures in rivers. Traditional flood protection measures, such as levees and dredging of the river channel, threaten floodplains and river ecosystems, but during the last decade, sustainable reconciliation of freshwater ecosystems has increased. However, we still find many areas where these traditional measures are proposed, and it is challenging to find tools for evaluation of different measures and quantification of the possible impacts. In this paper, we focus on the river L AE rdal in Norway to (i) present the dilemma between traditional flood measures and maintaining river ecosystems and (ii) quantify the efficiency and impact of different solutions based on 2D hydraulic models, remote sensing data, economics, and landscape metrics. Our results show that flood measures may be in serious conflict with environmental protection and legislation to preserve biodiversity and key nature types.

TI  - Identification of Construction Areas from VHR-Satellite Images for Macroeconomic Forecasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution focuses on the utilization of very-high-resolution (VHR) images to identify construction areas and their temporal changes aiming to estimate the investment in construction as a basis for economic forecasts. Triggered by the need to improve macroeconomic forecasts and reduce their time intervals, the idea arose to use frequently available information derived from satellite imagery. For the improvement of macroeconomic forecasts, the period to detect changes between two points in time needs to be rather short because early identification of such investments is beneficial. Therefore, in this study, it is of interest to identify and quantify new construction areas, which will turn into build-up areas later. A multiresolution segmentation followed by a kNN classification is applied to WorldView images from an area around the southern part of Berlin, Germany. Specific material compositions of construction areas result in typical classification patterns different from other land cover classes. A GIS-based analysis follows to extract specific temporal "patterns of life" in construction areas. With the early identification of such patterns of life, it is possible to predict construction areas that will turn into real estate later. This information serves as an input for macroeconomic forecasts to support quicker forecasts in future.

M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the Mongolian Plateau as the study area, the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) and the land surface temperature ( LST) in the growing season from 2000 to 2019 were used to construct the NDVI-LST feature space, and based on which the temperature vegetation dryness index ( TVDI) of the Mongolian Plateau was calculated. We used Theil-Sen Median trend analysis, Mann -Kendall test, and Hurst index method to analyze the spatial and temporal variations and future trends of TVDI on the Mongolian Plateau. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between meteorological factors and TVDI on the Mongolian Plateau using partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the TVDI of the Mongolian Plateau during 2000-2019 showed an increasing trend with a rate of 0.0001 ", indicating that the Mongolian Plateau ' s drought condition became heavier slightly in the last 20 years. The drought condition in meadow steppe and typical steppe gradually decreased, and that in desert steppe and alpine grassland was increased. The average Hurst index of TVDI in the growing season was 0.45, and the area with TVDI less than 0.5 accounted for 71.5% of the total area, which indicated that the TVDI during 2000-2019 in most areas turned opposite to the past. In the future, the drought condition in the central desert steppe area and the eastern meadow steppe area might increase, and that in most of the typical steppe and the desert steppe in Inner Mongolia tended to decrease. The drought change in the alpine grassland area was uncertain. There was a significant positive correlation between the TVDI and temperature in 33.6% area of the Mongolian Plateau and a significant negative correlation between the TVDI and precipitation in 34.8% of the area. Moreover, the meteorological factors heavily affected the typical steppe.

TI  - Normalizing the Local Incidence Angle in Sentinel-1 Imagery to Improve Leaf Area Index, Vegetation Height, and Crop Coefficient Estimations
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Public domain synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly from Sentinel-1, has widened the scope of day and night vegetation monitoring, even when cloud cover limits optical Earth observation. Yet, it is challenging to combine SAR images acquired at different incidence angles and from ascending and descending orbits because of the backscatter dependence on the incidence angle. This study demonstrates two transformations that facilitate collective use of Sentinel-1 imagery, regardless of the acquisition geometry, for agricultural monitoring of several crops in Israel (wheat, processing tomatoes, and cotton). First, the radar backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) was multiplied by the local incidence angle (theta) of every pixel. This transformation improved the empirical prediction of the crop coefficient (K-c), leaf area index (LAI), and crop height in all three crops. The second method, which is based on the radar brightness coefficient (beta(0)), proved useful for estimating K-c, LAI, and crop height in processing tomatoes and cotton. Following the suggested transformations, R-2 increased by 0.0172 to 0.668, and RMSE improved by 5 to 52%. Additionally, the models based on the suggested transformations were found to be superior to the models based on the dual-polarization radar vegetation index (RVI). Consequently, vegetation monitoring using SAR imagery acquired at different viewing geometries became more effective.

TI  - Comparison of Five Different Electrophysiological Criteria for Childhood Guillain Barre Syndrome
T2  - ANNALS OF INDIAN ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Internationally approved electrodiagnostic criteria for Guillain Barre syndrome lack in children. We intended to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the currently available five electrophysiological criteria for childhood Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) at the time of sentinel assessment. Methodology: In this single-center study, data of children diagnosed with GBS between January 2013 to December 2017 were retrieved. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical features, electrophysiological recordings. The electrodiagnostic results (4 motor nerves and two sensory nerves in upper limbs and lower limbs) were reanalyzed and were classified based on Dutch group; Ho; Hadden; Hughes and Rajabally criteria for GBS. Results: During this study period, of the 205 children with clinical features of GBS, 15 children had incomplete electrophysiological data, and four children were excluded due to missing data. The mean age of onset of the 186 children enrolled was 77 months; the median duration from symptom onset to electrodiagnostic evaluation was seven days; pure motor and motor-sensory form of GBS was seen in 71 and 115 children. Based on the Hadden criteria, a demyelinating pattern was noted in 57 children; axonal in 37; Inexcitable in 84 and Equivocal in 8 children. The sensitivity of the various criteria ranged from 71% to 100% for demyelination, 97% to 100% for axonal. The degree of agreement using Hadden and Rajabally criteria for Equivocal subtypes was 0.93. Conclusions: The Rajabally criteria showed the best sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for electrodiagnosis of GBS in children when compared against Hadden criteria.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation of <i>NO</i><sub>2</sub> Vertical Column Densities (VCDs) over Poland: Comparison of the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Observations and the GEM-AQ Model Simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOMI instrument aboard Sentinel-5P is a relatively new, high-resolution source of information about atmosphere composition. One of the primary atmospheric trace gases that we can observe is nitrogen dioxide. Thanks to TROPOMI capabilities (high resolution and short revisit time), one can describe regional and seasonal NO2 concentration patterns. Thus far, such patterns have been analysed by either ground measurements (which have been limited to specific locations and only to the near-surface troposphere layer) or numerical models. This paper compares the TROPOMI and GEM-AQ derived vertical column densities (VCD) over Poland, focusing on large point sources. Although well established in atmospheric science, the GEM-AQ simulations are always based on emission data, which in the case of the energy sector were reported by stack operators. In addition, we checked how cloudy conditions influence TROPOMI results. Finally, we tried to link the NO2 column number densities with surface concentration using boundary layer height as an additional explanatory variable. Our results showed a general underestimation of NO2 tropospheric column number density by the GEM-AQ model (compared to the TROPOMI). However, for the locations of the most significant point sources, we noticed a systematic overestimation by the GEM-AQ model (excluding spring and summer months when TROPOMI presents larger NO2 VCDs than GEM-AQ). For the winter months, we have found TROPOMI NO2 VCD results highly dependent on the choice of qa_value threshold.

TI  - Active/Passive Multiple Polarization Sea Ice Detection During Initial Freeze-Up
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for ice/water detection of ice less than 30 cm in thickness (thin ice) using dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and passive microwave data has been developed based on insights from previous work. The frequency chosen from those available was in the C-band. For the radiometer layer ice concentrations, land contaminated pixels were removed. For the SAR layers, a novel approach to their use in ice detection was developed using the coefficient of variation (COV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the normalized radar cross section to the mean. The COV reduced the complicated signatures of breaking waves and thin ice to bright ice pixels on a dark water background. The co-pol and cross-pol COV layers and the radiometer layer were merged according to physics-based rules, except in regions adjacent to land or the ice edge where only the SAR layers were valid. The detection algorithm was applied to 233 Sentinel 1a and 1b dual-polarization images of the freeze-up from 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. The synergistic ice retrievals showed improved agreement with manual operational analyses in the marginal ice zone over other automated operational products.

TI  - Wild Zebrafish Sentinels: Biological Monitoring of Site Differences Using Behavior and Morphology
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental change poses a devastating risk to human and environmental health. Rapid assessment of water conditions is necessary for monitoring, evaluating, and addressing this global health danger. Sentinels or biological monitors can be deployed in the field using minimal resources to detect water quality changes in real time, quickly and cheaply. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are ideal sentinels for detecting environmental changes due to their biomedical tool kit, widespread geographic distribution, and well-characterized phenotypic responses to environmental disturbances. Here, we demonstrate the utility of zebrafish sentinels by characterizing phenotypic differences in wild zebrafish between two field sites in India. Site 1 was a rural environment with flowing water, low-hypoxic conditions, minimal human-made debris, and high iron and lead concentrations. Site 2 was an urban environment with still water, hypoxic conditions, plastic pollution, and high arsenic, iron, and chromium concentrations. We found that zebrafish from Site 2 were smaller, more cohesive, and less active than Site 1 fish. We also found sexually dimorphic body shapes within the Site 2, but not the Site 1, population. Advancing zebrafish sentinel research and development will enable rapid detection, evaluation, and response to emerging global health threats.

TI  - Value searches of the globalizing world
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the theoretical understanding of the trends and value priorities of modern society. The global world dictates to a person new conditions for development and value reorientation associated with transformational processes in information cyberspace. The changes taking place in the consumer society are associated with social, economic and cultural conditions. There is a change in the established spiritual values and human needs for values of a one-dimensional, pragmatic and utilitarian sense. Various ways of value reassessment of the current trends in society, which would contribute to the formation of sustainable development on the basis of an adequate worldview search for alternative ways of developing the future world, are considered. The methodological basis of this study is the positions and conclusions of leading Western and Russian scientists who have paid great attention to the problems of global transformations in the modern world, which are closely related to the formation of a system of values. The study uses elements of a transdisciplinary paradigm that combines theoretical and methodological principles of system-structural, functional and comparative analysis, allowing us to trace the development of modern social relations against the background of the crisis of the global value system. The use of structural-functional and comparative methods helped to reveal the specifics and interconnectedness of value preferences in different cultures, made it possible to analyze the features of the contradictory sociocultural space of modern society and identify its main axiological characteristics. The modern information society generates a completely different worldview and environment of activity, where the value system directly depends on intelligence and knowledge, and information becomes a strategic resource of society.

TI  - Mining-induced Land Subsidence Detected by Sentinel-1 SAR Images: An Example from the Historical Tadeusz Kosciuszko Salt Mine at Wapno, Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland
T2  - INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many mines in Poland that have been in operation for over 100 years, with the Tadeusz Kosciuszko mine being a large salt mine in Wapno, northern Poland. The mine was closed in 1977 due to the greatest catastrophe in the history of Polish mining, but in the first days of 2021, a very large hole has been created in this area due to land subsidence. This article uses InSAR technology with Sentinel-1 images to determine settlement and ongoing deformation in this mine. The study results are useful for policymakers, managers, and authorities because land subsidence has caused serious and dangerous effects on people living in the area. The results processed by the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) method with the Sentinel Application Platform and the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers software packages show that deformation in the Wapno village area has been detected in both residential and non-residential areas, with maximum subsidence of up to -19 mm/yr. The subsidence in the mine reaches -12 mm/yr, and that at surrounding area range from 0 to -18.8 mm/yr.

TI  - Use of A MODIS Satellite-Based Aridity Index to Monitor Drought Conditions in Mongolia from 2001 to 2013
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 4D disasters (desertification, drought, dust, and dzud, a Mongolian term for severe winter weather) have recently been increasing in Mongolia, and their impacts on the livelihoods of humans has likewise increased. The combination of drought and dzud has caused the loss of livestock on which nomadic herdsmen depend for their well-being. Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of drought and predicting drought conditions are important goals of scientific research in Mongolia. This study involved examining the trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and satellite-based aridity index (SbAI) to determine why the land surface of Mongolia has recently (2001-2013) become drier across a range of aridity indices (AIs). The main reasons were that the maximum NDVI (NDVImax) was lower than the NDVImax typically found in other arid regions of the world, and the SbAI throughout the year was large (dry), although the SbAI in summer was comparatively small (wet). Under the current conditions, the capacity of the land surface to retain water throughout the year caused a large SbAI because rainfall in Mongolia is concentrated in the summer, and the conditions of grasslands reflect summer rainfall in addition to grazing pressure. We then proposed a method to monitor the land-surface dryness or drought using only satellite data. The correct identification of drought was higher for the SbAI. Drought is more strongly correlated with soil moisture anomalies, and thus the annual averaged SbAI might be appropriate for monitoring drought during seasons. Degraded land area, defined as annual NDVImax < 0.2 and annual averaged SbAI > 0.025, has decreased. Degraded land area was large in the major drought years of Mongolia.

TI  - WORLD VIEW AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON IN THE ORDINARY PERCEPTION OF THE RUSSIANS
T2  - PSIKHOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article, everyday consciousness is considered as a factor reflecting the general state of society, which is generated by the individual and group experience of generations, is used by subjects of life in order to adapt to reality. The problem of the study is the position that everyday consciousness contains both logically verified and largely erroneous opinions, subject to emotional assessments, and the introduction of new qualities into the individual consciousness is a laborious process. All these positions allow the authors to consider world outlook ideas (the meaning-forming component of everyday consciousness) as a historical and cultural feature of peoples. As the main methodological approach, an appeal to the linguistic paradigm of scientific analysis was chosen: the authors turn to the allocation of semantic categories in texts and their quantitative analysis, which makes it possible to identify the systemic properties of the phenomenon, as well as the hierarchical ordering of its constituent elements. The work also highlights the dominant among Russian users worldview attitudes associated with various spheres of human and social life. It is shown that the leading positions in the statements of users are the social and personal significance of the worldview. The work also examines the psychological components of the phenomenon (cognitive, value, emotional and conative) and their characteristic features that perform the functions of regulating behavior in modem conditions of human and social life. The analysis of emotional assessments in the statements of users allowed us to describe nine different subgroups of the emotional background, to show the main meaningful concepts that underlie them, to demonstrate the clear dominance of the negative emotional background. The presented analysis allows us to formulate a methodological approach to the study of the life of a person and society, which consists in identifying the units of analysis of a specific psychological phenomenon from the products of oral folk art and its subsequent quantitative and qualitative analysis by referring to automated systems analysis of a large number of texts that are not amenable to "manual" analysis in the force of its excessive volume. The theoretical and methodological positions described above allow us to reflect on the main meanings that the phenomenon of "worldview" is endowed with in the framework of everyday consciousness, to show that the worldview has a high level of abstraction, and its research has significant applied meaning. It is noted that ignoring this phenomenon within the framework of psychological concepts can lead to a fragmentary interpretation of many psychological phenomena.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite advances in melanoma management, there remains room for improvement in the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy. The authors analyzed a prospective cohort of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green fluorescence to evaluate the quality and accuracy of this technique.Methods: Consecutive primary cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green fluorescence from 2012 to 2018 were prospectively enrolled. Analysis was performed of melanoma characteristics, means of identifying sentinel lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node status, and recurrence.Results: Five hundred ninety-four melanomas and 1827 nodes were analyzed; 1556 nodes (85.2 percent) were identified by radioactivity/fluorescence, 255 (14 percent) by radioactivity only, and 16 (0.9 percent) with indocyanine green only. There were 163 positive sentinel nodes. One hundred forty-seven (90.2 percent) were identified by radioactivity/fluorescence, 13 (8 percent) by radioactivity only, and three (0.6 percent) with fluorescence only. Of the 128 patients with a positive biopsy, eight patients' (6.3 percent) nodes were identified by radioactivity only and four (3.4 percent) with fluorescence only. There were 128 patients with a positive biopsy, 454 with a negative biopsy, and 12 patients who had a negative biopsy with subsequent nodal recurrence. Mean follow-up was 2.8 years.Conclusions: In the study of the largest cohort of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy with radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green-based technology, the quality and accuracy of this technique are demonstrated. This has important implications for melanoma patients, as the adoption of this approach with subsequent accurate staging, adjuvant workup, and treatment may improve survival outcomes.

TI  - Applying Remotely Sensed Environmental Information to Model Mosquito Populations
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vector borne diseases have been related to various environmental parameters and environmental changes like climate change, which impact their propagation in time and space. Remote sensing data have been used widely for monitoring environmental conditions and changes. We hypothesized that changes in various environmental parameters may be reflected in changes in mosquito population size, thus impacting the temporal and spatial patterns of vector diseases. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of environmental variables on mosquito populations using the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) obtained from Landsat 8, along with other factors, such as altitude and water covered areas surrounding the examined locations. Therefore, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was developed and tested for its ability to predict mosquito populations. The model was applied in NE Greece using mosquito population data from 17 locations where mosquito traps were placed from June to October 2019. All performance metrics indicated a high predictive ability of the model. LST was proved to be the factor with the highest relative importance in the prediction of mosquito populations, whereas the developed model can predict mosquito populations 13 days ahead to allow a substantial window for appropriate control measures.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the frequency and nature of occult injury screening in infants with subconjunctival hemorrhages (SCH), the incidence of occult injuries in these children, and the factors that may have influenced the decision to screen for additional injury.Methods: Infants aged 14 days to 6 months with SCH who presented to two tertiary pediatric centers were identified from a local database (N = 84). A retrospective chart review collected demographics, examination findings, and imaging results. Infants were further stratified into two groups depending on the presence of additional mucocutaneous injuries. The groups were compared with two-sample t testing.Results: Skeletal surveys were completed in 31% of patients overall, but the rate of screening was significantly higher among patients who presented with SCH and additional mucocutaneous injuries as opposed to SCH alone. However, the presence of additional mucocutaneous injuries was not associated with an increased risk for positive skeletal survey.Conclusions: Rates of occult injury screening among infants with SCH were low and were significantly influenced by the presence of additional injuries. When screening was conducted, occult injuries were commonly identified. Future studies should assess the true prevalence of abuse in this population.

TI  - Methodological Problems of Studying the Underwater Relief in the River Delta from Space Images (on the Example of Mapping the Shallows of the Yenisei River Delta)
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on images from the Sentinel-2 satellite taken in 2017-2019, a map of shallows in the Yenisei delta was compiled. This paper highlighted the methodological problems that arise at using satellite images for research and mapping of underwater relief; the ways of their solution are offered. Consideration of the depth of penetration of sunlight into the water and analysis of the spectral brightness of underwater objects allow for the determination of the spectrum zone (red zone) optimal for interpreting sandy riverbanks and options for color synthesis. At a limited choice of cloudless images in the Arctic to have images obtained during the minimum water level, not only the imaging season (low-water period) but also interannual runoff fluctuations are taken into account. The water turbidity limits the possibility to interpret the underwater relief. Images obtained with minimal turbidity are selected, and in the case of spreading of turbid waters, multi-temporal images are compared to separate the image of volatile turbid waters from more stable bottom objects; color synthesis is applied at different times. The identification of sandbanks, ridged forms of relief, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpreting based on the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. The identification of sandbanks, ridged relief forms on them, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpretation of the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. To highlight the fuzzy boundaries between the shallows and core zones of streams, the brightness quantization of images is applied. Comparison of the Yenisei River delta shallows map compiled from modern photographs with topographic and pilot maps of the 1970-1980th shows a reduction in the area of shallows adjacent to the tips of large islands in the eastern part of the delta. This is in accordance with earlier revealed activation of the erosion of the banks of the branches of the Yenisei delta in the XXI century.

TI  - Arctic-Boreal Lake Phenology Shows a Relationship between Earlier Lake Ice-Out and Later Green-Up
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has transformed our understanding of Earth processes. One component of the Earth system where large uncertainties remain are Arctic and boreal freshwater lakes. With only short periods of open water due to annual ice cover, lake productivity in these regions is extremely sensitive to warming induced changes in ice cover. At the same time, productivity dynamics in these lakes vary enormously, even over short distances, making it difficult to understand these potential changes. A major impediment to an improved understanding of lake dynamics has been sparsely distributed field measurements, in large part due to the complexity and expense of conducting scientific research in remote northern latitudes. This project overcomes that hurdle by using a new set of 'eyes in the sky', the Planet Labs CubeSat fleet, to observe 35 lakes across 3 different arctic-boreal ecoregions in western North America. We extract time series of lake reflectance to identify ice-out and green-up across three years (2017-2019). We find that lakes with later ice-out have significantly faster green-ups. Our results also show ice-out varies latitudinally by 38 days from south to north, but only varies across years by similar to 9 days. In contrast, green-up varied between years by 22 days in addition to showing significant spatial variability. We compare PlanetScope to Sentinel-2 data and independently validate our ice-out estimates, finding an ice-out mean absolute difference (MAD) similar to 9 days. This study demonstrates the potential of using CubeSat imagery to monitor the timing and magnitude of ice-off and green-up at high spatiotemporal resolution.

TI  - The Role of Salinity in the Global Distribution of Surface Density Fluxes in the World Ocean Based on the Example of 2014
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have analyzed the dependence of the calculated magnitudes of buoyancy fluxes at the ocean surface on the various sources of information used about salinity based on the example of 2014 with anomalous convection in the Labrador Sea. In particular, we have used the NCEP CFSv2 reanalysis, Aquarius satellite data, and ISAS-15 dataset based on the Argo network of profiling floats. In boreal winter, NCEP CFSv2 shows the highest salinity in subequatorial and tropical latitudes and in the eastern Indian and western Pacific Ocean as compared to other datasets. In boreal summer, the salinity according to the reanalysis is the lowest in the Bay of Bengal. Significant discrepancies between CFSv2 and ISAS-15 are also revealed in the subpolar latitudes of the Northern/Southern Hemisphere in boreal/austral winter. Negative biases in salinity correspond to positive biases in the density flux (which is the inverse of the buoyancy flux) in subpolar latitudes, while this is not necessarily the case in other regions. It is shown that the mesoscale variability of salinity exerts an insignificant effect on density fluxes (up to 1% of mean values) compared to the effect of the various salinity datasets used (up to 10% of the mean values), the largest differences being revealed in low and middle latitudes, where the impact of precipitation is high. The obtained data on the role of nonlinear effects related to mesoscale variability in the salinity represent a methodological basis for studying the long-term variability of surface density fluxes and surface water transformation, using monthly mean salinity.

TI  - A Long-Term Spatiotemporal Analysis of Vegetation Greenness over the Himalayan Region Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayas constitute one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems in the Indian sub-continent. Vegetation greenness driven by climate in the Himalayan region is often overlooked as field-based studies are challenging due to high altitude and complex topography. Although the basic information about vegetation cover and its interactions with different hydroclimatic factors is vital, limited attention has been given to understanding the response of vegetation to different climatic factors. The main aim of the present study is to analyse the relationship between the spatiotemporal variability of vegetation greenness and associated climatic and hydrological drivers within the Upper Khoh River (UKR) Basin of the Himalayas at annual and seasonal scales. We analysed two vegetation indices, namely, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time-series data, for the last 20 years (2001-2020) using Google Earth Engine. We found that both the NDVI and EVI showed increasing trends in the vegetation greening during the period under consideration, with the NDVI being consistently higher than the EVI. The mean NDVI and EVI increased from 0.54 and 0.31 (2001), respectively, to 0.65 and 0.36 (2020). Further, the EVI tends to correlate better with the different hydroclimatic factors in comparison to the NDVI. The EVI is strongly correlated with ET with r(2) = 0.73 whereas the NDVI showed satisfactory performance with r(2) = 0.45. On the other hand, the relationship between the EVI and precipitation yielded r(2) = 0.34, whereas there was no relationship was observed between the NDVI and precipitation. These findings show that there exists a strong correlation between the EVI and hydroclimatic factors, which shows that changes in vegetation phenology can be better captured using the EVI than the NDVI.

TI  - Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide for Identifying Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Feasibility Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a well-established procedure for staging clinically node-negative early breast cancer (BC). Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) demonstrated efficacy for nodal identification using a magnetic probe after local retroaeroal interstitial injection. Its benefits lie in its flexibility, which is an essential property in the global setting, where access to the isotope is difficult. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the SPIO for SLNB in BC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Seventy-four female patients were included. The median time of lymph node retrieval was 20 min. The median number of resected sentinel nodes (SNs) was 4. SN was detected in all patients. No serious adverse event was observed. SPIO in identifying SN in BC patients after NAC is feasible and oncologically safe.

TI  - Assessment of the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Cover Crops Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover cropping is a conservation practice that helps to alleviate soil health problems and reduce nutrient losses. Understanding the spatial variability in historic and current adoption of cover cropping practices and their impacts on soil, water, and nutrient dynamics at a landscape scale is an important step in determining and prioritizing areas in a watershed to effectively utilize this practice. However, such data are lacking. Our objective was to develop a spatial and temporal inventory of winter cover cropping practices in the Maumee River watershed using images collected by Landsat satellites (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) from 2008 to 2019 in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Each year, satellite images collected during cover crop growing season (i.e., between October and April) were converted into two seasonal composites based on cover crop phenology. Using these composites, various image-based covariates were extracted for 628 ground-truth (field) data. By integrating ground-truth and image-based covariates, a cover crop classification model based on a random forest (RF) algorithm was developed, trained and validated in GEE platform. Our classification scheme differentiated four cover crop categories: Winter Hardy, Winter Kill, Spring Emergent, and No Cover. The overall classification accuracy was 75%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.63. The results showed that more than 50% of the corn-soybean areas in the Maumee River watershed were without winter crops during 2008-2019 period. It was found that 2019/2020 and 2009/2010 were the years with the largest and lowest cover crop areas, with 34% and 10% in the watershed, respectively. The total cover cropping area was then assessed in relation to fall precipitation and cumulative growing degree days (GDD). There was no apparent increasing trend in cover crop areas between 2008 and 2019, but the variability in cover crops areas was found to be related to higher accumulated GDD and fall precipitation. A detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of cover crops using GEE could help in promoting site-specific management practices to enhance their environmental benefits. This also has significance to policy makers and funding agencies as they could use the information to localize areas in need of interventions for supporting adoption of cover cropping practice.

TI  - Aggressions on Social Networks: What Are the Implications for Healthcare Providers? An Exploratory Research
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Incidents of violence by healthcare users against staff have been considered as sentinel events. New forms of aggression, i.e., cyberbullying, have emerged with the advent of social networks. Medical literature includes some reports about workplace cyberbullying on nurses and young doctors by colleagues/supervisors, but not by users. To investigate cyberbullying on healthcare providers via social networks, we carried out an exploratory quali-quantitative study, researching and analyzing posts and comments relating to a local Health Trust (ASL5) in Italy, published from 2013 until May 2020 on healthcare worker aggressions on social networks on every local community's Facebook page. We developed a thematic matrix through an analysis of the most recurring meaning categories (framework method). We collected 217 texts (25 posts and 192 comments): 26% positive and 74% negative. Positive posts were shared about ten times more than negative ones. Negative comments received about double the "Likes" than the positive ones. Analysis highlighted three main meaning categories: 1. lack of adequate and functional structures; 2. negative point of view (POV) towards some departments; 3. positive POV towards others. No significant differences were observed between the various categories of healthcare workers (HCW). Geriatric, medical wards and emergency department were the most frequent targets of negative comments. All the texts referred to first-line operators except for one. Online violence against HCW is a real, largely unknown, problem that needs immediate and concrete attention for its potentially disastrous consequences. Compared to traditional face-to-face bullying, it can be more dangerous as it is contagious and diffusive, without spatial, temporal or personal boundaries.

TI  - A Fused Radar-Optical Approach for Mapping Wetlands and Deepwaters of the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast Regions of the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands are critically important ecosystems that provide ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, storm surge mitigation, water filtration, and wildlife habitat provision while supporting high levels of biodiversity. Despite their importance, monitoring these systems over large scales remains challenging due to difficulties in obtaining extensive up-to-date ground surveys and the need for high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery for effective space-borne monitoring. In this study, we developed methodologies to advance the monitoring of tidal marshes and adjacent deepwaters in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast United States. We combined Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 optical imagery to classify marshes and open water in both regions, with user's and producer's accuracies exceeding 89%. This methodology enables the assessment of marsh loss through conversion to open water at an annual resolution. We used time-series Sentinel-1 imagery to classify persistent and non-persistent marsh vegetation with greater than 93% accuracy. Non-persistent marsh vegetation serves as an indicator of salinity regimes in tidal wetlands. Additionally, we mapped two invasive species: wetlands invasive Phragmites australis (common reed) with greater than 80% accuracy and deepwater invasive Trapa natans (water chestnut) with greater than 96% accuracy. These results have important implications for improved monitoring and management of coastal wetlands ecosystems.

AB  - Tidal flat plays a crucial role in socio-economic development and ecological environment. Tidal flats in Ha Long-Cam Pha in Vietnam are impacted by human activities, especially coal mining activities. Using remote sensing data is able to detect, extract, and monitor the changes of tidal flats and exploited coal mine area with multi-temporal, in various scales, and for a large coverage. This study aims to investigate the impact of coal mining activities on the changes of tidal flats using remote sensing in Cam Pha, Ha Long, one of the biggest coal basins in Vietnam. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of tidal flats constructed by Landsat satellite images acquired in years 1989, 2001, and 2014 are compared to determine the volume changes. Besides, coal mining activities including coal production, waste rock dump area, and the expansion of open coal mine during the period 1989-2014 are investigated using correspondent Landsat images and the reports from the coal mine companies in the study area. Sediment samples in tidal flats are analyzed to determine the origin of the sediments. As the results, organic matter in the tidal flats is dominant with the concentration of 459 g/kg to 607 g/kg, which is evidence for the impact of coal exploitation on the coastal environment. In addition, the relationship between coal mine activities and tidal flat variation is well observed in this study.

TI  - Shoulder Dysfunction in Breast Cancer Survivors: Can Treatment Type or Musculoskeletal Factors Identify Those at Higher Risk?
T2  - REHABILITATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian women. Breast cancer survivors are known to experience shoulder dysfunction, but the influence of musculoskeletal and treatment factors has yet to be investigated in a Saskatchewan population, which was the purpose of this study. Methods: Two study designs were used to assess risk factors for dysfunction: (1) a cross-sectional Web-based questionnaire and (2) prospective cohort analysis of preoperative musculoskeletal assessment combined with postoperative Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) score. Data from the survey were summarized and analyzed using chi(2) tests (P < .05), while nonparametric measures were used to calculate temporal differences and associations between musculoskeletal risk factors and disability. Results: Commonly reported shoulder problems after treatment were stiffness (63.5%), restricted range of motion (61.9%), and changes in arm/hand sensation (61.9%). Axillary lymph node dissection and radiation therapy were associated with more shoulder problems than other treatment types. SPADI scores increased by an average of 8.1% from baseline to 3 months postsurgery. A clinically significant 18% increase between these time points was moderately associated with a history of shoulder problems and restricted humeral extension preoperatively (average = 37.7 degrees vs 48.9 degrees). Conclusions: Breast cancer survivors from Saskatchewan have a high prevalence of shoulder problems following treatment. Clinically significant impairments in shoulder function are associated with select treatment types and preoperative impairments. These results can be used to identify high-risk patients before cancer treatment and direct their rehabilitation.

TI  - Climatic Regulation of Vegetation Phenology in Protected Areas along Western South America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using 19 years of remotely sensed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), we examined the effects of climatic variability on terrestrial vegetation of six protected areas along southwestern South America, from the semiarid edge of the Atacama desert to southern Patagonia (30 degrees S-51 degrees S). The relationship between satellite phenology and climate indices, namely MEI (Multivariate ENSO Index), PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and SAM (Southern Annular Mode) were established using statistical analyses for non-stationary patterns. The annual mode of phenological activity fluctuated in strength through time from the semiarid region to the border of southern Patagonia. Concomitantly, enhanced synchrony between EVI and climatic oscillations appeared over interannual cycles. Cross correlations revealed that variability in MEI was the lead predictor of EVI fluctuations over scales shorter than 4 months at lower latitudes and for the most poleward study site. The PDO was correlated with EVI over lags longer than 4 months at low latitude sites, while the SAM showed relationships with EVI only for sites located around 40 degrees S. Our results indicate that the long-term phenological variability of the vegetation within protected areas along southwestern South America is controlled by processes linked to climate indices and that their influence varies latitudinally. Further studies over longer time scales will be needed to improve our understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation condition and its effect over phenological variability.

TI  - Satellite open data to monitor forest damage caused by extreme climate-induced events: a case study of the Vaia storm in Northern Italy
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of extreme storm events has significantly increased in the past decades, causing significant damage to European forests. To mitigate the impacts of extreme events, a rapid assessment of forest damage is crucial, and satellite data are an optimal candidate for this task. The integration of satellite data in the operational phase of monitoring forest damage can exploit the complementarity of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) open datasets from the Copernicus programme. This study illustrates the testing of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data for the detection of areas impacted by the Vaia storm in Northern Italy. The use of multispectral Sentinel 2 provided the best performance, with classification overall accuracy (OA) values up to 86 percent; however, optical data use is seriously hampered by cloud cover that can persist for months after the event and in most cases cannot be considered an appropriate tool if a fast response is required. The results obtained using SAR Sentinel 1 were slightly Less accurate (OA up to 68 percent), but the method was able to provide valuable information rapidly, mainly because the acquisition of this dataset is weather independent. Overall, for a fast assessment Sentinel 1 is the better of the two methods where multispectral and ground data are able to further refine the initial SAR-based assessment.

Metaphor is viewed from the perspective of cultural landscapes, a basic image schema. The study explores how metaphors create semantic "fields" in a given geographical space, providing signifying spaces within the corresponding cultural geographies. Additionally, the metaphor of the 'field' is used a basic text in scientific discourse, which sets the direction and the development of the scientific thought. Structural textual units in scientific discourse become loci-symbols with a binary nature: spatial as well as figurative and informative.

TI  - Mapping the Location and Extent of 2019 Prevent Planting Acres in South Dakota Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inability of a farmer to plant an insured crop by the policy's final planting date can pose financial challenges for the grower and cause reduced production for a widely impacted region. Prevented planting is primarily caused by excess moisture or rainfall such as the catastrophic flooding and widespread conditions that prevented active field work in the midwestern region of United States in 2019. While the Farm Service Agency reports the number of such "prevent plant" acres each year at the county scale, field-scale maps of prevent plant fields-which would enable analyses related to assessing and mitigating the impact of climate on agriculture-are not currently available. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a method for mapping likely prevent plant fields based on flood mapping and historical cropland maps. We focused on a study region in eastern South Dakota and created flood maps using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 images from 2018 and 2019. We used automatic threshold-based change detection using NDVI and NDWI to accentuate changes likely caused by flooding. The NDVI change detection map showed vegetation loss in the eastern parts of the study area while NDWI values showed increased water content, both indicating possible flooding events. The VH polarization of Sentinel 1 was also particularly useful in identifying potential flooded areas as the VH values for 2019 were substantially lower than those of 2018, especially in the northern part of the study area, likely indicating standing water or reduced biomass. We combined the flood maps from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 to form a complete flood likelihood map over the entire study area. We intersected this flood map with a map of fallow pixels extracted from the Cropland Data Layer to produce a map of predicted prevent plant acres across several counties in South Dakota. The predicted figures were within 10% error of Farm Service Agency reports, with low errors in the most affected counties in the state such as Beadle, Hanson, and Hand.

TI  - ON PROBABILITY OF SINGLE CULT COMPLEX OF ACHILLES IN LOWER BUH REGION IN ARCHAIC TIMES (BEREZAN - BEIKUSH - VELYKA CHORNOMORKA II)
T2  - EMINAK
M3  - Article
AB  - The discoveries at Cape Beikush allow us to significantly expand and refine our understanding of the nature and extent of local influence on the archaic cult of Achilles in the Northern Black Sea region. The decisive factor in the formation of the archaic cult of Achilles in the Northern Black Sea region at the initial stage was the meeting of the colonists with a powerful ideological phenomenon - the veneration of the local tribes (relic Aryans) almost continuously, since the IV millennium BCE, AXI-the Serpent - the first Ancestor and personification of the Indo-European worldview born in the Northern Black Sea region.The earliest archaeological evidence of the Achilles worship in the Northern Black Sea region dates from the end of the VII - early VI centuries BC and is associated with a cult complex of Achilles in the Lower Buh region (`Lower Pobuzhzhia'), combining Berezan', Beikush and Velyka Chornomorka II. This allows us to distinguish a special and earliest stage in the development of the cult of Achilles in the Northern Black Sea region: the end of the VII - early V centuries BCE, when the sanctuary of Achilles on Beikush ceased to exist. After that, in other places of Achilles' worship in the Northern Black Sea region, the << Serpent >> features of the cult of Achilles on Beikush were no longer repeated. In other words, the image and cult of Achilles was no longer associated with serpents. This indicates a gradual loss of syncretism of these images and cults due to the decline of local, << barbaric >> influence on them after the 5th century BCE.This is also due to the fact that AXI-the << Serpent-ancestor >> was for the Greek colonists, obviously, an alien deity. The subsequent transfer of the center of the veneration of Achilles to the Island of Levke seems to be the realization of the need to bring the cult important for further colonization (to completely abandon the cult of AXI-the Serpent - the << master >> of the Northern Black Sea Region to the colonists, surrounded by << barbarians >>, was clearly unprofitable) in accordance with the already existing legends about the White Island and Homer's Achilles, as well as with the << norms >> of the Delphic oracle, which clearly did not meet the << barbarian >> Beikush. The appearance in Roman times of the cult of Achilles Pontarchus - the << Lord of the Black Sea >> and God cannot be explained by anything other than the great importance of the prototype of Achilles in the Northern Black Sea region in previous times, from the beginning of the formation of the Indo-European community.

AB  - Coal is one of the most mining commodities to date, especially to supply both national and international energy needs. Coal mining activities that are not well managed will have an impact on the occurrence of environmental damage. The present study was undertaken to analyze the process of human induced landscape transformation in the coal mines affected areas of Cam Pha, northeast Vietnam by interpreting temporal remote sensing data and using Geographic Information System. This experiment revealed that most of the study area was dominated by forest in all the time sequence period. The forest cover has decreased about 21.3%, meanwhile having nine fold increase in mining area from 1990 to 2020. The forest area lost during the study period was 7983.45 ha due to land cover conversion into mining area. The mining activities were also detrimental to the bare land and water body cover. The results of this study are expected to be used to support government efforts and mining managers in post-mining coal activities.

TI  - Velocity Anomaly of Campbell Glacier, East Antarctica, Observed by Double-Differential Interferometric SAR and Ice Penetrating Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional changes in the flow velocity of Antarctic glaciers can affect the ice sheet mass balance and formation of surface crevasses. The velocity anomaly of a glacier can be detected using the Double-Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DDInSAR) technique that removes the constant displacement in two Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) images at different times and shows only the temporally variable displacement. In this study, two circular-shaped ice-velocity anomalies in Campbell Glacier, East Antarctica, were analyzed by using 13 DDInSAR images generated from COSMO-SkyMED one-day tandem DInSAR images in 2010-2011. The topography of the ice surface and ice bed were obtained from the helicopter-borne Ice Penetrating Radar (IPR) surveys in 2016-2017. Denoted as A and B, the velocity anomalies were in circular shapes with radii of similar to 800 m, located 14.7 km (A) and 11.3 km (B) upstream from the grounding line of the Campbell Glacier. Velocity anomalies were up to similar to 1 cm/day for A and similar to 5 cm/day for B. To investigate the cause of the two velocity anomalies, the ice surface and bed profiles derived from the IPR survey crossing the anomalies were analyzed. The two anomalies lay over a bed hill along the glacial valley where stick-slip and pressure melting can occur, resulting in temporal variation of ice velocity. The bright radar reflection and flat hydraulic head at the ice bed of A observed in the IPR-derived radargram strongly suggested the existence of basal water in a form of reservoir or film, which caused smaller friction and the reduced variation of stick-slip motion compared to B. Crevasses began to appear at B due to tensile stress at the top of the hill and the fast flow downstream. The sporadic shift of the location of anomalies suggests complex pressure melting and transportation of the basal water over the bed hill.

M3  - Review
AB  - In 2020 series, we summarized the major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology with providing representative figures of the most influential study for 1 of each 3 gynecologic cancers: cervix, ovary, and uterine corpus. Review for cervical cancer covered targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, adjuvant radiation therapy or concurrent/sequential chemoradiation therapy after radical hysterectomy in early cervical cancer, radical surgery in early cervical cancer; and prevention and screening. Ovarian cancer research included studies of various combinations of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and/or vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors according to the clinical setting. For uterine corpus cancer, molecular classification upon which the decision of adjuvant treatments might be based, World Health Organization recommendation of 2-tier grading system (low grade vs. high grade), sentinel lymph node assessment and ovarian preservation in clinically early-stage endometrial cancer were reviewed. Molecular targeted agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors which showed promising anti-tumor activities in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer were also included in this review.

TI  - Land-use and land-cover change in the lowlands of Bale Zone, Ethiopia: its driving factors and impacts of rangeland dynamics in livestock mobility
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland in Bale lowlands has been seriously degraded due to human-induced problems and natural factors. The study was conducted to analyze LULC change and its deriving factors and evaluate the impacts of rangeland dynamics on livestock mobility in Bale lowlands from 1990-2020. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 1990, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) 2000, and Operational Land Imager (OLI) 2014 and 2020 were chosen to derive LULC classes using maximum likelihood image classifier. Besides, a household survey was used to understand the major causes of LULC change, as well as the impacts of rangeland dynamics on livestock mobility. The accuracy reports of classified LULC classes of the study were 88.2% (1990), 89.19% (2000), 93.8% (2014), and 95.2% (2020). The result of the study revealed that there was extreme bush encroachment (545.54%), expansion of settlement (19,166%), and farmland (171.27%) while forest cover has slightly decreased (-8.76%) from 1990 to 2020. On the other hand, shrubland (-72.74%) and grassland (-59.2%) have extremely declined. During the study period, rangeland of Bale lowlands was degraded with annual rate of -0.8%. The study also revealed that expansion of farmland, settlement, communal land, and bush encroachment was the main driving factors for LULC change in Bale lowlands. Bale pastoralists are vulnerable to the death of their livestock, and they need to travel long distances because of rapid rangeland degradation. Therefore, suitable land-use and management policies for pastoral communities should be formulated and implemented so as to permanently mitigate the problem.

TI  - Worldview-motivated rejection of science and the norms of science
T2  - COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Some scientific propositions are so well established that they are no longer debated by the relevant scientific community, such as the fact that greenhouse gas emissions are altering the Earth's climate. In many cases, such scientifically settled issues are nonetheless rejected by segments of the public. U.S. surveys have repeatedly shown that the rejection of scientific evidence across a broad range of domains is preferentially associated with rightwing or libertarian worldviews, with little evidence for rejection of scientific evidence by people on the political left. We report two preregistered representative surveys (each N > 1000) that (1) sought to explain this apparent political asymmetry and (2) continued the search for the rejection of scientific evidence on the political left. To address the first question, we focused on Merton's classic analysis of the norms of science, such as communism and universalism, which continue to be internalized by the scientific community but which are not readily reconciled with conservative values. Both studies show that people's political worldviews are associated with their attitudes towards those scientific norms, and that those attitudes predict people's acceptance of vaccinations and climate science. The norms of science may thus be in latent conflict with the worldviews of a substantial segment of the public. To address the second question, we examined people's views on the role of inheritance in determining people's intelligence, given that the belief in the power of learning and environmental factors to shape human development is a guiding principle of leftwing thought. We find no association between core measures of political worldviews and people's view of heritability of intelligence, although two subordinate constructs, nationalism and social dominance orientation, were associated with belief in heritability.

TI  - Coseismic deformation characteristics of the 2020 Nima, Xizang <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>6.3 earthquake from Sentinel-1A/B InSAR data and rupture slip distribution
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake with M(w)6.3 occurred in Nima, Xizang on 22 July 2020 (Coordinated Universal Time, UTC). To accurately determine its location, invert the rupture slip distribution and evaluate the seismic hazards, in this paper, differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) technology was used to process the Sentinel-1A/B SAR data and obtain line of sight coseismic deformation field. The deformation field was mainly subsidence, which is in the NE direction, and the maximum subsidence of ascending and descending track was similar to 30 cm and similar to 26 cm, respectively. Then, the location and geometric parameters of the seismic fault were retrieved by using Bayesian methods (BM) based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling. On the basis, the seismic rupture slip distribution was obtained by Steepest Descent Methods (SDM). The inversion showed that the strike of similar to 30.41 degrees +/- 1.25 degrees, the dip angle of similar to 49.52 degrees +/- 1.06 degrees and it belongs to the East-dipping fault. The epicenter location was (86.89 degrees E, 33.18 degrees N) and located at the depth of 7.23 km. Only one slip center was concentrated at the depth of 3.4 similar to 11.8 km, and the maximum slip of similar to 0.98 m. The average rake angle of -74.54 degrees, indicated that this earthquake was dominated by normal fault with minor left-lateral strike-slip. The seismic moment was similar to 3.86 x 10(18) N.m (M(W)6.36), which was slightly larger than the results published by the USGS (United States Geological Survey). For the region with a depth of 5 km and 10 km located in the north and south end of the rupture zone, and the region with a depth of 15 km and 20 km located in the east and west sides of the rupture zone, the Coulomb failure stress change >= 0.01 MPa, so the future risk deserves more attention.

TI  - River Extraction under Bankfull Discharge Conditions Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery and DEM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge and width, as essential hydraulic variables and hydrological data, play a vital role in influencing the water cycle, driving the resulting river topography and supporting ecological functioning. Insights into bankfull river discharge and bankfull width at fine spatial resolutions are essential. In this study, 10-m Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data, as well as in situ discharge and sediment data, are fused to extract bankfull river widths on the upper Yellow River. Using in situ cross-section morphology data and flood frequency estimations to calculate the bankfull discharge of 22 hydrological stations, the one-to-one correspondence relationship between the bankfull discharge data and the image cover data was determined. The machine learning (ML) method is used to extract water bodies from the Sentinel-2 images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The mean overall accuracy was above 0.87, and the mean kappa value was above 0.75. The research results show that (1) for rivers with high suspended sediment concentrations, the water quality index (SRMIR-Red) constitutes a higher contribution; the infrared band performs better in areas with greater amounts of vegetation coverage; and for rivers in general, the water indices perform best. (2) The effective river width of the extracted connected rivers is 30 m, which is 3 times the image resolution. The R-2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE) of the estimated river width values are 0.991, 7.455 m, and -0.232 m, respectively. (3) The average river widths of the single-thread sections show linear increases along the main stream, and the R-2 value is 0.801. The river width has a power function relationship with bankfull discharge and the contributing area, i.e., the downstream hydraulic geometry, with R-2 values of 0.782 and 0.630, respectively. More importantly, the extracted river widths provide basic data to analyze the spatial distribution of bankfull widths along river networks and other applications in hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and stream ecology.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology is an important means of ocean exploration. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely used in small observation areas because of its flexible operation, timely data transmission, and high spatial resolution. According to these characteristics, we propose a ship attribute inversion algorithm based on the wake characteristics. First, a band selection method is used to reduce the data dimensionality and remove redundant information from UAV remote sensing data. Then, the ship wake is detected by extracting the shear wave (S-wave) characteristics. Finally, the ship's motion parameters are inverted according to the S-wave attributes. The experimental results show that the method proposed can detect the wakes effectively and estimate ship velocity accurately using the UAV-obtained hyperspectral images.

TI  - Early Identifying and Monitoring Landslides in Guizhou Province with InSAR and Optical Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The topography and landforms of Guizhou Province in China are complicated, and the climatic conditions of heavy precipitation make landslide disasters in Guizhou Province occur frequently. To avoid damage to people's lives and economic property caused by disasters, a reliable early landslide identification method and landslide monitoring method are urgently needed. Traditional landslide identification and monitoring methods have limitations. InSAR technology has unique advantages in large-scale landslide identification and monitoring, but landslide identification results based on a single deformation value are one-sided. Therefore, this paper uses Sentinel-1A radar satellite image data and uses InSAR technology and optical remote sensing technology to carry out large-scale surface deformation monitoring and identification of dangerous deformation areas in Liupanshui City, Tongren City, Guiyang City and other regions in Guizhou Province. The potential landslide identification methods based on the time series normalized difference vegetation index and landslide development environment elements are combined to investigate hidden landslide hazards in the study area. In this paper, time series InSAR technology is used to monitor three key landslides in Jichang Town, Yujiaying and Fana, to grasp the movement status of the landslide in time. The method of landslide identification and monitoring in this paper is of great significance for disaster prevention and management in Guizhou Province.

TI  - Optimal Solar Zenith Angle Definition for Combined Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/2B Data Angular Normalization Using Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/2B are often combined for terrestrial monitoring because of their similar spectral bands. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect has been observed in both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/2B reflectance data. However, there is currently no definition of solar zenith angle (theta(sz)) that is suitable for the normalization of the BRDF-adjusted reflectance from the three sensors' combined data. This paper describes the use of four machine learning (ML) models to predict a global theta(sz) that is suitable for the normalization of bidirectional reflectance from the combined data in 2018. The observed theta(sz) collected globally, and the three locations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (26.622 degrees E, 0.356 degrees N), Texas in the USA (99.406 degrees W 30.751 degrees N), and Finland (25.194 degrees E, 61.653 degrees N), are chosen to compare the performance of the ML models. At a global scale, the ML models of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) exhibit comparably good performance to that of polynomial regression, considering center latitude as the input to predict the global theta(sz). GPR achieves the best overall performance considering the center latitude and acquisition time as inputs, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.390 degrees, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.689 degrees, and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.994. SVR shows an RMSE of 1.396 degrees, an MAE of 0.638 degrees, and an R-2 of 0.994, following GPR. For a specific location, the SVR and GPR models have higher accuracy than the polynomial regression, with GPR exhibiting the best performance, when center latitude and acquisition time are considered as inputs. GPR is recommended for predicting the global theta(sz) using the three sensors' combined data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal evolution of an impervious surface (IS) is significant for urban planning. In this paper, the IS was extracted and its spatiotemporal evolution for the Chengdu urban area was analyzed based on Landsat imagery. Our experimental results indicated that convolutional neural networks achieved the better performance with an overall accuracy of 98.32%, Kappa coefficient of 0.98, and Macro F1 of 98.28%, and the farmland was replaced by IS from 2001 to 2017, and the IS area (ISA) increased by 51.24 km(2); that is, the growth rate was up to 13.8% in sixteen years. According to the landscape metrics, the IS expanded and agglomerated into large patches from small fragmented ones. In addition, the gross domestic product change of the secondary industry was similar to the change of ISA between 2001 and 2017. Thus, the spatiotemporal evolution of IS was associated with the economic development of the Chengdu urban area in the past sixteen years.

TI  - Retrieving Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence from Hyperspectral Data with TanSat Satellite
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of algorithms for satellite retrievals of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have been developed and applied to different sensors. However, research on SIF retrieval using hyperspectral data is performed in narrow spectral windows, assuming that SIF remains constant. In this paper, based on the singular vector decomposition (SVD) technique, we present an approach for retrieving SIF, which can be applied to remotely sensed data with ultra-high spectral resolution and in a broad spectral window without assuming that the SIF remains constant. The idea is to combine the first singular vector, the pivotal information of the non-fluorescence spectrum, with the low-frequency contribution of the atmosphere, plus a linear combination of the remaining singular vectors to express the non-fluorescence spectrum. Subject to instrument settings, the retrieval was performed within a spectral window of approximately 7 nm that contained only Fraunhofer lines. In our retrieval, hyperspectral data of the O-2-A band from the first Chinese carbon dioxide observation satellite (TanSat) was used. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was introduced to self-adaptively determine the number of free parameters and reduce retrieval noise. SIF retrievals were compared with TanSat SIF and OCO-2 SIF. The results showed good consistency and rationality. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to verify the performance of this approach. To summarize, the approach would provide more possibilities for retrieving SIF from hyperspectral data.

TI  - Monitoring Changes in the Transparency of the Largest Reservoir in Eastern China in the Past Decade, 2013-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on characteristics analysis about remote sensing reflectance, the Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) in the Qiandao Lake was predicted from the Landsat8/OLI data, and its changing rates on a pixel-by-pixel scale were obtained from satellite remote sensing for the first time. Using 114 matchups data pairs during 2013-2019, the SDD satellite algorithms suitable for the Qiandao Lake were obtained through both the linear regression and machine learning (Support Vector Machine) methods, with remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at different OLI bands and the ratio of Rrs (Band3) to Rrs (Band2) as model input parameters. Compared with field observations, the mean absolute relative difference and root mean squared error of satellite-derived SDD were within 20% and 1.3 m, respectively. Satellite-derived results revealed that SDD in the Qiandao Lake was high in boreal spring and winter, and reached the lowest in boreal summer, with the annual mean value of about 5 m. Spatially, high SDD was mainly concentrated in the southeast lake area (up to 13 m) close to the dam. The edge and runoff area of the lake were less transparent, with an SDD of less than 4 m. In the past decade (2013-2020), 5.32% of Qiandao Lake witnessed significant (p < 0.05) transparency change: 4.42% raised with a rate of about 0.11 m/year and 0.9% varied with a rate of about -0.09 m/year. Besides, the findings presented here suggested that heavy rainfall would have a continuous impact on the Qiandao Lake SDD. Our research could promote the applications of land observation satellites (such as the Landsat series) in water environment monitoring in inland reservoirs.

TI  - Mapping the Growing Stem Volume of the Coniferous Plantations in North China Using Multispectral Data from Integrated GF-2 and Sentinel-2 Images and an Optimized Feature Variable Selection Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurement of forest growing stem volume (GSV) is important for forest resource management and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Optical remote sensing imagery has great application prospects in forest GSV estimation on regional and global scales as it is easily accessible, has a wide coverage, and mature technology. However, their application is limited by cloud coverage, data stripes, atmospheric effects, and satellite sensor errors. Combining multi-sensor data can reduce such limitations as it increases the data availability, but also causes the multi-dimensional problem that increases the difficulty of feature selection. In this study, GaoFen-2 (GF-2) and Sentinel-2 images were integrated, and feature variables and data scenarios were derived by a proposed adaptive feature variable combination optimization (AFCO) program for estimating the GSV of coniferous plantations. The AFCO algorithm was compared to four traditional feature variable selection methods, namely, random forest (RF), stepwise random forest (SRF), fast iterative feature selection method for k-nearest neighbors (KNN-FIFS), and the feature variable screening and combination optimization procedure based on the distance correlation coefficient and k-nearest neighbors (DC-FSCK). The comparison indicated that the AFCO program not only considered the combination effect of feature variables, but also optimized the selection of the first feature variable, error threshold, and selection of the estimation model. Furthermore, we selected feature variables from three datasets (GF-2, Sentinel-2, and the integrated data) following the AFCO and four other feature selection methods and used the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and random forest regression (RFR) to estimate the GSV of coniferous plantations in northern China. The results indicated that the integrated data improved the GSV estimation accuracy of coniferous plantations, with relative root mean square errors (RMSErs) of 15.0% and 19.6%, which were lower than those of GF-2 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. In particular, the texture feature variables derived from GF-2 red band image have a significant impact on GSV estimation performance of the integrated dataset. For most data scenarios, the AFCO algorithm gained more accurate GSV estimates, as the RMSErs were 30.0%, 23.7%, 17.7%, and 17.5% lower than those of RF, SRF, KNN-FIFS, and DC-FSCK, respectively. The GSV distribution map obtained by the AFCO method and RFR model matched the field observations well. This study provides some insight into the application of optical images, optimization of the feature variable combination, and modeling algorithm selection for estimating the GSV of coniferous plantations.

TI  - Lake water storage change estimation and its linkage with terrestrial water storage change in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tibetan Plateau (TP) lakes are important water resources, which are experiencing quick expansion in recent decades. Previous researches mainly focus on analyzing the relationship between terrestrial water storage (TWS) change and lake water storage (LWS) change in the total inner TP, it is still lack of researches about the spatial difference and the characteristic of sub-region in the inner TP. In this study, we estimated the area change of 34 lakes by using Landsat images in the northeastern TP during 1976-2013, and LWS change by using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The results suggested that LWS had shrunk from 1976 to 1994, and then expanded quickly until 2013. LWS had a serious decrease by 13.6 Gt during 1976-1994, and then it increased quickly by 35.4 Gt during 1994-2013. We estimated TWS change, soil moisture change, and permafrost degradation based on the satellite data and related models during 2003-2013. The results indicated that their changing rates were 1.86 Gt/y, 0.22 Gt/y, and -0.19 Gt/y, respectively. We also calculated the change of groundwater based on the mass balance with a decreasing trend of -0.054 Gt/y. The results suggested that the cause of TWS change was the increase of LWS. We analyzed the cause of lake change according to water balance, and found that the primary cause of lake expansion was the increasing precipitation (80.7%), followed by glacier meltwater (10.3%) and permafrost degradation (9%). The spatial difference between LWS change and TWS change should be studied further, which is important to understand the driving mechanism of water resources change.

TI  - Retrieving Surface Soil Moisture over Wheat-Covered Areas Using Data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a major factor that affects crop growth. Combined microwave and optical data have been widely used to improve the accuracy of SSM retrievals. However, the influence of vegetation indices derived from the red-edge spectral bands of multi-spectral optical data on retrieval accuracy has not been sufficiently analyzed. In this study, we retrieved soil moisture from wheat-covered surfaces using Sentinel-1/2 data. First, a modified water cloud model (WCM) was proposed to remove the influence of vegetation from the backscattering coefficient of the radar data. The vegetation fraction (FV) was then introduced in this WCM, and the vegetation water content (VWC) was calculated using a multiple linear regression model. Subsequently, the support vector regression technique was used to retrieve the SSM. This approach was validated using in situ measurements of wheat fields in Hebi, located in northern Henan Province, China. The key findings of this study are: (1) Based on vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 data, the proposed VWC estimation model effectively eliminated the influence of vegetation; (2) Compared with vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) polarization, vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarization was better for detecting changes in SSM key phenological phases of wheat; (3) The validated model indicates that the proposed approach successfully retrieved SSM in the study area using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Meta-FSEO: A Meta-Learning Fast Adaptation with Self-Supervised Embedding Optimization for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of deep learning is heavily influenced by the size of the learning samples, whose labeling process is time consuming and laborious. Deep learning algorithms typically assume that the training and prediction data are independent and uniformly distributed, which is rarely the case given the attributes and properties of different data sources. In remote sensing images, representations of urban land surfaces can vary across regions and by season, demanding rapid generalization of these surfaces in remote sensing data. In this study, we propose Meta-FSEO, a novel model for improving the performance of few-shot remote sensing scene classification in varying urban scenes. The proposed Meta-FSEO model deploys self-supervised embedding optimization for adaptive generalization in new tasks such as classifying features in new urban regions that have never been encountered during the training phase, thus balancing the requirements for feature classification tasks between multiple images collected at different times and places. We also created a loss function by weighting the contrast losses and cross-entropy losses. The proposed Meta-FSEO demonstrates a great generalization capability in remote sensing scene classification among different cities. In a five-way one-shot classification experiment with the Sentinel-1/2 Multi-Spectral (SEN12MS) dataset, the accuracy reached 63.08%. In a five-way five-shot experiment on the same dataset, the accuracy reached 74.29%. These results indicated that the proposed Meta-FSEO model outperformed both the transfer learning-based algorithm and two popular meta-learning-based methods, i.e., MAML and Meta-SGD.

TI  - A Novel Microfacet Cosine Linear Kernel-Driven Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The algorithm of a four-parameter (isotropic, mixed cosine, normal zenith cosine square, and incident cosine square) microfacet cosine linear kernel-driven (MICOKE) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model is introduced. The MICOKE model was built from bidirectional reflectance factor data from a portable surface reflectance measurement system at sample points (5-km spacing) at the Dunhuang site(longitude: 94.26x00B0;94.38x00B0;, latitude: 40.09x00B0;40.18x00B0;) in 2013. Traditional observation geometries were converted to microfacet observation geometries. Possible candidate models in multivariate power series form were tested and compared by the square of the correlation coefficients (SCCs) and the standard deviations (STDs). A model with a large SCC and small STD was selected as the MICOKE model. Using the Dunhuang site field campaign observation data, the mean of the SCCs of MICOKE was 4.73x0025; higher than that of the Rossx2013;Li BRDF model over 350x2013;2500 nm for small observation geometries (SMGs). Using the Dunhuang site FY-2G/VISSR data, the SCCs of MICOKE were above 0.957 for large observation geometries (LAGs). In comparison, the SCCs of Rossx2013;Li were only 0.020 (small field) and 0.357 (full field). The MICOKE model was compared with the Rossx2013;Li model by the use of MCD43C1 and MCD12C1 products for 16 cover types. The SCCs varied from 0.930 to 1.000. The MICOKE BRDF model greatly improves the accuracy of the Gobi cover type for LAG and can be widely used in remote sensing.

TI  - Partial Coupling and Earthquake Potential Along the Xianshuihe Fault, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The left-lateral Xianshuihe Fault is located at the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau and is one of the most active faults in China. It is associated with substantial seismic potential, with more than 20 Mw > 6 earthquakes since 1700. The fault has been documented to be creeping at the surface for decades; however, the spatial and temporal distributions of shallow creep along the fault are not well resolved. In this study, we obtain high-resolution interseismic velocity maps along the 350-km-long central Xianshuihe Fault and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series along the Kangding segment using ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data. The InSAR data reveal multiple creeping sections and the estimated surface creep rates show high along-strike variability. A coupling model characterizes the distribution of creep with depth. The seismic potential of apparent rupture asperities along the Xianshuihe Fault is further refined by considering fault-crossing baseline data and the distribution of historical ruptures and microseismicity. Moreover, a stress-driven afterslip model of the observed accelerated creep around the Mw 5.9 2014 Kangding rupture indicates substantial shallow afterslip, which provides further constraints on the distribution of locked and creeping patches along this section of the Xianshuihe Fault.

TI  - Characteristics of aerosol optical depth dynamics and their causes over typical cities along the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols, i. e., suspension of liquid and/or solid particles in air, have serious impacts on human health. Exploring the variation and patterns of regional atmospheric aerosols is of great significance to monitor and evaluate atmosphere quality, especially in urban areas with large population. Here, with nine typical pivotal cities along the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road through Southeast Asia, South Asia to West Asia as case studies, based on MCD19A2 550 nm AOD products, combined meteorological factors, land use data, and nighttime light data, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution, variation features, influencing and/or driving factors of aerosols in developed urban areas over Asia. The results showed that the descending sequence of the annual aerosol optical depth ( AOD) of the nine cities was Karachi, Doha, Chittagong, Bangkok, Colombo, Ho Chi Minh, Singapore, Gwadar, and Yangon during 2013-2018. Due to the influence of regional climate system and atmospheric aerosol types, the time series of annual, seasonal, and monthly AODs were significantly different. The high values of AODs in most cities were mainly located in the urban center or rapid socio-economic (e. g., industrial and agricultural) development regions. The effects of different meteorological factors on the AODs varied in different cities. The rainfall, relative humidity, and wind speed had great impacts on AODs in Ho Chi Minh, Bangkok, Singapore, and Yangon. Temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed had close correlations with AODs in Chittagong, Colombo, Karachi, and Gwadar of South Asia and Doha in West Asia. The urban area' s AOD was influenced by the combined and synergistic effects of socio-economy, urbanization, and meteorological factors, with that in Karachi being the most significant.

TI  - The Processing Framework and Experimental Verification for the Noninterrupted Synchronization Scheme of LuTan-1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) plays an important role in remote sensing. However, the deviation between the two oscillators in BiSAR systems will cause a residual modulation of the echo signal. Therefore, the phase synchronization is an important issue that must be addressed in the BiSAR system. An advanced noninterrupted phase synchronization scheme is used for LuTan-1. The synchronization pulses are exchanged immediately after the ending time of the radar echo receiving window and before the starting time of the next pulse repetition interval, which will not interrupt the normal SAR operation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the phase synchronization scheme, the model of phase synchronization is introduced at first. The hardware design and processing flow of LuTan-1 are introduced in detail. An innovative internal calibration strategy is also described. Then, the test data acquired by the ground validation system are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the phase synchronization scheme. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the synchronization rate are the two most important factors to influence the accuracy in phase synchronization. The conclusions have guiding significance for the synchronization module design of LuTan-1 and the future BiSAR system.

TI  - Predictive and Prognostic Value of BRAF and NRAS Mutation of 159 Sentinel Lymph Node Cases in Melanoma-A Retrospective Single-Institute Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess the prognostic role of sentinel lymph node status (SLN) in melanoma patients, a statistical comparison was performed with the application of already known prognostic factors, mutational occurrence of BRAF and NRAS in the primary tumor, as well as disease outcome. Methods: Our retrospective single-center study involved 159 melanoma cases, who underwent SLN biopsy. The following clinico-pathological data were collected: age, gender, location of primary tumor, Breslow thickness, ulceration degree, histological subtype, mitosis count, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, regression signs, mutations of BRAF and NRAS of the primary tumors, and SLN status. Results: From the studied clinico-pathological factors, only Breslow thickness increased the risk of SLN positivity (p = 0.025) by multivariate analysis, while neither BRAF nor NRAS mutation of the primary tumor proved to be a predictor of the SLN status. While the NRAS-mutant subgroup showed the most unfavorable outcome for progression-free and distant metastasis-free survival, their rate of positive SLNs proved to be relatively lower than that of patient groups with BRAF mutation and double-wild-type phenotypes. Conclusion: Similarly to the importance of SLN positivity, NRAS mutation of the primary tumor proved to be an independent prognostic factor of progression. Therefore, despite negative SLN, this NRAS-mutant subgroup of patients still requires closer monitoring to detect disease progression.

TI  - Fine-Resolution Mapping of Pan-Arctic Lake Ice-Off Phenology Based on Dense Sentinel-2 Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of lake ice-off regulates biotic and abiotic processes in Arctic ecosystems. Due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of available satellite data, previous studies mainly focused on lake-scale investigations of melting/freezing, hindering the detection of subtle patterns within heterogeneous landscapes. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a new approach for fine-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic lake ice-off phenology. Using the Scene Classification Layer data derived from dense Sentinel-2 time series images, we estimated the pixel-by-pixel ice break-up end date information by seeking the transition time point when the pixel is completely free of ice. Applying this approach on the Google Earth Engine platform, we mapped the spatial distribution of the break-up end date for 45,532 lakes across the entire Arctic (except for Greenland) for the year 2019. The evaluation results suggested that our estimations matched well with both in situ measurements and an existing lake ice phenology product. Based on the generated map, we estimated that the average break-up end time of Pan-Arctic lakes is 172 +/- 13.4 (measured in day of year) for the year 2019. The mapped lake ice-off phenology exhibits a latitudinal gradient, with a linear slope of 1.02 days per degree from 55 degrees N onward. We also demonstrated the importance of lake and landscape characteristics in affecting spring lake ice melting. The proposed approach offers new possibilities for monitoring the seasonal Arctic lake ice freeze-thaw cycle, benefiting the ongoing efforts of combating and adapting to climate change.

TI  - Process-oriented estimation of column-integrated algal biomass in eutrophic lakes by MODIS/Aqua
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms happen widely in eutrophic lakes. The satellite-derived surface algal bloom area and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration are commonly used as indicators to judge the water quality. However, vertical migration of phytoplankton may seriously affect the assessment accuracy of water quality with the surface status as an indicator. In fact, the water column-integrated algal biomass is better for describing the water quality. To remotely estimate the algal biomass considering the vertical Chl-a profile (uniform or otherwise), this paper proposed a novel process-oriented algorithm applied successfully in Lake Chaohu, China. First, we built a decision tree to identify the pixel-based Chl-a profile types using the floating algae index, surface Chl-a concentration, and wind speed. Then, the nonuniform profile was expressed as a power decay function (Chl-a(z) = n1 ? zn2) and parameterized using the surface Chl-a concentration. Finally, the algal biomass was derived from MODIS/Aqua satellite data. The estimation results were acceptable and the bias was -19.95%. The monthly mean algal biomass varied significantly and exhibited two peaks in spring and summer. The annual mean algal biomass increased from 2003 to 2010 (Pearson r = 0.82; p < 0.05) and then decreased from 2012 to 2018 (r = -0.71; p = 0.07). Monthly variations were determined by the air temperature (77.09%), but annual variations were primarily influenced by ammonia nitrogen level (44.61%). With known algal biomass and wind speed, the pixelbased algal bloom probability could be forecasted. The developed process-oriented algorithm was also applicable to eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. This study is of great significance for scientifically assessing water quality and effectively managing aquatic environmental disasters.

TI  - Effects of rotation grazing time on the characteristics of soil seed bank in desert steppe
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the characteristics of soil seed bank under seasonal grazing plays an important role in the reasonable use of desert steppe. We examined seed bank species composition, density, vertical distribution, diversity in the soil of 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 cm soil layers and the relationship with vegetation and soil environmental factors in Ningxia desert steppe. The treatments included enclosure (FY), traditional time rotation grazing (FG), delayed to start rotation grazing (YG), early to end rotation grazing (TG), delayed to start and early to end rotation grazing (YT) and free grazing (ZY). The results showed that there were nine families and 21 species in the soil seed bank in the study area. The species composition of soil seed bank in TG seed bank with 13 species was the largest, while FY and ZY soil seed banks had the least, with 8 species, respectively. The density of ZY soil seed bank was significantly higher than that of FY, YG, TG and YT. The number of perennial species seeds in the soil seed bank of FY was the largest, reaching 32.0%, while that in the ZY was the least, only 12.4%, mainly with sexually reproduced annual weeds. Soil seed bank was mainly concentrated in the 0-5 cm surface layer. With increasing soil depth, the size of soil seed bank decreased. The dominance and diversity of soil seed bank were the highest in FY, while the dominance, diversity and uniformity were the lowest in ZY. The similarity between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation was generally low. In contrast, the FG and ZY seed banks had higher similarity with vegetation, and the FY was the lowest. Soil moisture, organic matter, total nitrogen concentration, total phosphorus concentration, and soil bulk density were the main soil factors affecting soil seed bank. Compared with traditional whole year free grazing, seasonal four-zone rotation grazing could increase species richness and abundance of perennial plants in soil seed bank of desert steppe, as well as the total species richness, diversity and uniformity of the seed bank. Although the effect sof seasonal four-zone rotation grazing on seed bank was not as good as the long-term enclosure grassland, it was of great significance to the utilization and protection of desert steppe.

TI  - Sensitivity of Spectral Indices on Burned Area Detection using Landsat Time Series in Savannas of Southern Burkina Faso
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient burned area mapping and monitoring are fundamental for environmental applications. Studies using Landsat time series for burned area mapping are increasing and popular. However, the performance of burned area mapping with different spectral indices and Landsat time series has not been evaluated and compared. This study compares eleven spectral indices for burned area detection in the savanna area of southern Burkina Faso using Landsat data ranging from October 2000 to April 2016. The same reference data are adopted to assess the performance of different spectral indices. The results indicate that Burned Area Index (BAI) is the most accurate index in burned area detection using our method based on harmonic model fitting and breakpoint identification. Among those tested, fire-related indices are more accurate than vegetation indices, and Char Soil Index (CSI) performed worst. Furthermore, we evaluate whether combining several different spectral indices can improve the accuracy of burned area detection. According to the results, only minor improvements in accuracy can be attained in the studied environment, and the performance depended on the number of selected spectral indices.

TI  - Impact of assimilating FY-3C MWHS2 data in the RMAPS-ST forecast system on its rainfall forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to evaluate the impact of assimilating FY-3C satellite Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS2) data on rainfall forecasts in the new-generation Rapid-refresh Multi-scale Analysis and Prediction System-Short Term (RMAPS-ST) operational system, which is developed by the Institute of Urban Meteorology of the China Meteorological Administration, four experiments were carried out in this study: (i) Coldstart (no observations assimilated); (H) CON (assimilation of conventional observations); (iii) FY3 (assimilation of FY-3C MWHS2 only); and (iv) FY3+CON (simultaneous assimilation of FY-3C MWHS2 and conventional observations). A precipitation process that took place in central-eastern China during 4-6 June 2019 was selected as a case study. When the authors assimilated the FY-3C MWHS2 data in the RMAPS-ST operational system, data quality control and bias correction were performed so that the O-B (observation minus background) values of the five humidity channels of MWHS2 became closer to a normal distribution, and the data basically satisfied the unbiased assumption. The results showed that, in this case, the predictions of both precipitation location and intensity were improved in the FY3+CON experiment compared with the other three experiments. Meanwhile, the prediction of atmospheric parameters for the mesoscale field was also improved, and the RMSE of the specific humidity forecast at the 850-400 hPa height was reduced. This study implies that FY-3C MWHS2 data can be successfully assimilated in a regional numerical model and has the potential to improve the forecasting of rainfall.

TI  - Mapping 30 m Fractional Forest Cover over China's Three-North Region from Landsat-8 Data Using Ensemble Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of forest cover and its changes are essential for environmental change research, but current satellite products for forest coverage carry many uncertainties. This study used 30-m Landsat-8 data, and aggregated 1-m GaoFen-2 (GF-2) satellite images to construct the training samples and used multiple machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to estimate the fractional forest cover (FFC) in China's Three North Region (TNR). In this study, multiple MLAs were merged to construct stacked generalization (SG) models based on the idea of SG, and the performances of the MLAs in the FFC estimation were evaluated. The results of the 10-fold cross-validation showed that all non-linear algorithms had a good performance, with an R-2 value of greater than 0.8 and a root-mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.05. In the bagging ensemble, the random forest (RF) (R-2 = 0.993, RMSE = 0.020) model performed the best and in the boosting ensemble, the light gradient boosted machine (LGBM) (R-2 = 0.992, RMSE = 0.022) performed the best. Although the evaluation index of the RF is slightly better than that of the LGBM, the independent validation results show that the two models have similar performances. The model evaluation results of the independent datasets showed that, in the SG model, the performance of the SG(LGBM) (R-2 = 0.991, RMSE = 0.034) was better than that of the single or non-ensemble model. Comparing the FFC estimates of our model with those of existing datasets showed that our model exhibited more forest spatial distribution details and higher accuracy in complex landscapes. Overall, in this study, the method of using high-resolution remote sensing (RS) images to extract samples for FFC estimation is feasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of the ensemble MLAs to map the FFC. The research results also show that among many MALs, the RF algorithm is the most suitable algorithm for estimating FFC, which provides a reference for future research.

TI  - Improved Understanding of Groundwater Storage Changes under the Influence of River Basin Governance in Northwestern China Using GRACE Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is crucial for economic development in arid and semiarid areas. The Shiyang River Basin (SRB) has the most prominent water use issues in northwestern China, and overexploited groundwater resources have led to continuous groundwater-level decline. The key governance planning project of the SRB was issued in 2007. This paper synthetically combines remote-sensing data from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, land use, and in situ groundwater-level data to evaluate groundwater storage variations on a regional scale. Terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA), in addition to their influencing factors in the SRB since the implementation of the key governance project, are analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of governance. The results show that GRACE-derived GWS variations are consistent with in situ observation data in the basin, with a correlation coefficient of 0.68. The GWS in the SRB had a slow downward trend from 2003 to 2016, and this increased by 0.38 billion m(3)/year after 2018. As the meteorological data did not change significantly, the changes in water storage are mainly caused by human activities, which are estimated by using the principle of water balance. The decline in GWS in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB has been curbed since 2009 and has gradually rebounded since 2014. GWS decreased by 2.2 mm EWH (equivalent water height) from 2011 to 2016, which was 91% lower than that from 2007 to 2010. The cropland area in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB also stopped increasing after 2011 and gradually decreased after 2014, while the area of natural vegetation gradually increased, indicating that the groundwater level and associated ecology significantly recovered after the implementation of the project.

TI  - Mapping snow avalanche debris by object-based classification in mountainous regions from Sentinel-1 images and causative indices
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of satellite observation datasets, avalanche detection algorithms are not as accurate as visual interpretation, limiting avalanche hazard management. To bridge this gap, more advanced machine learning is proposed to map snow avalanche debris. Those techniques use Sentinel-1 SAR scattering characteristics and field observations with principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) in the western range of the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang, China. Specifically, the indicators in the snow avalanche debris samples described the time-shift variations, quantified by the variations from the ascending and descending image pairs. Then, combined with the causative factors, PCA-LR and PCASVM transformed point-monitoring at the regional scale. Finally, the snow avalanche debris distribution was detected (13.92 m). It was found that: (1) The accuracy of snow avalanche debris detection was not enhanced by ascending or descending image pairs. Although the ascending image results outweigh the descending ones, it underestimated the amount of debris with high miss and false detection rates. (2) The composite results of the ascending and descending adjacent image pairs were highly satisfactory for snow avalanche debris detection. Although the PCA-LR results narrowly overtook those for PCA-SVM (CSILR1 = 86.38 vs. CSISVM1 = 83.06, PODLR1 = 98.90 vs. PODSVM1 = 95.37; CSILR2 = 84.90 vs. CSISVM2 = 81.53, and PODLR2 = 98.56 vs. PODSVM2 = 94.15), both results overestimated the debris amounts (FBLR1 = 113.39 vs. FBSVM1 = 110.19; and FBLR2 = 114.64 vs. FBSVM2 = 109.64), with low miss and false detection rates (FARLR1 = 12.73 vs. FARSVM1 = 13.44; FARLR2 = 14.03 vs. FARSVM1 = 14.13). (3) False and missed detection of avalanche debris pixels occurred due to the SAR images' limitations and an incorrect signal from the massive, deep frost caused by thick snow. The high-accuracy approach using multiple orbits, polarizations, and terrain indices was encouraging because they revealed slab-and groove-type avalanche debris from noise filtering and speckle reduction.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer Using the Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Technique: A Validation Study
T2  - IIUM MEDICAL JOURNAL MALAYSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now recognized as the standard of care for early breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes. Various approaches for Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) identification using either the blue dye method or scintigraphy alone or their combination have been proposed. However, this method is costly and may not be applicable in certain developing countries. SLNB involving the use of indocyanine green (ICG) offers several advantages, and it is valid and safe when in direct comparison with the blue dye method and scintigraphy. Hence, we performed SLNB using this method in early breast cancer as the first center that involves the use of ICG in Malaysia. We performed validation study on this method with the aims to determine its sensitivity and safety profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a validation and non-randomised prospective observational study involving 20 patients underwent SLNB wherein ICG is used for localisation. The patients were recruited according to the recommendations stipulated in the Malaysia Clinical Practice Guideline. RESULT: The average number of SLNs removed per patient was 4.0 (range, 3-6) with sentinel lymph nodes detection rate at 98.75% (79/80). The false negative rate is at 5%. No adverse events were observed in all cases. CONCLUSION: The ICG fluorescence method is simple, reliable and safe. Moreover, it demonstrates a high SLN detection rate with a low false-negative rate, and it does not require a special instrument for radioisotope use.

T2  - UNICIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned changes in the use of high Andean territories have become more evident, leading to a loss of productive areas and important ecosystem services. Under this context, the objective of this study was to characterize the temporal changes in vegetation and land use in the high Andean district of Cabana (Peru). Vegetation types were determined based on the predominant species; these areas, together with the frequent forms of land use,were quantified using a supervised analysis of Landsat images with a 30 m spectral resolution, obtained during March and April 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016. Six types of plant associations were identified whose areas decreased 2000 ha, from the initial 12500 in 16 years (16.27%). By 2000 the Muhlenbergetum fastigiatae association had the highest coverage (43.96%), but in 2016 Calamagrostio vicunaro - Festucetum dolichophyllae predominated (47.31%). Crop areas increased from 5133 ha (27%) to 7115 ha (37%) of the district surface, while degraded soils extended from 35 to 120 ha, sparsely vegetated areas from 17 to 30 ha and wetland reduced from 179 to 29.7 ha. Urban coverage grew 40.7 % annually. Land use with no territorial ordering basis caused detriment in vegetation and compromised the sustainable use of natural resources.

TI  - An Improved Cloud Masking Method for GOCI Data over Turbid Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds severely hinder the radiative transmission of visible light; thus, correctly masking cloudy and non-cloudy pixels is a preliminary step in processing ocean color remote sensing data. However, cloud masking over turbid waters is prone to misjudgment, leading to loss of non-cloudy pixel data. This research proposes an improved cloud masking method over turbid water to classify cloudy and non-cloudy pixels based on spectral variability of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance acquired by the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI). Compared with other existing cloud masking methods, we demonstrated that this improved method can identify the spatial positions and shapes of clouds more realistically, and more accurate pixels of turbid waters were retained. This improved method can be effectively applied in typical turbid coastal waters. It has potential to be used in cloud masking procedures of spaceborne ocean color sensors without short-wave infrared bands.

TI  - Novel Machine Learning Method Integrating Ensemble Learning and Deep Learning for Mapping Debris-Covered Glaciers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) have a significant impact on human activity. Thus, a detailed and up-to-date inventory of glaciers is crucial, along with monitoring them regularly. The identification of debris-covered glaciers is a fundamental and yet challenging component of research into glacier change and water resources, but it is limited by spectral similarities with surrounding bedrock, snow-affected areas, and mountain-shadowed areas, along with issues related to manual discrimination. Therefore, to use fewer human, material, and financial resources, it is necessary to develop better methods to determine the boundaries of debris-covered glaciers. This study focused on debris-covered glacier mapping using a combination of related technologies such as random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The models were tested on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), selecting Eastern Pamir and Nyainqentanglha as typical glacier areas on the Tibetan Plateau to construct a glacier classification system. The performances of different classifiers were compared, the different classifier construction strategies were optimized, and multiple single-classifier outputs were obtained with slight differences. Using the relationship between the surface area covered by debris and the machine learning model parameters, it was found that the debris coverage directly determined the performance of the machine learning model and mitigated the issues affecting the detection of active and inactive debris-covered glaciers. Various classification models were integrated to ascertain the best model for the classification of glaciers.

TI  - Revisiting the Atlantic South Equatorial Current
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern branch of the South Equatorial Current (SSEC) is the northern limit of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. When this current reaches Brazil around 14 degrees S it bifurcates into a southward flow as the Brazil Current (BC) and the surface portion of the northward flowing North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC). The SSEC system is a key component of the western boundary supply, influencing the NBUC/BC variability and, therefore, global climate through the Meridional Overturning Circulation. In this study, using altimetry satellite data and reanalyzes outputs (1993-2018), we revisit the SSEC mean state and show this current arriving at the South Atlantic western boundary as a multi-banded flow with surface signatures resulting from different subsurface cores. These bands have velocities between 0.02 and 0.07 m s(-1) and, as shown by ADCP data from the PIRATA project, their signature in synoptic scenarios is obscured by eddies and waves with velocities between 0.1 and 0.3 m s(-1). In addition, the SSEC annual cycle analysis shows that the seasonality of the bands is out of phase with each other, presenting westward transport anomalies between 0.4 and 2.6 Sv. Finally, our results show that the seasonality of this multi-banded flow both defines where the BC is born, and modulates the seasonality of semi-permanent mesoscale eddies off Brazil.

TI  - Characterizing the Up-To-Date Land-Use and Land-Cover Change in Xiong'an New Area from 2017 to 2020 Using the Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Images on Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) are fundamental units of human activities. Therefore, it is of significance to accurately and in a timely manner obtain the LULC maps where dramatic LULC changes are undergoing. Since 2017 April, a new state-level area, Xiong'an New Area, was established in China. In order to better characterize the LULC changes in Xiong'an New Area, this study makes full use of the multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images, the cloud-computing Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the powerful classification capability of random forest (RF) models to generate the continuous LULC maps from 2017 to 2020. To do so, a novel multiple RF-based classification framework is adopted by outputting the classification probability based on each monthly composite and aggregating the multiple probability maps to generate the final classification map. Based on the obtained LULC maps, this study analyzes the spatio-temporal changes of LULC types in the last four years and the different change patterns in three counties. Experimental results indicate that the derived LULC maps achieve high accuracy for each year, with the overall accuracy and Kappa values no less than 0.95. It is also found that the changed areas account for nearly 36%, and the dry farmland, impervious surface, and other land-cover types have changed dramatically and present varying change patterns in three counties, which might be caused by the latest planning of Xiong'an New Area. The obtained 10-m four-year LULC maps in this study are supposed to provide some valuable information on the monitoring and understanding of what kinds of LULC changes have taken place in Xiong'an New Area.

TI  - A GNSS-IR Method for Retrieving Soil Moisture Content from Integrated Multi-Satellite Data That Accounts for the Impact of Vegetation Moisture Content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are two problems with using global navigation satellite system-interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) to retrieve the soil moisture content (SMC) from single-satellite data: the difference between the reflection regions, and the difficulty in circumventing the impact of seasonal vegetation growth on reflected microwave signals. This study presents a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) SMC retrieval model based on integrated multi-satellite data on the impact of the vegetation moisture content (VMC). The normalized microwave reflection index (NMRI) calculated with the multipath effect is mapped to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate and eliminate the impact of VMC. A MARS model for retrieving the SMC from multi-satellite data is established based on the phase shift. To examine its reliability, the MARS model was compared with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model, and a support vector regression (SVR) model in terms of the retrieval accuracy with time-series observation data collected at a typical station. The MARS model proposed in this study effectively retrieved the SMC, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.916 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.021 cm(3)/cm(3). The elimination of the vegetation impact led to 3.7%, 13.9%, 11.7%, and 16.6% increases in R-2 and 31.3%, 79.7%, 49.0%, and 90.5% decreases in the RMSE for the SMC retrieved by the MLR, BPNN, SVR, and MARS model, respectively. The results demonstrated the feasibility of correcting the vegetation changes based on the multipath effect and the reliability of the MARS model in retrieving the SMC.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Guided Spatial Sampling Strategy over Heterogeneous Surface Ground for Validation of Vegetation Indices Products with Medium and High Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS)-derived vegetation indices (VIs) with medium and high spatial resolution have emerged as a promising dataset for fine-scale ecosystem modeling and agricultural monitoring at local or global scales. Before they can be used as reliable inputs for other research, conducting in situ measurements for validation is very critical. However, the spatial heterogeneity due to the diversity of land cover and its spatial organization in the landscape increases the uncertainty of validation, so design of optimal sampling is an important basis for the reliability of the validation. In this paper, we propose an integrative stratified sampling strategy (INTEG-STRAT) based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data as prior knowledge. The basic idea is to realize a sampling optimization by determining the optimal combination of the spatial sampling method (e.g., simple random sampling (SRS), spatial system sampling (SYS), stratified sampling, generalized random tessellation stratified (GRTS), balanced acceptance sampling (BAS)) and spatial stratification scheme with an objective rule. The objective rule in this paper is to minimize the root mean square error (RMSE) of 10-fold cross validation between estimated values (sample are not included) and the corresponding values on prior knowledge. Relative precision, correlation coefficient, and RMSE are used to compare the effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy with each sampling method without considering sampling optimization. After comparing, we find that the INTEG-STRAT requires fewer samples to become stable and has higher accuracy. At site 1, when the correlation coefficient between NDVI image and the simulated NDVI surface reached 80%, INTEG-STRAT needed only 70 sampling points while other methods require more sampling points. At the same time, INTEG-STRAT strategy has a smaller RMSE between the estimated values and the corresponding values on prior knowledge image. In general, INTEG-STRAT is an effective method in the selection of representative samples to support the validation of vegetation indices products with medium and high spatial resolution.

TI  - What is the "lite" in "alt-lite?" The discourse of white vulnerability and dominance among YouTube's reactionaries
T2  - SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the discourse of "alt-lite" YouTube personalities in a North American context, with a focus on how whiteness is understood and represented. It argues that, despite their self-presentation as color-blind conservatives, these figures are firmly embedded within white supremacist ideology. A qualitative approach to content analysis is adopted to excavate the logics underlying these videos and to highlight the rhetorical tools at work. By framing themselves as the vulnerable targets of progressive movements, "alt-lite" personalities have helped to revive and legitimize a discourse of white victimhood. Their videos emphasize the historic dominance of "white culture" while bemoaning the current and future vulnerability of white people in a politically correct, social-justice-oriented world. Ultimately, the article argues that "alt-lite" figures are united by a set of mitigating rhetorical strategies, which are used to temper and obfuscate their reactionary views. These strategies include performatively aligning with one minority group to denigrate another; highlighting personal relationships with non-white people and knowledge of non-white cultures; embracing a color-blind worldview purportedly rooted in the civil rights movement; and maintaining ironic distance when espousing more overtly hateful racial stereotypes. The adoption of these strategies by right-wing micro-celebrities should not deter scholars and civil society groups from acknowledging when those same figures traffic in white supremacist rhetoric.

TI  - Assessment of Eutrophication and DOC Sources Tracing in the Sea Area around Dajin Island Using CASI and MODIS Images Coupled with CDOM Optical Properties
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea area around Dajin Island in the Pearl River Estuary is the second-largest habitat in China for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa Chinensis). However, the rapid economic development of this area brings potential threats to the aquatic ecology around Dajin Island. Real-time monitoring and evaluation of the ecological health of the sea area are urgent. In this study, band ratio and single-band inversion algorithms were performed to obtain Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC), relying on both Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images. The CASI/Chl-a with high spatial resolution was adopted to assess the eutrophication status, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties were used to derive the material composition and sources. The results suggest that the study area is under a low to medium eutrophication state with evenly distributed low Chl-a concentration. However, higher Chl-a is observed in the outer estuary with MODIS/Chl-a. The relatively high DOC concentration, especially in the north, where aquaculture is practiced, and near the estuary's main axis, i.e., east Dajin Island, indicates that the eutrophication state might be underestimated using satellite chlorophyll alone. CDOM optical properties indicated that terrestrial materials are the DOC's primary material sources, but the DOC derived from fishery aquaculture cannot be ignored. The low Chl-a concentration is likely due to the turbulent hydrodynamic regime caused by jet flow and reciprocating flow in this marine area. Comprehensive observation, including the assessment of different technological platforms, is suggested for the aquatic environment.

TI  - A Large Old Landslide in Sichuan Province, China: Surface Displacement Monitoring and Potential Instability Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) with small baseline subsets (SBAS) and Permanent Scatter Interferometry (PSI) techniques and C-band Sentinel-1A data, this research monitored the surface displacement of a large old landslide at Xuecheng town, Lixian County, Sichuan Province, China. Based on the MassMov2D model, the effect of the dynamic process and deposit thickness of the potentially unstable rock mass (deformation rate < -70 mm/year) on this landslide body were numerically simulated. Combined with terrain data and images generated by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the driving factors of this old landslide were analyzed. The InSAR results show that the motion rate in the middle part of the landslide body is the largest, with a range of -55 to -80 mm/year on average, whereas those of the upper part and toe area were small, with a range of -5 to -20 mm/year. Our research suggests that there is a correlation between the LOS (line of sight) deformation rate and rainfall. In rainy seasons, particularly from May to July, the deformation rate is relatively high. In addition, the analysis suggests that SBAS can provide smoother displacement time series, even in areas with vegetation and the steepest sectors of the landslide. The simulation results show that the unstable rock mass may collapse and form a barrier dam with a maximum thickness of about 16 m at the Zagunao river in the future. This study demonstrates that combining temporal UAV measurements and InSAR techniques from Sentinel-1A SAR data allows early recognition and deformation monitoring of old landslide reactivation in complex mountainous areas. In addition, the information provided by InSAR can increase understanding of the deformation process of old landslides in this area, which would enhance urban safety and assist in disaster mitigation.

TI  - Investigating the Relationship between Tree Species Diversity and Landsat-8 Spectral Heterogeneity across Multiple Phenological Stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of the spectral variation hypothesis (SVH) has gained widespread attention in the remote sensing community as a method for deriving biodiversity information from remotely sensed data. SVH states that spectral heterogeneity on remotely sensed imagery reflects environmental heterogeneity, which in turn is associated with high species diversity and, therefore, could be useful for characterizing landscape biodiversity. However, the effect of phenology has received relatively less attention despite being an important variable influencing plant species spectral responses. The study investigated (i) the effect of phenology on the relationship between spectral heterogeneity and plant species diversity and (ii) explored spectral angle mapper (SAM), the coefficient of variation (CV) and their interaction effect in estimating species diversity. Stratified random sampling was adopted to survey all tree species with a diameter at breast height of > 10 cm in 90 x 90 m plots distributed throughout the study site. Tree species diversity was quantified by the Shannon diversity index (H '), Simpson index of diversity (D-2) and species richness (S). SAM and CV were employed on Landsat-8 data to compute spectral heterogeneity. The study applied linear regression models to investigate the relationship between spectral heterogeneity metrics and species diversity indices across four phenological stages. The results showed that the end of the growing season was the most ideal phenological stage for estimating species diversity, following the SVH concept. During this period, SAM and species diversity indices (S, H ', D-2) had an r(2) of 0.14, 0.24, and 0.20, respectively, while CV had an r(2) of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.25, respectively. The interaction of SAM and CV improved the relationship between the spectral data and H ' and D-2 (from r(2) of 0.24 and 0.25 to r(2) of 0.32 and 0.28, respectively) at the end of the growing season. The two spectral heterogeneity metrics showed differential sensitivity to components of plant diversity. SAM had a high relationship with H ' followed by D-2 and then a lower relationship with S throughout the different phenological stages. Meanwhile, CV had a higher relationship with D-2 than other plant diversity indices and its relationship with S and H ' remained similar. Although the coefficient of determination was comparatively low, the relationship between spectral heterogeneity metrics and species diversity indices was statistically significant (p < 0.05) and this supports the assertion that SVH could be implemented to characterize plant species diversity. Importantly, the application of SVH should consider (i) the choice of spectral heterogeneity metric in line with the purpose of the SVH application since these metrics relate to components of species diversity differently and (ii) vegetation phenology, which affects the relationship that spectral heterogeneity has with plant species diversity.

TI  - Neotectonics from Geomorphic Indices: Highlights from Main Mantle Thrust (Pakistan)
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The collision of the Eurasian and Indian plates has resulted in two spatially offset subduction zones, the Makran subduction zone to the south and the Himalayan convergent margin to the north. The Main Mantle Thrust (MMT) and adjoining regions have a complex geomorphic setting and geological variations with a number of active faults that were connected with numerous major devastating earthquakes in the investigation. Our study was carried out to develop a DEM based geomorphometric approach to study the stream power model and hypsometric analysis along the MMT and surroundings to achieve rigorous investigation of its potential to delineate active topography. Active tectonics in this region has greatly influenced the drainage system and geomorphic expressions. The study area is a junction of three important mountain ranges (Hindu Kush-Karakorum-Himalayas) and thus is an ideal natural laboratory to investigate the relative tectonic activity resulting from the India-Eurasia collision. Morphotectonic and geomorphometric evaluations of the MMT and surrounding regions were conducted by associating various DEM derived geomorphometric indices such as steepness (K-s), hypsometric integral (HIs), Hack gradient index (SL) and concavity (theta). From the results obtained, we deduce that these combined procedures reveal the highly active deformed zones connected to neotectonics. Ground validations and Landsat satellite imagery also give clue about the active faults based on the offsetted channels, triangular facets and severely deformed topography.

TI  - Sub-City Scale Hourly Air Quality Forecasting by Combining Models, Satellite Observations, and Ground Measurements
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While multiple information sources exist concerning surface-level air pollution, no individual source simultaneously provides large-scale spatial coverage, fine spatial and temporal resolution, and high accuracy. It is, therefore, necessary to integrate multiple data sources, using the strengths of each source to compensate for the weaknesses of others. In this study, we propose a method incorporating outputs of NASA's GEOS Composition Forecasting model system with satellite information from the TROPOMI instrument and ground measurement data on surface concentrations. Although we use ground monitoring data from the Environmental Protection Agency network in the continental United States, the model and satellite data sources used have the potential to allow for global application. This method is demonstrated using surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide as a test case in regions surrounding five major US cities. The proposed method is assessed through cross-validation against withheld ground monitoring sites. In these assessments, the proposed method demonstrates major improvements over two baseline approaches which use ground-based measurements only. Results also indicate the potential for near-term updating of forecasts based on recent ground measurements.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OF A VINEYARD OF TABLE GRAPES (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) USING SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE IMAGERY
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Table grapes (Vitis vinifera) are one of the crops of highest economic and social relevance in Sonora, Mexico. Due to the scant precipitation and high evaporative demand of the zone, it is a crop with a high water requirement. Therefore, its production depends on the application of irrigation, and it is important to have precise and extensive estimation of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) to improve efficiency of irrigation in the short term. This research was carried out during 2018 and 2019 with the objective of developing and evaluating a model between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated with Sentinel-2 images, and the crop coefficient (K-c) determined with a covariance turbulence flux system (Eddy Covariance, EC) as an option for estimating the ETc of a vineyard of table grapes in Costa de Hermosillo, Sonora. Using NDVI and K-c data from 2018 records, a simple regression model was constructed with the start forced to the origin at the null coordinates (K-CNDVI = 0.9467 NDVI; R-2 = 0.74) as a base for ETc estimation. When the regression model was validated with daily 2019 data, an R-2 of 0.76 was obtained along with a CME of 0.11 by relating K-CNDVI Whereas by relating ETc vs. estimated ETc, an R-2 of 0.92 was found, and a CME of 0.67 mm d(-1). The results indicated that the ETc can be estimated with adequate precision and in an opportune manner with the proposed model. However, it was found that the model may underestimate ETc during the period of maximum crop development due to NDVI saturation. However, in the winter when the values of NDVI depend on the soil structural characteristics and on the remains of winter pruning, ETc tends to be overestimated.

T2  - NANOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoparticles of Human Serum Albumin (NC) labelled with Tc-99m are widely used in Nuclear Medicine and represent the gold-standard for the intraoperative detection of the sentinel lymph node in many kinds of cancer, mainly breast cancer and melanoma. A significant amount of radionuclides can be incorporated into the HSA particle, due to the multiple binding sites, and HSA-based nanocolloid catabolism is a fast and easy process that results in innocuous degradation products. NCs labelled with different isotopes represent an interesting radiopharmaceutical for extending diagnostic accuracy and surgical outcome, but the knowledge of the chemical bond between NCs and isotopes has not been fully elucidated, including information on its strength and specificity. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the physicochemical characteristics of the bond between NCs and Tc-99m and Ga-68 isotopes. Commercial kits of HSA-based nanocolloid particles (NanoAlbumon(R)) were used. For this purpose, we have primarily studied the kinetic orders of NC radiolabelling. Langmuir isotherms and pH effect on radiolabelling were tested and the stability of the radiometal complex was verified through competition reactions carried out in presence of different ligands. The future goal of our research is the development of inexpensive and instant kits, easily labelled with a wide spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic isotopes, thus facilitating the availability of versatile and multipurpose radiopharmaceuticals.

TI  - Domain-Adversarial Training of Self-Attention-Based Networks for Land Cover Classification Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of large-scale remote sensing labeled data has prompted researchers to develop increasingly precise and accurate data-driven models for land cover and crop classification (LC&CC). Moreover, with the introduction of self-attention and introspection mechanisms, deep learning approaches have shown promising results in processing long temporal sequences in the multi-spectral domain with a contained computational request. Nevertheless, most practical applications cannot rely on labeled data, and in the field, surveys are a time-consuming solution that pose strict limitations to the number of collected samples. Moreover, atmospheric conditions and specific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap that does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available dataset to the area of interest. In this paper, we investigate adversarial training of deep neural networks to bridge the domain discrepancy between distinct geographical zones. In particular, we perform a thorough analysis of domain adaptation applied to challenging multi-spectral, multi-temporal data, accurately highlighting the advantages of adapting state-of-the-art self-attention-based models for LC&CC to different target zones where labeled data are not available. Extensive experimentation demonstrated significant performance and generalization gain in applying domain-adversarial training to source and target regions with marked dissimilarities between the distribution of extracted features.

TI  - Analysis of the Future Land Use Land Cover Changes in the Gaborone Dam Catchment Using CA-Markov Model: Implications on Water Resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes have been observed in the Gaborone dam catchment since the 1980s. A comprehensive analysis of future LULC changes is therefore necessary for the purposes of future land use and water resource planning and management. Recent advances in geospatial modelling techniques and the availability of remotely sensed data have become central to the monitoring and assessment of both past and future environmental changes. This study employed the cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model combinations to simulate future LULC changes in the Gaborone dam catchment. Classified Landsat images from 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015 were used to simulate the likely LULCs in 2015 and 2035. Model validation compared the simulated and observed LULCs of 2015 and showed a high level of agreement with Kappa variation estimates of K-no (0.82), K-loc (0.82) and K-standard (0.76). Simulation results indicated a projected increase of 26.09%, 65.65% and 55.78% in cropland, built-up and bare land categories between 2015 and 2035, respectively. Reductions of 16.03%, 28.76% and 21.89% in areal coverage are expected for shrubland, tree savanna and water body categories, respectively. An increase in built-up and cropland areas is anticipated in order to meet the population's demand for residential, industry and food production, which should be taken into consideration in future plans for the sustainability of the catchment. In addition, this may lead to water quality and quantity (both surface and groundwater) deterioration in the catchment. Moreover, water body reductions may contribute to water shortages and exacerbate droughts in an already water-stressed catchment. The loss of vegetal cover and an increase in built-up areas may result in increased runoff incidents, leading to flash floods. The output of the study provides useful information for land use planners and water resource managers to make better decisions in improving future land use policies and formulating catchment management strategies within the framework of sustainable land use planning and water resource management.

TI  - Systematic Water Fraction Estimation for a Global and Daily Surface Water Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fresh water is a vital natural resource. Earth observation time-series are well suited to monitor corresponding surface dynamics. The DLR-DFD Global WaterPack (GWP) provides daily information on globally distributed inland surface water based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images at 250 m spatial resolution. Operating on this spatiotemporal level comes with the drawback of moderate spatial resolution; only coarse pixel-based surface water quantification is possible. To enhance the quantitative capabilities of this dataset, we systematically access subpixel information on fractional water coverage. For this, a linear mixture model is employed, using classification probability and pure pixel reference information. Classification probability is derived from relative datapoint (pixel) locations in feature space. Pure water and non-water reference pixels are located by combining spatial and temporal information inherent to the time-series. Subsequently, the model is evaluated for different input sets to determine the optimal configuration for global processing and pixel coverage types. The performance of resulting water fraction estimates is evaluated on the pixel level in 32 regions of interest across the globe, by comparison to higher resolution reference data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8). Results show that water fraction information is able to improve the product's performance regarding mixed water/non-water pixels by an average of 11.6% (RMSE). With a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.61, the model shows good overall performance. The approach enables the systematic provision of water fraction estimates on a global and daily scale, using only the reflectance and temporal information contained in the input time-series.

TI  - Fault motion reversals predating the M<sub>w</sub> 6.3 2009 L'Aquila earthquake: insights from synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The millimetre accuracy of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements and related multi-temporal data analyses provide fundamental information on surface displacements caused by strong earthquakes. The multi-temporal analysis of SAR interferometry data allows for the geometry, kinematics and temporal behaviour of earthquake-generating faults to be better constrained, and is being acknowledged as a promising technique in the field of earthquake precursors. We used SAR data obtained by multi-temporal interferometric techniques such as Permanent Scatterers (PS) interferometry for the investigation of pre- to post-seismic ground displacements in the region struck by the M-w 6.3, 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. We analysed Europen Remote Sensing (ERS) and Envisat PS-datasets from ascending and descending orbits, and COSMO-SkyMed PS-datasets from descending orbit, collectively covering a > 20 year long time span. On a yearly scale, a reversal of motions that affected the hanging-wall and footwall blocks of the earthquake-generating fault is detected. In particular, the hanging-wall block is characterized by pre-seismic uplift - which we document as being independent of any hydrological control - and eastward horizontal motion for about six years, followed by subsidence and westward motion (starting six to eight months prior to the earthquake). We suggest that such a ground displacement pattern may represent an earthquake precursor signal. Supplementary material: Figures showing SAR satellites viewing geometry, examples of raw PS time series of obtained from ERS ascending and descending orbits and maps of LoS-oriented mean velocities obtained from PS datasets from the Envisat ascending and descending orbits and a Table reporting detailed numerical results of the performed statistical analysis are available at

TI  - Vicarious trauma in therapists: a meta-ethnographic review
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Hearing about trauma can leave a mark on an individual, leading to a significant change in worldview that shatters their existing beliefs and is pervasive across view of self, other and the world. Individuals present with a range of symptoms that mimic post-traumatic stress disorder although the symptoms are less severe. Despite this, some individuals can experience growth through an enriched understanding of self and other. This altered perspective enables individuals to respond in ways that promote growth and positivity in their own lives.Aims: The aim of this review was to synthesise existing qualitative literature exploring how therapists experience working with trauma survivors.Method: A systematic literature search found 16 studies which were selected for review following the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality appraisal. Noblit and Hare's (1988) approach to meta-ethnography was followed.Results: The themes identified outline a cognitive model of vicarious trauma whereby therapists presented with cognitive, emotional, physiological and behavioural 'symptoms' due to marked changes in schemata following repeated exposure to trauma. The literature suggests that therapists experience growth and development alongside vicarious trauma through witnessing clients' resilience and growth.Conclusion: This meta-ethnographic review suggests that the impact of working with trauma is profound and complex for therapists bearing witness to their client's pain and concurrently, their growth.

TI  - Mapping of Flood Areas Using Landsat with Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Observation (EO) domain can provide valuable information products that can significantly reduce the cost of mapping flood extent and improve the accuracy of mapping and monitoring systems. In this study, Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were utilized to map flood inundation areas. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to implement Flood Mapping Algorithm (FMA) and process the Landsat data. FMA relies on developing a "data cube", which is spatially overlapped pixels of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery captured over a period of time. This data cube is used to identify temporary and permanent water bodies using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and site-specific elevation and land use data. The results were assessed by calculating a confusion matrix for nine flood events spread over the globe. The FMA had a high true positive accuracy ranging from 71-90% and overall accuracy in the range of 74-89%. In short, observations from FMA in GEE can be used as a rapid and robust hindsight tool for mapping flood inundation areas, training AI models, and enhancing existing efforts towards flood mitigation, monitoring, and management.

TI  - Mapping of <i>Kobresia pygmaea</i> Community Based on Umanned Aerial Vehicle Technology and Gaofen Remote Sensing Data in Alpine Meadow Grassland: A Case Study in Eastern of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kobresia pygmaea (KP) community is a key succession stage of alpine meadow degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, most of the grassland classification and mapping studies have been performed at the grassland type level. The spatial distribution and impact factors of KP on the QTP are still unclear. In this study, field measurements of the grassland vegetation community in the eastern part of the QTP (Counties of Zeku, Henan and Maqu) from 2015 to 2019 were acquired using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology. The machine learning algorithms for grassland vegetation community classification were constructed by combining Gaofen satellite images and topographic indices. Then, the spatial distribution of KP community was mapped. The results showed that: (1) For all field observed sites, the alpine meadow vegetation communities demonstrated a considerable spatial heterogeneity. The traditional classification methods can hardly distinguish those communities due to the high similarity of their spectral characteristics. (2) The random forest method based on the combination of satellite vegetation indices, texture feature and topographic indices exhibited the best performance in three counties, with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient ranged from 74.06% to 83.92% and 0.65 to 0.80, respectively. (3) As a whole, the area of KP community reached 1434.07 km(2), and accounted for 7.20% of the study area. We concluded that the combination of satellite remote sensing, UAV surveying and machine learning can be used for KP classification and mapping at community level.

TI  - Predicting seasonal influenza using supermarket retail records
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary Seasonal influenza is a major burden to the health care systems of countries. Machine learning approaches and data from external sources are increasingly used for flu forecasting in recent years. In this study, we explore whether the inclusion of retail records in a predictive model improves seasonal influenza forecasting. Specifically, we consider supermarket retail data as a proxy signal for influenza, through the identification of sentinel baskets, i.e., products bought together by a population of selected customers. We develop a nowcasting and forecasting framework that provides estimates for influenza incidence in Italy up to 4 weeks ahead. Our predictions outperform the baseline approaches thus proving the added value of incorporating retail market data in forecasting models.Increased availability of epidemiological data, novel digital data streams, and the rise of powerful machine learning approaches have generated a surge of research activity on real-time epidemic forecast systems. In this paper, we propose the use of a novel data source, namely retail market data to improve seasonal influenza forecasting. Specifically, we consider supermarket retail data as a proxy signal for influenza, through the identification of sentinel baskets, i.e., products bought together by a population of selected customers. We develop a nowcasting and forecasting framework that provides estimates for influenza incidence in Italy up to 4 weeks ahead. We make use of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to produce the predictions of seasonal flu incidence. Our predictions outperform both a baseline autoregressive model and a second baseline based on product purchases. The results show quantitatively the value of incorporating retail market data in forecasting models, acting as a proxy that can be used for the real-time analysis of epidemics.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of reported suicide deaths and attempts on veterans health administration campuses and inpatient units
T2  - BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the USA. Inpatient suicide is the fourth most common sentinel event reported to the Joint Commission. This study reviewed root cause analysis (RCA) reports of suicide events by hospital unit to provide suicide prevention recommendations for each area. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of reported suicide deaths and attempts in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. We searched the VHA National Center for Patient Safety RCA database for suicide deaths and attempts on inpatient units, outpatient clinics and hospital grounds, between December 1999 and December 2018. Results We found 847 RCA reports of suicide attempts (n=758) and deaths (n=89) in VHA hospitals, hanging accounted for 71% of deaths on mental health units and 50% of deaths on medical units. Overdose accounted for 55% of deaths and 68% of attempts in residential units and the only method resulting in death in emergency departments. In VHA community living centres, hanging, overdose and asphyxiation accounted for 64% of deaths. Gunshot accounted for 59% of deaths on hospital grounds and 100% of deaths in clinic areas. All inpatient locations cited issues in assessment and treatment of suicidal patients and environmental risk evaluation. Conclusions Inpatient mental health and medical units should remove anchor points for hanging where possible. On residential units and emergency departments, assessing suicide risk, conducting thorough contraband searches and maintaining observation of suicidal patients is critical. In community living centres, suicidal patients should be under supervision in an environment free of anchor points, medications and means of asphyxiation. Suicide prevention on hospital grounds and outpatient clinics can be achieved through the control of firearms.

TI  - Impact of meteorological drought on vegetation in non-irrigated lands
T2  - IDOJARAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural phenomenon that causes a lot of damages annually in various sectors, including agriculture and natural resources. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of meteorological drought index on vegetation index. For this purpose, the standard precipitation index (SPI) as a meteorological drought index is calculated using the precipitation data of 28 meteorological stations located on the area of Lorestane province, Iran, during the years 1987-2017. Then, the vegetation condition index (VCI) is computed using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images that obtained from MODIS images of Terra satellite during 2000-2017. Dry, normal, and wet years were obtained based on the SPI results for 2008, 2013, and 2016, respectively. SPI and VCI were correlated using Pearson's correlation method. The results of the relationship between VCI and SPI showed that the highest Pearson correlation coefficient related to 9month SPI in November was equal to 0.64. Multivariate linear regression was also performed between SPI and VCI, and the results showed that SPI was significantly correlated with VCI at 5% level over a period of 9 and 12 months. Finally, a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the compliance of the SPI and VCI drought classes. Results showed that the VCI had the highest compliance in the moderate drought class with SPI.

TI  - Development of a case definition for hearing loss in community-based older adults: a cross-sectional validation study.
T2  - CMAJ open
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
M3  - Validation Study
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research based in primary care suggests that hearing loss may be underreported as well as inconsistently recorded in patient histories. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a case definition for hearing loss among older adults in primary care, using electronic medical records.METHODS: We used data from adult patients aged 55 years and older from 13 practices in the Southern Alberta Primary Care Research Network database, part of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), from Dec. 1, 2014, to Dec. 31, 2016. We developed a hearing loss case definition that was translated into an electronic algorithm. A record review was undertaken as the reference standard, followed by application of the algorithm to the sample. Validation metrics included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, as well as prevalence. We assessed risk factors using the Fisher exact test and odds ratios.RESULTS: The sample included 1000 patients; 496 (49.6%) were female and the mean age was 67.5 (standard deviation 9.6) years. Sensitivity of the case definition algorithm was determined to be 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.5%-94.4%) with specificity valued at 94.8% (95% CI 93.1%-96.1%). Positive and negative predictive values were 52.9% (95% CI 42.8%-62.8%) and 99.1% (95% CI 98.2%-99.6%), respectively. The prevalence of hearing loss within the sample was 6.3% (95% CI 4.9%-7.9%). Older age was a significant risk factor for hearing loss (t = 4.98, 95% CI 3.76-8.65). Men had greater odds of hearing loss than women (odds ratio 1.65, 95% CI 0.98-2.79).INTERPRETATION: The validated case definition for hearing loss in community-based older adults had high sensitivity and specificity. It may be applied to surveillance and future epidemiologic research within the CPCSSN database.

TI  - A Nowcast/Forecast System for Japan's Coasts Using Daily Assimilation of Remote Sensing and In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed an ocean state nowcast/forecast system (JCOPE-T DA) that targets the coastal waters around Japan and assimilates daily remote sensing and in situ data. The ocean model component is developed based on the Princeton Ocean Model with a generalized sigma coordinate and calculates oceanic conditions with a 1/36-degree (2-3 km) resolution and an hourly result output interval. To effectively represent oceanic phenomena with a spatial scale smaller than 100 km, we adopted a data assimilation scheme that explicitly separates larger and smaller horizontal scales from satellite sea surface temperature data. Our model is updated daily through data assimilation using the latest available remote-sensing data. Here we validate the data assimilation products of JCOPE-T DA using various kinds of in situ observational data. This validation proves that the JCOPE-T DA model output outperforms those of a previous version of JCOPE-T, which is based on nudging the values of temperature and salinity toward those provided by a different coarse grid data-assimilated model JCOPE2M. Parameter sensitivity experiments show that the selection of horizontal scale separation parameters considerably affects the representation of sea surface temperature. Additional experiments demonstrate that the assimilation of daily-updated satellite sea surface temperature data actually improves the model's efficiency in representing typhoon-induced disturbances of sea surface temperature on a time scale of a few days. Assimilation of additional in situ data, such as temperature/salinity/ocean current information, further improves the model's ability to represent the ocean currents near the coast accurately.

TI  - A Review of Reconstructing Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature under Cloudy Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important environmental parameter in climate change, urban heat islands, drought, public health, and other fields. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is the main method used to obtain LST information over large spatial scales. However, cloud cover results in many data gaps in remotely sensed LST datasets, greatly limiting their practical applications. Many studies have sought to fill these data gaps and reconstruct cloud-free LST datasets over the last few decades. This paper reviews the progress of LST reconstruction research. A bibliometric analysis is conducted to provide a brief overview of the papers published in this field. The existing reconstruction algorithms can be grouped into five categories: spatial gap-filling methods, temporal gap-filling methods, spatiotemporal gap-filling methods, multi-source fusion-based gap-filling methods, and surface energy balance-based gap-filling methods. The principles, advantages, and limitations of these methods are described and discussed. The applications of these methods are also outlined. In addition, the validation of filled LST values' cloudy pixels is an important concern in LST reconstruction. The different validation methods applied for reconstructed LST datasets are also reviewed herein. Finally, prospects for future developments in LST reconstruction are provided.

TI  - Habitat Suitability Modeling for the Feeding Ground of Immature Albacore in the Southern Indian Ocean Using Satellite-Derived Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current study, remotely sensed sea surface ocean temperature (SST) and sea surface chlorophyll (SSC), an indicator of tuna abundance, were used to determine the optimal feeding habitat zone of the southern Indian Ocean (SIO) albacore using a habitat suitability model applied to the 2000-2016 Taiwanese longline fishery data. The analysis showed a stronger correlation between the 2-month lag SSC and standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) than 0-, 1-, 3-, and 4-month lag SSC. SST also exhibited a stronger correlation with standardized CPUE. Therefore, SST and SSC_2 were selected as final variables for model construction. An arithmetic mean model with SST and SSC_2 was deemed suitable to predict the albacore feeding habitat zone in the SIO. The preferred ranges of SSC_2 and SST for the feeding habitat of immature albacore were 0.07-0.09 mg m(-3) and 16.5-18.5 degrees C, respectively, and mainly centralized at 17.5 degrees C SST and 0.08 mg m(-3) SSC_2. The selected habitat suitability index model displayed a high correlation (R-2 = 0.8276) with standardized CPUE. Overall, temperature and ocean chlorophyll were found to be essential for albacore habitat formation in the SIO, consistent with previous studies. The results of this study can contribute to ecosystem-based fisheries management in the SIO by providing insights into the habitat preference of immature albacore tuna in the SIO.

TI  - Response of Multi-Incidence Angle Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 Data to Herbaceous Vegetation Features in the Lower Parana River Floodplain, Argentina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems play a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. In emergent vegetation targets, the occurrence of double-bounce scatter is indicative of the presence of water and can be valuable for hydrological monitoring. Double-bounce scatter would lead to an increase of sigma(0)(HH) over sigma(0)(VV) and a non-zero co-polarized phase difference (CPD). In the Lower Parana River floodplain, a total of 11 full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes from a wide range of incidence angles were acquired during a month. Flooded targets dominated by two herbaceous species were sampled: Schoenoplectus californicus (four sites, Bulrush marshes) and Ludwigia peruviana (three sites, Broadleaf marshes). As a general trend, sigma(0)(HH) was higher than sigma(0)(VV), especially at the steeper incidence angles. By modeling CPD with maximum likelihood estimations, we found results consistent with double-bounce scatter in two Ludwigia plots, at certain scene incidence angles. Incidence angle accounted for most of the variation on sigma(0)(HH), whereas emergent green biomass was the main feature influencing sigma(0)(HV). Multivariate models explaining backscattering variation included the incidence angle and at least two of these variables: emergent plant height, stem diameter, number of green stems, and emergent green biomass. This study provides an example of using CPD to decide on the contribution of double-bounce scatter and highlights the influence of vegetation biomass on radar response. Even with the presence of water below vegetation, the contribution of double-bounce scatter to C-band backscattering depends on scene incidence angles and may be negligible in dense herbaceous targets.

TI  - A simple approach for monitoring vegetation change using time series remote sensing analysis: A case study from the Thathe Vondo Area in Limpopo Province, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a simple approach of spatiotemporal change detection of vegetation cover based on analysis of time series remotely sensed images. The study was carried out at Thathe Vondo Area, which is characterised by episodic variation of vegetation gain and loss. This variation is attributable to timber and tea plantations and their production cycles, which periodically result in either vegetation gain or loss. The approach presented here was implemented on two ASTER images acquired in 2007 and 2017. It involved the combined use of band combination, unsupervised image classification and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) techniques. True colour composite (TCC) images for 2007 and 2017 were created from combination of bands 1, 2 and 3 in red, blue and green, respectively. The difference image of the TCC images was then generated to show the inconsistencies of vegetation cover between 2007 and 2017. For analytical simplicity and interpretability, the difference image was subjected to ISODATA unsupervised classification, which clustered pixels in the difference image into eight classes. Two ISODATA derived classes were interpreted as vegetation gain and one as vegetation loss. These classes were confimed as regions of vegetation gain and loss by NDVI values of 2007 and 2017. In addition, the polygons of vegetation gain and loss regions were created and superimposed over the TCC images to further demonstrate the spatiotemporal vegetation change in the area. The vegetation change statistics show vegetation gain and loss of 10.62% and 2.03%, respectively, implying a vegetation gain of 8.59% over the selected decade.Significance:Vegetation change detection is essential in environmental monitoring and management of an area. This study presents a simple approach for assessing vegetation change over time. The approach involves change detection through the difference of spectral values of vegetation pixels of time series remotely sensed images.

TI  - Assessment of Drought Impact on Net Primary Productivity in the Terrestrial Ecosystems of Mongolia from 2003 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has devastating impacts on agriculture and other ecosystems, and its occurrence is expected to increase in the future. However, its spatiotemporal impacts on net primary productivity (NPP) in Mongolia have remained uncertain. Hence, this paper focuses on the impact of drought on NPP in Mongolia. The drought events in Mongolia during 2003-2018 were identified using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS)-derived NPP was computed to assess changes in NPP during the 16 years, and the impacts of drought on the NPP of Mongolian terrestrial ecosystems was quantitatively analyzed. The results showed a slightly increasing trend of the growing season NPP during 2003-2018. However, a decreasing trend of NPP was observed during the six major drought events. A total of 60.55-87.75% of land in the entire country experienced drought, leading to a 75% drop in NPP. More specifically, NPP decline was prominent in severe drought areas than in mild and moderate drought areas. Moreover, this study revealed that drought had mostly affected the sparse vegetation NPP. In contrast, forest and shrubland were the least affected vegetation types.

TI  - Violence Against the Indigenous Women: Methodological and Ethical Recommendations for Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of more countries contributing to precise and comparable statistics on violence against women (VAW) is undeniable. Methodological adaptation is a very important aspect to increase the probability of women disclosing violence and safeguard their integrity. Research on VAW adapted to ethnic populations is scarce. Colombia has great ethnic diversity and is the country in the region with the second highest percentage of women reporting having suffered physical or sexual violence. However, statistics on VAW are limited, and no guidance or recommendations exist with respect to adapting the VAW research protocol to indigenous communities with unique forms of social organization. The indigenous Nasa community functions as a small society with its communal organization, own social norms, and indigenous customary law. In addition, the indigenous Nasa population has a worldview that is reflected in the way women suffer and face violence and discrimination. This article is based on a pilot survey that adapts and implements the WHO multicountry study's survey methodology on women's health and domestic VAW in three resguardos (communal lands) of the Nasa indigenous community in Colombia. The goal is to contribute to and improve the methodological adaptation of VAW research to cultural diversity, and simultaneously attempting to obtain high-quality data that can be comparable at the national and international levels. Recommendations for adaptation, ethical considerations, challenges, and implications for future studies with indigenous populations are discussed.

TI  - Building Structure Mapping on Level Terrains and Sea Surfaces in Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping building structures is crucial for environmental change and impact assessment, and is especially important to accurately estimate fossil fuel CO2 emissions from human settlements. In this regard, the objective of this study is to develop novel and robust methods using time-series data acquired from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to identify and map persistent building structures from coastal plains to high plateaus, as well as on the sea surface. From annual composites of SAR data in the two-dimensional VV-VH polarization space, we determined the VV-VH domain for detecting building structures, whose persistence was defined based on the number of times that a pixel was identified as a building in time-series data. Moreover, the algorithm accounted for misclassified buildings due to water-tree interactions in radar signatures and due to topography effects in complex mountainous landforms. The methods were tested in five cities (Bc Lieu, Ca Mau, Soc Trang, Tan An, and Phan ThiLATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND ACUTEt) in Vietnam located in different socio-environmental regions with a range of urban configurations. Using in-situ data and field observations, we validated the methods and found that the results were accurate, with an average false negative rate of 10.9% and average false positive rate of 6.4% for building detection. The algorithm could also detect small houses in rural settlements and in small islands such as in Hon Sn and Hon Tre. Over sea surfaces, the algorithm effectively identified lines of power poles connecting islands to the mainland, guard shacks in marine blood clam farms in Kien Giang, individual wind towers in the off-shore wind farm in Bf c Lieu, and oilrigs in the Vung Tau oil fields. The new approach was developed to be robust against variations in SAR incidence and azimuth angles. The results demonstrated the potential use of satellite dual-polarization SAR to identify persistent building structures annually across rural-urban landscapes and on sea surfaces with different environmental conditions.

TI  - Estimation of Suspended Sediment Concentration in Downstream of the Ba River Basin using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the tendency of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the river watersheds enables a better understanding of the hydromorphological properties of its basins and the associated processes. In addition, analyzing this trend is essential to address several important issues such as erosion, water pollution, human health risks, etc. Therefore, it is critical to determine a proper method to quantify spatio-temporal variability in SSC. In recent years, remote sensing and GIS technologies are being widely applied to support scientists, researchers, and environmental resource investigators to quickly and synchronously capture information on a large scale. The combination of remote sensing and GIS data will become the reliable and timely updated data source for the managers, researchers on many fields. There are several tools, software, algorithms being used in extracting information from satellites and support for the analysis, image interpretation, data collection. The information from satellite images related to water resources includes vegetational cover, flooding events on a large scale, rain forecast, population distribution, forest fire, landslide movements, sedimentation, etc., and especially information on water quality, sediment concentration. This paper presents the initial result from LANDSAT satellite image interpretation to investigate the amount of sediment carried downstream of the Ba river basin.

TI  - Assessment of Change in Urban Green Spaces Using Sentinel 2 MSI Data and GIS Techniques: A Case Study in Thanh Hoa City, Vietnam
T2  - INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of an assessment of change in urban green spaces in Thanh Hoa city (Vietnam). Sentinel 2 MSI data in 2015 and 2021 are used to calculate 3 parameters: percentage of green, weight of green types, and weight of proximity to green. These parameters are used to calculate the Weighted Urban Green Space Index (WUGSI). The final result shows the distribution of green space in the study area consisted of very high-quality green, high-quality green, moderate quality green, and low quality green. The obtained results show that the quality of urban green space in Thanh Hoa city has changed significantly in the period 2015-2021, in which the area with category "low quality green space" increased from 7.17% up to 9.48%; areas with category "very high-quality green space" reduced from 65.02% to 47.39%.

TI  - Extraction of Old Towns in Hangzhou (2000-2018) from Landsat Time Series Image Stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid urbanization in recent decades, more and more urban renewal has taken place in China. Meanwhile, the early developed areas without change have become old towns, which need special attention in future city planning. However, other than field surveys, there is no specific method to identify old towns. To fill this gap, we used time-series image stacks established from Landsat Surface Reflectance Tier 1 data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, facilitated by Global Urban Boundary (GUB), Essential Urban Land Use Categories (EULUC) and Global Artificial Impervious Area (GAIA) data. The LandTrendr change detection algorithm was applied to extract detailed information from 14 band/index trajectories. These features were then used as inputs to two methods of old town identification: statistical thresholding and random forest classification. We assessed these two methods in a rapidly developing large city, Hangzhou, and subsequently obtained overall accuracies of 81.33% and 90.67%, respectively. Red band, NIR band and related indices show higher importance in random forest classification, and the magnitude feature plays an outstanding role. The final map of Hangzhou during the 2000-2018 period shows that the old towns were concentrated in the downtown region near West Lake within the urban boundaries in 2000, and far fewer than the renewed areas. The results could serve as references in the provincial and national planning of future urban developments.

TI  - Research on Temporal and Spatial Resolution and the Driving Forces of Ecological Environment Quality in Coal Mining Areas Considering Topographic Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few years, under the combined effects of climate change and human factors, the ecological environment of coal mining areas has undergone tremendous changes. Therefore, the rapid and accurate quantitative assessments of the temporal and spatial evolution of the ecological environment quality is of great significance for the ecological restoration and development planning of coal mining areas. This study applied the ecological environment index after topographic correction to improve the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). Based on a series of Landsat images, the ecological environment quality of Yangquan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province from 1987 to 2020 was monitored and evaluated by an improved remote sensing ecological index. The results show that after topographic correction, the topographic effect of the remote sensing ecological index was greatly reduced, and its practicability was improved. From 1987 to 2020, the ecological environment quality of Yangquan Coal Mine was improved, and the mean of the RSEI increased from 0.4294 to 0.6379. The ecological environment quality of the six coal mines in the study area was improved. Among the six coal gangue dumps, the ecological environmental quality of D1, D2, D3, and D4 has improved, and the ecological environment quality of D5 and D6 worsened. The percentages of improved, unchanged, and degraded ecological environment quality in the entire coal mining area were 77.08%, 0.99%, and 21.93%, respectively. The global Moran's index was between 0.7929 and 0.9057, and it was shown that there was a strong positive correlation between the ecological environmental qualities of the study area, and that its spatial distribution was clustered rather than random. The LISA cluster map showed that the aggregation and dispersion degree of ecological environment quality was mainly high-high clustering and low-low clustering over the whole stage. During the study period, temperature and precipitation had limited impacts on the ecological environment quality of Yangquan Coal Mine, while the coal mining activities and urbanization construction seriously affected the local ecological environment quality and the implementation of ecological restoration policies, regulations, and measures was the main reason for the improvement of the ecological environment quality.

TI  - Spatiotemporal image fusion in Google Earth Engine for annual estimates of land surface phenology in a heterogenous landscape
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, quantifying phenology at landscape to regional scales is not feasible with field data or near-surface sensors. Consequently, the spatial and temporal complexity of phenology has been assessed using satellitebased estimates (land surface phenology, LSP). While estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) capture intraannual patterns of phenology, they have relatively low spatial resolution. Estimates from sensors like Landsat capture finer spatial detail but are often limited by Landsat?s temporal resolution. We implemented a spatio-temporal image fusion method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and used the resulting dense time series of images to estimate intraannual LSP at 30-meter resolution. We utilized Landsat 8 surface reflectance and MODIS NBAR (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance; MCD43A4) images from 2016 and 2017 in the interior Pacific Northwest of the United States. Images predicted from the GEE image fusion algorithm were evaluated with true Landsat observations and compared with the accuracy achieved by executing the original ESTARFM algorithm. Excluding snow and cloud obscured observations, the algorithm produced approximately 215 observations per 30-meter pixel in 2017. Root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the GEE predicted images ranged from 0.032 to 0.066, and the RMSPE for the original ESTARFM predicted images from the ranged from 0.027 to 0.064. Phenometric estimates were evaluated with near-surface sensors (PhenoCams) in shrubland, conifer, and agricultural sites and field observations of phenology in grassland, open-pine, and mixed-conifer sites. Although phenometric estimates were dissimilar at all PhenoCam sites, the general temporal pattern of the GEE image fusion and PhenoCam time series was often similar. The start of season derived from the GEE image fusion time series had closer correspondence to the PhenoCam-derived start of season at the shrubland site (13 days) than the agriculture and conifer sites. The end of season was closest at one of the conifer sites and the agriculture site (22 and 31 days, respectively). Trends of some of the field-based phenology observations aligned with phenometrics estimated from the image fusion time series. At the grassland and open-pine field sites, the phenometrics from GEE image fusion were associated with phenophase trends of dominant plant functional types. Though characterizing LSP within the interior Pacific Northwest remains a challenge, this study demonstrates that image fusion implemented in GEE can produce a densified time series capable of capturing seasonal trends in NDVI related to vegetation phenology, which can be used to estimate intraannual phenometrics.

TI  - Global Sensitivity Analysis for Canopy Reflectance and Vegetation Indices of Mangroves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been applied to map the extent and biophysical properties of mangroves. However, the impact of several critical factors, such as the fractional cover and leaf-to-total area ratio of mangroves, on their canopy reflectance have rarely been reported. In this study, a systematic global sensitivity analysis was performed for mangroves based on a one-dimensional canopy reflectance model. Different scenarios such as sparse or dense canopies were set up to evaluate the impact of various biophysical and environmental factors, together with their ranges and probability distributions, on simulated canopy reflectance spectra and selected Sentinel-2A vegetation indices of mangroves. A variance-based method and a density-based method were adopted to compare the computed sensitivity indices. Our results showed that the fractional cover and leaf-to-total area ratio of mangrove crowns were among the most influential factors for all examined scenarios. As for other factors, plant area index and water depth were influential for sparse canopies while leaf biochemical properties and inclination angles were more influential for dense canopies. Therefore, these influential factors may need attention when mapping the biophysical properties of mangroves such as leaf area index. Moreover, a tailored sensitivity analysis is recommended for a specific mapping application as the computed sensitivity indices may be different if a specific input configuration and sensitivity analysis method are adopted.

TI  - Comparing Three Machine Learning Techniques for Building Extraction from a Digital Surface Model
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic building extraction from high-resolution remotely sensed data is a major area of interest for an extensive range of fields (e.g., urban planning, environmental risk management) but challenging due to urban morphology complexity. Among the different methods proposed, the approaches based on supervised machine learning (ML) achieve the best results. This paper aims to investigate building footprint extraction using only high-resolution raster digital surface model (DSM) data by comparing the performance of three different popular supervised ML models on a benchmark dataset. The first two methods rely on a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and a classical ML (support vector machine (SVM)) or a shallow neural network (extreme learning machine (ELM)) classifier, and the third model is a fully convolutional network (FCN) based on deep learning with transfer learning. Used data were obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) and cover the urban areas of Vaihingen an der Enz, Potsdam, and Toronto. The results indicated that performances of models based on shallow ML (feature extraction and classifier training) are affected by the urban context investigated (F1 scores from 0.49 to 0.81), whereas the FCN-based model proved to be the most robust and best-performing method for building extraction from a high-resolution raster DSM (F1 scores from 0.80 to 0.86).

TI  - Assessing natural resource change in Vhembe biosphere and surroundings
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa is a custodian of an immense wealth of natural and biodiversity resources in Africa. Natural resources are continually changing in different South African biospheres based on anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic causes. Land use activities like agriculture, cultivation, livestock rearing, commercial plantations, urbanisation and mining are among the major drivers of natural resource change and transformation. In this study, land cover change assessment was used to assess natural resource change in Vhembe biosphere and surroundings. To assess natural resource change in Vhembe biosphere, land use land cover change assessment was conducted using South African's national land-cover dataset, generated from multi-seasonal Landsat 5 and Sentinel-2 images. The 72x class land cover map was re-classified into 12x classes to fit the study objectives. Eight out of twelve classes quantified in hectares: indigenous forests, thicket/dense bush, natural woodland, shrubland, grassland, water bodies and wetlands were categorised as natural resources for which the natural resource change assessment for this study was based. Assessment findings established that land use and its related activities have contributed substantially to natural resource change where cultivated commercial, natural woodland and built-up residential contributed the most significant upward change in hectarage and percentage, from 132,246.9 to 365,644.92 (ha)-percentage change of 176%; from 94,665.42 to 257,889.68 (ha)-percentage changes of 172% and from 74,070.27 to 147,701.88(ha)-percentage change of 99% respectively. Shrubland, thicket/dense bush and indigenous forests registered the highest downward changes from 263,070.6 to 977.72 (ha); from 338,723.7 to 23,166.92 and from 13,211.91 to 7402.92 (ha) with percentage changes of -100%, -93% and -44% respectively in Vhembe biosphere and the surroundings from 1990 to 2018. The study showed how natural resources are changing and the use of remote sensing for environmental monitoring and assessment in the Vhembe district.

Within the German sentinel system, to monitor acute respiratory infections (ARI), 4463 respiratory specimens collected from outpatients < 5 years of age between October 2015 and September 2019 were retrospectively screened for HPIV 1-4 using real-time PCR. HPIV was identified in 459 (10%) samples. HPIV-3 was the most common HPIV-type, with 234 detections, followed by HPIV-1 (113), HPIV-4 (61), and HPIV-2 (49). HPIV-3 was more frequently associated with age < 2 years, and HPIV-4 was more frequently associated with pneumonia compared to other HPIV types. HPIV circulation displayed distinct seasonal patterns, which appeared to vary by type. Phylogenetic characterization clustered HPIV-1 in Clades 2 and 3. Reclassification was performed for HPIV-2, provisionally assigning two distinct HPIV-2 groups and six clades, with German HPIV-2s clustering in Clade 2.4. HPIV-3 clustered in C1, C3, C5, and, interestingly, in A. HPIV-4 clustered in Clades 2.1 and 2.2. The results of this study may serve to inform future approaches to diagnose and prevent HPIV infections, which contribute substantially to ARI in young children in Germany.

TI  - Tar Spot Disease Quantification Using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tar spot is a foliar disease of corn characterized by fungal fruiting bodies that resemble tar spots. The disease emerged in the U.S. in 2015, and severe outbreaks in 2018 caused an economic impact on corn yields throughout the Midwest. Adequate epidemiological surveillance and disease quantification are necessary to develop immediate and long-term management strategies. This study presents a measurement framework that evaluates the disease severity of tar spot using unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)-based plant phenotyping and regression techniques. UAS-based plant phenotypic information, such as canopy cover, canopy volume, and vegetation indices, were used as explanatory variables. Visual estimations of disease severity were performed by expert plant pathologists per experiment plot basis and used as response variables. Three regression methods, namely ordinary least squares (OLS), support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were used to determine an optimal regression method for UAS-based tar spot measurement. The cross-validation results showed that the regression model based on MLP provides the highest accuracy of disease measurements. By training and testing the model with spatially separated datasets, the proposed regression model achieved a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (rho(c)) of 0.82 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.42. This study demonstrated that we could use the proposed UAS-based method for the disease quantification of tar spot, which shows a gradual spectral response as the disease develops.

TI  - Diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs): Guidelines of Interdisciplinary Group of Polish Professionals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Considerable prevalence in Poland and serious health consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure indicated the need to develop national guidelines for the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). It was assumed that the guidelines must be in line with international standards but adjusted to the Polish context. (2) Methods: Work on recommendations was carried out by an interdisciplinary team of Polish specialists. Its first stage was to assess the usefulness in our country of the U.S. and Canadian guidelines. In the second stage, after several rounds of discussions, a consensus was achieved. (3) Results: The Polish guidelines for diagnosing FASD cover the following issues: 1. distinguished diagnostic categories; 2. diagnostic procedure; 3. assessment of prenatal exposure to alcohol; 4. assessment of sentinel facial dysmorphias; 5. assessment of body weight, height, and head circumference; 6. neurodevelopmental assessment. An important element of the recommendation is appendices containing practical tools that are useful in the diagnostic procedure. (4) Conclusions: National guidelines may improve the quality and standardization of FASD diagnosis in Poland, but their practical utility has to be monitored.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of the culture and susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori in peruvian patients: results from a sentinel laboratory.
T2  - Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to 5 reference antibiotics, in a population of 500 dyspeptic patients from the Gastroenterology Service of the Cayetano Heredia Hospital (n = 419) and the Cayetano Heredia Clinic (n = 81) in Lima, Peru.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric biopsies were collected from 500 patients diagnosed with dyspepsia. From these biopsies, 273 H. pylori strains were isolated and cultured to confirm H. pylori infection by histological and culture diagnosis. Finally, antimicrobial susceptibility was analyzed using the broth microdilution method, and the resistance profiles of each antimicrobial and multi-resistance patterns were evaluated by statistical analysis.RESULTS: The diagnosis of H. pylori infection by culture, compared to histological testing, reported a sensitivity of 83.8%, a specificity of 89.9% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84 to 0.90). The frequency of infection in the gastroenterology services of the Cayetano Heredia Hospital and Clinic was 56.6% (237/419) and 44.4% (36/81), respectively. An increase in antimicrobial resistance to Amoxicillin (45.1% / 29.6%), Levofloxacin (71.8%/ 74.1%) and Metronidazole (69.8% / 63.0%) was found in the Hospital and the Clinic, respectively. Multiple resistance patterns showed that the most frequent resistance (double and triple) was to Levofloxacin, Metronidazole and Amoxicillin.CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori has increased compared to that reported in previous years. Furthermore, H. pylori multiple resistance presents high frequencies in infected patients. The broth microdilution method could be implemented in different hospitals in Peru as a surveillance tool for H. pylori antimicrobial resistance.

Finalmente, se analizo la susceptibilidad antimicrobiana mediante el metodo de microdilucion en caldo y se evaluaron los perfiles de resistencia de cada antimicrobiano y los patrones de multirresistencia.RESULTADOS: El diagnostico de H.pylori por cultivo, comparado con la prueba histologica, reporto una sensibilidad del 83,8%, una especificidad del 89,9% y un area bajo la curva de 0,87 (IC95%: 0,84 a 0,90). La frecuencia de la infeccion en los servicios de gastroenterologia del Hospital y la Clinica Cayetano Heredia fueron del 56,6% (237/419) y 44,4% (36/81), respectivamente. Segun el Hospital/Clinica, se determino la resistencia para amoxicilina (45,1%/29,6%), levofloxacino (71,8%/74,1%) y metronidazol (69,8%/63,0%). Los patrones de resistencia a multiples antimicrobianos demostraron que las resistencias (dobles y triples) mas frecuentes fueron con levofloxacino, metronidazol y amoxicilina.CONCLUSIONES: La resistencia antimicrobiana de H.pylori ha aumentado con respecto a los anos previos. Ademas, la resistencia multiple de H.pylori presenta altas frecuencias en pacientes infectados. El metodo de microdilucion en caldo podria ser implementado en los diferentes hospitales del Peru como una herramienta de vigilancia de la resistencia de H.pylori a los antimicrobianos.

TI  - A Scoping Review of West Nile Virus Seroprevalence Studies among African Equids
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Review
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging and re-emerging zoonotic flavivirus first identified in and endemic to Africa. The virus is transmitted between birds by biting mosquitoes, with equids and humans being incidental hosts. The majority of infected incidental hosts display no or only mild clinical signs, but a fraction develop encephalitis. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and evaluate primary research on the presence of antibodies to WNV among African equids. Three bibliographic databases and the grey literature were searched. Of 283 articles identified, only 16 satisfied all the inclusion criteria. Data were collated on study design and outcomes. The overall seroprevalence reported ranged from 17.4 to 90.3%, with 1998 (35%) of the 5746 horses, donkeys and mules having screened positive for WNV antibodies. Several articles determined that seroprevalence increased significantly with age. Due to co-circulation of other flaviviruses in Africa, in the majority of studies that screened samples by ELISA, positive results were confirmed using a more specific neutralization test. However, only eight studies tested against other flaviviruses, including Potiskum, Uganda S, Wesselsbron and yellow fever virus in one, Japanese encephalitis and Usutu virus (USUV) in one, tick-borne encephalitis and USUV in one and USUV only in three. Equids are regarded as useful sentinel animals for WNV, but variation in study design poses challenges when trying to determine risk factors for, and trends in, WNV seroprevalence.

TI  - Object Oriented Classification for Mapping Mixed and Pure Forest Stands Using Very-High Resolution Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of mixed forests is increasingly recognized on a scientific level, due to their greater productivity and efficiency in resource use, compared to pure stands. However, a reliable quantification of the actual spatial extent of mixed stands on a fine spatial scale is still lacking. Indeed, classification and mapping of mixed populations, especially with semi-automatic procedures, has been a challenging issue up to date. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Very-High-Resolution imagery (VHR) to detect and map mixed forests of broadleaves and coniferous trees with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 500 m(2). This study evaluates segmentation-based classification paired with non-parametric method K- nearest-neighbors (K-NN), trained with a dataset independent from the validation one. The forest area mapped as mixed forest canopies in the study area amounts to 11%, with an overall accuracy being equal to 85% and K of 0.78. Better levels of user and producer accuracies (85-93%) are reached in conifer and broadleaved dominated stands. The study findings demonstrate that the very high resolution images (0.20 m of spatial resolutions) can be reliably used to detect the fine-grained pattern of rare mixed forests, thus supporting the monitoring and management of forest resources also on fine spatial scales.

TI  - COVID-19 Impacts on Beaches and Coastal Water Pollution at Selected Sites in Ecuador, and Management Proposals Post-pandemic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged Governments all around the world to implement confinement and social distancing measures. Leisure and business activities on beaches and in ports have restricted direct and indirect contamination from, for example, plastics, hydrocarbon spillage, microbiological loads, and noise levels. This has led to temporarily improved environmental conditions, and the beaches having conditions closer to Marine Protected Areas. Here we report some impacts that have been studied using local surveys and qualitative observations in Ecuador at the popular beaches and ports of Salinas, Manta, and Galapagos. Satellite data support this information. Online surveys were carried out at critical moments of the pandemic: May (15th) and just after when measures were relaxed a little, but within lockdown in July (21st) 2020. Respondents were asked to compare conditions before and during the pandemic lockdown. Most (97-99%) suggested that beaches had significantly improved from visual observations during confinement. On a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), the beaches of Salinas and Manta respectively were rated 2.2 and 2.8 (less than acceptable) before quarantine, and 4.5 and 4.3 after; results from the second survey (after 18 weeks of restrictions) were much the same. Replies from Galapagos showed a similar trend but with less marked differences. In addition to the beaches having less plastic and garbage, more fish, and large marine organisms, including humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), dolphin (bottlenose, Tursiops truncatus), and manta ray (Manta sp.) were observed near to shore. At Galapagos beaches, turtles, sea lions, and sharks were observed many more times than pre COVID. Quantitative satellite data on Chlorophyl and attenuation coefficient (Kd, 490 nm) support the qualitative survey data that there is an improvement in coastal environment quality. Here we recommend that this unique opportunity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is used locally, regionally and globally to construct baseline data sets that include information on physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological factors in coastal zones. These parameters can then help establish an effective Coastal Zone Management Plan based on beach description and quality (water standards, noise pollution), as well as the human dimension (tourist load, cultural heritage, and economic value indices). This data and information gathering ideally should be done before the beaches become more heavily used again as the pandemic recedes.

TI  - The Methodology for Identifying Secondary Succession in Non-Forest Natura 2000 Habitats Using Multi-Source Airborne Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The succession process of trees and shrubs is considered as one of the threats to non-forest Natura 2000 habitats. Poland, as a member of the European Union, is obliged to monitor these habitats and preserve them in the best possible condition. If threats are identified, it is necessary to take action-as part of the so-called active protection-that will ensure the preservation of habitats in a non-deteriorated condition. At present, monitoring of Natura 2000 habitats is carried out in expert terms, i.e., the habitat conservation status is determined during field visits. This process is time- and cost-intensive, and it is subject to the subjectivism of the person performing the assessment. As a result of the research, a methodology for the identification and monitoring of the succession process in non-forest Natura 2000 habitats was developed, in which multi-sensor remote sensing data are used-airborne laser scanner (ALS) and hyperspectral (HS) data. The methodology also includes steps required to analyse the dynamics of the succession process in the past, which is done using archival photogrammetric data (aerial photographs and ALS data). The algorithms implemented within the methodology include structure from motion and dense image matching for processing the archival images, segmentation and Voronoi tessellation for delineating the spatial extent of succession, machine learning random forest classifier, recursive feature elimination and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding algorithms for succession species differentiation, as well as landscape metrics used for threat level analysis. The proposed methodology has been automated and enables a rapid assessment of the level of threat for a whole given area, as well as in relation to individual Natura 2000 habitats. The prepared methodology was successfully tested on seven research areas located in Poland.

TI  - Irrigation Amounts and Timing Retrieval through Data Assimilation of Surface Soil Moisture into the FAO-56 Approach in the South Mediterranean Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural water use represents more than 70% of the world's freshwater through irrigation water inputs that are poorly known at the field scale. Irrigation monitoring is thus an important issue for optimizing water use in particular with regards to the water scarcity that the semi-arid regions are already facing. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a new approach to predict seasonal to daily irrigation timing and amounts at the field scale. The method is based on surface soil moisture (SSM) data assimilated into a simple land surface (FAO-56) model through a particle filter technique based on an ensemble of irrigation scenarios. The approach is implemented in three steps. First, synthetic experiments are designed to assess the impact of the frequency of observation, the errors on SSM and the a priori constraints on the irrigation scenarios for different irrigation techniques (flooding and drip). In a second step, the method is evaluated using in situ SSM measurements with different revisit times (3, 6 and 12 days) to mimic the available SSM product derived from remote sensing observation. Finally, SSM estimates from Sentinel-1 are used. Data are collected on different wheat fields grown in Morocco, for both flood and drip irrigation techniques in addition to rainfed fields used for an indirect evaluation of the method performance. Using in situ data, accurate results are obtained. With an observation every 6 days to mimic the Sentinel-1 revisit time, the seasonal amounts are retrieved with R > 0.98, RMSE < 32 mm and bias < 2.5 mm. Likewise, a good agreement is observed at the daily scale for flood irrigation as more than 70% of the detected irrigation events have a time difference from actual irrigation events shorter than 4 days. Over the drip irrigated fields, the statistical metrics are R = 0.74, RMSE = 24.8 mm and bias = 2.3 mm for irrigation amounts cumulated over 15 days. When using SSM products derived from Sentinel-1 data, the statistical metrics on 15-day cumulated amounts slightly dropped to R = 0.64, RMSE = 28.7 mm and bias = 1.9 mm. The metrics on the seasonal amount retrievals are close to assimilating in situ observations with R = 0.99, RMSE = 33.5 mm and bias = -18.8 mm. Finally, among four rainfed seasons, only one false event was detected. This study opens perspectives for the regional retrieval of irrigation amounts and timing at the field scale and for mapping irrigated/non irrigated areas.

TI  - Achieving High Poliovirus Antibody Seroprevalence in Areas at Risk of Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Transmission-Niger Experience.
T2  - Open forum infectious diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) continue to expand across Africa. We conducted a serological survey of polio antibodies in high-polio risk areas of Niger to assess risk of poliovirus outbreaks.METHODS: Children between 1 and 5 years of age were enrolled from structures randomly selected using satellite imaging enumeration in Diffa Province, Niger, in July 2019. After obtaining informed consent, dried blood spot cards were collected. Neutralizing antibodies against 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected using microneutralization assay at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.RESULTS: We obtained analyzable data from 309/322 (95.9%) enrolled children. Seroprevalence of polio antibodies was 290/309 (93.9%), 272/309 (88.0%), and 254/309 (82.2%) for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For serotypes 1 and 2, the seroprevalence did not significantly change with age (P = .09 and P = .44, respectively); for serotype 3, it increased with age (from 65% in 1-2-year-olds to 91.1% in 4-5-year olds; P < .001). We did not identify any risk factors for type 2 seronegativity.CONCLUSIONS: With type 2 seroprevalence close to 90%, the risk of emergence of new cVDPV2 outbreaks in Niger is low; however, the risk of cVDPV2 importations from neighboring countries leading to local transmission persists. Niger should maintain its outbreak response readiness capacity and further strengthen its routine immunization.

TI  - A Framework of Filtering Rules over Ground Truth Samples to Achieve Higher Accuracy in Land Cover Maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing (RS) digital classification techniques require sufficient, accurate and ubiquitously distributed ground truth (GT) samples. GT is usually considered "true" per se; however, human errors, or differences in criteria when defining classes, among other reasons, often undermine this veracity. Trusting the GT is so crucial that protocols should be defined for making additional quality checks before passing to the classification stage. Fortunately, the nature of RS imagery allows setting a framework of quality controls to improve the confidence in the GT areas by proposing a set of filtering rules based on data from the images themselves. In our experiment, two pre-existing reference datasets (rDS) were used to obtain GT candidate pixels, over which inconsistencies were identified. This served as a basis for inferring five key filtering rules based on NDVI data, a product available from almost all RS instruments. We evaluated the performance of the rules in four temporal study cases (under backdating and updating scenarios) and two study areas. In each case, a set of GT samples was extracted from the rDS and the set was used both unfiltered (original) and filtered according to the rules. Our proposal shows that the filtered GT samples made it possible to solve usual problems in wilderness and agricultural categories. Indeed, the confusion matrices revealed, on average, an increase in the overall accuracy of 10.9, a decrease in the omission error of 16.8, and a decrease in the commission error of 14.0, all values in percent points. Filtering rules corrected inconsistencies in the GT samples extracted from the rDS by considering inter-annual and intra-annual differences, scale issues, multiple behaviours over time and labelling misassignments. Therefore, although some intrinsic limitations have been detected (as in mixed forests), the protocol allows a much better Land Cover mapping thanks to using more robust GT samples, something particularly important in a multitemporal context in which accounting for phenology is essential.

TI  - Mapping Winter Crops Using a Phenology Algorithm, Time-Series Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7/8 Images, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing population and continuation of climate change, an adequate food supply is vital to economic development and social stability. Winter crops are important crop types in China. Changes in winter crops planting areas not only have a direct impact on China's production and economy, but also potentially affects China's food security. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain information on the planting of winter crops. In this study, we use the time series data of individual pixels, calculate the temporal statistics of spectral bands and the vegetation indices of optical data based on the phenological characteristics of specific vegetation or crops and record them in the time series data, and apply decision trees and rule-based algorithms to generate annual maps of winter crops. First, we constructed a dataset combining all the available images from Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2A/B. Second, we generated an annual map of land cover types to obtain the cropland mask in 2019. Third, we generated a time series of a single cropland pixel, and calculated the phenological indicators for classification by extracting the differences in phenological characteristics of different crops: these phenological indicators include SOS (start of season), SDP (start date of peak), EOS (end of season), GUS (green-up speed) and GSL (growing-season length). Finally, we identified winter crops in 2019 based on their phenological characteristics. The main advantages of the phenology-based algorithm proposed in this study include: (1) Combining multiple sensor data to construct a high spatiotemporal resolution image collection. (2) By analyzing the whole growth season of winter crops, the planting area of winter crops can be extracted more accurately, and (3) the phenological indicators of different periods are extracted, which is conducive to monitoring winter crop planting information and seasonal dynamics. The results show that the algorithm constructed in this study can accurately extract the planting area of winter crops, with user, producer, overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients of 96.61%, 94.13%, 94.56% and 0.89, respectively, indicating that the phenology-based algorithm is reliable for large area crop classification. This research will provide a point of reference for crop area extraction and monitoring.

TI  - Application of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry method (PSI) in Limon, Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present research was to apply the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) method in the city of Limon, Costa Rica, in order to estimate surface deformation velocity. The investigation is of descriptive nature and use is made of radar imagery from the Sentinel-1 mission pre-processed with SNAP software of the European Space Agency. Line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and time series were estimated using the StaMPS software resulting in velocities in the range of -11 mm/yr(5) to +20 mm/yr. It is concluded that the method has practical potential in Costa Rica for surface dynamics research and instances where no data is available from other methods such as GNSS.

TI  - U-IMG2DSM: Unpaired Simulation of Digital Surface Models With Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) provide valuable height information about the Earth's surface, which can be successfully combined with other types of remotely sensed data in a wide range of applications. However, the acquisition of DSMs with high spatial resolution is extremely time-consuming and expensive with their estimation from a single optical image being an ill-possed problem. To overcome these limitations, this letter presents a new unpaired approach to obtain DSMs from optical images using deep learning techniques. Specifically, our new deep neural model is based on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform image-to-image translation, obtaining DSMs from optical images. Our newly proposed method has been tested in terms of photographic interpretation, reconstruction error, and classification accuracy using three well-known remotely sensed data sets with very high spatial resolution (obtained over Potsdam, Vaihingen, and Stockholm). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains satisfactory reconstruction rates that allow enhancing the classification results for these images. The source code of our method is available from: https://github.com/mhaut/UIMG2DSM.

TI  - Melanoma: Staging and Follow-Up
T2  - DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL & CONCEPTUAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer staging is the process determining to which extent a cancer has spread and where it is located in the body. A thorough staging is of utmost importance, not only because it provides the most accurate prognostic estimation, but also because several crucial decisions, such as the treatment choice and the follow-up strategy, vary according to the tumor's stage. The current staging system for melanoma is based on the 8th edition of TNM classification issued by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) in 2017. It includes a clinical and a pathological staging, both consisting of 5 stages (0-IV). The stage of a melanoma is determined by several factors, among which the Breslow thickness, the pathological presence or absence of ulceration in the primary tumor, the presence and the number of tumor-involved regional lymph nodes, the presence or absence of in-transit, satellite and/or microsatellite metastases, and the presence of distant metastases. Following melanoma diagnosis, an accurate medical workup, in line with the stage and the physical examination, should be performed.A -continuous patient monitoring is fundamental to detect a potential relapse or a second primary melanoma and should be lifelong. However, there is still no universally adopted follow-up strategy program and different follow-up schemes have been suggested. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate different follow-up protocols according to the adopted therapy, as novel recent therapies (targeted and immunotherapies) are being increasingly used.

T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with silicone breast implants who underwent excision of an abdominal melanoma and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Two lymph nodes were excised; both lying in the breast parenchyma adjacent to the intact right breast capsule. The lymph node histology revealed a subcapsular melanoma deposit along with silicone lymphadenopathy in the sentinel node. This case highlights that sentinel lymph nodes can be located in alternative locations to the common lymphatic basins and, therefore, the importance of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. We also discuss subclinical breast implant rupture as a causative factor for silicone lymphadenopathy.

TI  - Cold Wave-Induced Reductions in NDII and ChlRE for North-Western Pacific Mangroves Varies with Latitude and Climate History
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests growing at the poleward edges of their geographic distribution are occasionally subject to freezing (<0 degrees C) and cold wave (>0 degrees C) events. Cold wave effects on mangrove trees are well documented and adaptation to cold stress has been reported for local mangrove populations in the North Atlantic. However, there is less understanding of effects of cold waves on mangroves in the northern Pacific, especially at the regional scale. Moreover, it is unclear if cold tolerant mangrove species of North Asia display variation in resistance to cold temperatures across their geographic distribution. Using a cold wave event that occurred in January 2021, we evaluated the effects of low temperatures on vegetation index (VI) change (relative to a recent five-year baseline) for mangrove forests dominated by Kandelia obovata (Rhizophoraceae) and Avicennia marina (Acanthaceaee) at the northern edge of their geographical range. We used two VIs derived from Sentinel-2 imagery as indicators for canopy health: the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and the chlorophyll red-edge index (ChlRE), which reflect forest canopy water content and chlorophyll concentration, respectively. We isolated the cold wave effects on the forest canopy from phenology (i.e., cold wave induced deviation from a five-year baseline) and used multiple linear regression to identify significant climatic predictors for the response of mangrove forest canopy VI change to low temperatures. For areas where the cold wave resulted in temperatures <10 degrees C, immediate decreases in both VIs were observed, and the VI difference relative to the baseline was generally greater at 30-days after the cold wave than when temperatures initially recovered to baseline values, showing a slight delay in VI response to cold wave-induced canopy damage. Furthermore, the two VIs did not respond consistently suggesting that cold-temperature induced changes in mangrove canopy chlorophyll and water content are affected independently or subject to differing physiological controls. Our results confirm that local baseline (i.e., recent past) climate predicts canopy resistance to cold wave damage across K. obovata stands in the northern Pacific, and in congruence with findings from New World mangroves, they imply geographic variation in mangrove leaf physiological resistance to cold for Northern Pacific mangroves.

TI  - Application of SWAT Using Snow Data and Detecting Climate Change Impacts in the Mountainous Eastern Regions of Turkey
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and the hydrologic cycle have gained importance especially for snow-dominated mountainous basins. Within this scope, the Euphrates-Tigris Basin, a snow-fed transboundary river with several large dams, was selected to investigate the effects of changing climate on seasonal snow and runoff. In this study, two headwater basins of the Euphrates River, ranging in elevation between 1500-3500 m, were assigned and SWAT was employed as a hydrological modeling tool. Model calibration and validation were conducted in a stepwise manner for snow and runoff consecutively. For the snow routine, model parameters were adjusted using MODIS daily snow-covered area, achieving hit rates of more than 95% between MODIS and SWAT. Other model parameters were calibrated successively and later validated according to daily runoff, reaching a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.64-0.82 in both basins. After the modeling stage, the focus was drawn to the impacts of climate change under two different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in two 30-year projection periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2099). From the results, it is estimated that on average snow water equivalent decreases in the order of 30-39% and snow-covered days shorten by 37-43 days for the two basins until 2099. In terms of runoff, a slight reduction of at most 5% on average volume is projected but more notably, runoff center-time is expected to shift 1-2 weeks earlier by the end of the century.

TI  - Feasibility and Oncological Safety of Axillary Reverse Mapping in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer and Partial Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) aims to identify and preserve arm drainage in order to prevent lymphedema following axillary lymph node dissection. Oncological-safety and feasibility are still debated, especially in patients with locally-advanced breast cancer (LABC). We report the first case of the AXMAP 1.0 study performed in our Institution. Patients and Methods: A 52-year-old patient with a triple-negative LABC and partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy underwent axillary lymph-node dissection using fluorescence ARM. Results: Two lymph-nodes draining the ipsilateral upper arm were identified and were not preserved due to suspicion of malignancy. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of malignancy in both lymph nodes. Conclusion: Further studies should be designed in order to validate the oncological safety of this technique, especially in patients with LABC requiring neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Observations of Winter Ablation on Glaciers in the Mount Everest Region in 2020-2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent observations of rising snow lines and reduced snow-covered areas on glaciers during the October 2020-January 2021 period in the Nepal-China region of Mount Everest in Landsat and Sentinel imagery highlight observations that significant ablation has occurred in recent years on many Himalayan glaciers in the post-monsoon and early winter periods. For the first time, we now have weather stations providing real-time data in the Mount Everest region that may sufficiently transect the post-monsoon snow line elevation region. These sensors have been placed by the Rolex National Geographic Perpetual Planet expedition. Combining in situ weather records and remote sensing data provides a unique opportunity to examine the impact of the warm and dry conditions during the 2020 post-monsoon period through to the 2020/2021 winter on glaciers in the Mount Everest region. The ablation season extended through January 2021. Winter (DJF) ERA5 reanalysis temperature reconstructions for Everest Base Camp (5315 m) for the 1950-February 2021 period indicate that six days in the January 10-15 period in 2021 fell in the top 1% of all winter days since 1950, with January 13, January 14, and January 12, being the first, second, and third warmest winter days in the 72-year period. This has also led to the highest freezing levels in winter for the 1950-2021 period, with the January 12-14 period being the only period in winter with a freezing level above 6000 m.

TI  - SemiCDNet: A Semisupervised Convolutional Neural Network for Change Detection in High Resolution Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) is one of the main applications of remote sensing. With the increasing popularity of deep learning, most recent developments of CD methods have introduced the use of deep learning techniques to increase the accuracy and automation level over traditional methods. However, when using supervised CD methods, a large amount of labeled data is needed to train deep convolutional networks with millions of parameters. These labeled data are difficult to acquire for CD tasks. To address this limitation, a novel semisupervised convolutional network for CD (SemiCDNet) is proposed based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). First, both the labeled data and unlabeled data are input into the segmentation network to produce initial predictions and entropy maps. Then, to exploit the potential of unlabeled data, two discriminators are adopted to enforce the feature distribution consistency of segmentation maps and entropy maps between the labeled and unlabeled data. During the competitive training, the generator is continuously regularized by utilizing the unlabeled information, thus improving its generalization capability. The effectiveness and reliability of our proposed method are verified on two high-resolution remote sensing data sets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Reflectance Fusion via Tensor Sparse Representation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tradeoffs between the spatial and temporal resolutions of current satellite instruments limit our ability to conduct high-quality and continuous monitoring of the earth's surface dynamics. Spatiotemporal image fusion has become increasingly necessary to obtain remote sensing images with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, current learning-based methods concentrate on predicting images only from spatial similarity and neglect spectral correlations of remote sensing images, leading to significant spectral information loss. In this article, we develop a novel nonlocal tensor sparse representation-based semicoupled dictionary learning approach (SCDNTSR) for spatiotemporal fusion. In the SCDNTSR method, the spectral correlation and the spatial similarity of the nonlocal similar cubes are simultaneously exploited through the tensor-tensor product-based tensor sparse representation. Furthermore, the semicoupled mapping prior knowledge of sparse coefficients across the high- and low-spatial resolution (HSR\backslashLSR) image spaces is exploited with the coupled dictionary to constrain the similarity of sparse coefficients to improve the prediction performance. In addition, to capture additional prior spatial information, the SCDNTSR provides a new method to determine the degradation relationship between the target HSR and LSR difference images with the help of the known HSR and LSR difference images. The proposed SCDNTSR method was tested on real datasets at both the Coleambally Irrigation Area study site and the Lower Gwydir Catchment study site. Results show that the proposed method outperforms five state-of-the-art methods, especially in maintaining the spectral information, proving the feasibility of integrating the degradation relationship, spatio-spectral-nonlocal correlation, and semicoupled mapping priors of the multisource data into the proposed model.

TI  - Water Mixing Conditions Influence Sentinel-2 Monitoring of Chlorophyll Content in Monomictic Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prompt estimation of phytoplankton biomass is critical in determining the ecological quality of freshwaters. Remote Sensing (RS) may provide new opportunities to integrate with situ traditional monitoring techniques. Nonetheless, wide regional and temporal variability in freshwater optical constituents makes it difficult to design universally applicable RS protocols. Here, we assessed the potential of two neural networks-based models, namely the Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor and the Mixture Density Network (MDN), applied to MSI Sentinel-2 data for monitoring Chlorophyll (Chl) content in three monomictic volcanic lakes while accounting for the effect of their specific water circulation pattern on the remotely-sensed and in situ data relation. Linear mixed models were used to test the relationship between the remote sensing indices calculated through C2RCC (I-NN) and MDN (I-MDN), and in situ Chl concentration. Both indices proved to explain a large portion of the variability in the field data and exhibited a positive and significant relationship between Chl concentration and satellite data, but only during the mixing phase. The significant effect of the water circulation period can be explained by the low responsiveness of the RS approaches applied here to the low phytoplankton biomass, typical of the stratification phase. Sentinel-2 data proved their valuable potential for the remote sensing of phytoplankton in small inland water bodies, otherwise challenging with previous sensors. However, caution should be taken, since the applicability of such an approach on certain water bodies may depend on hydrological and ecological parameters (e.g., thermal stratification and seasonal nutrient availability) potentially altering RS chlorophyll detection by neural networks-based models, despite their alleged global validity.

TI  - Assessment of land use change and crop water requirements in Dong Hung district in the Red River Delta of Vietnam using GIS and satellite imageries
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land use changes plays crucial role for the management and use of land in a reasonable and effective manner. As land use change is associated with increasingly dynamic socio-economic activities, tracking land use change becomes more difficult with larger amounts of data to be processed. In this study, the modern technology of GIS and Remote Sensing was applied for the assessment of land use change and crop water requirements in Dong Hung district in the Red River Delta of Vietnam. Databases of land use for 2013 and 2018 comprising 2492 and 3473 land parcels with 32 and 36 land use types, respectively, were built from land use map and land use status report. The databases were then used to construct a database of land use change for the period of 2013-2018, which was finally used for land use change assessment. In addition, Landsat-8 OLI data was used to detect land use change for Summer-Autumn and Winter-Spring seasons of 2013 and 2018. Moreover, MODIS satellite data was also used to estimate the crop water requirements for the rice fields for the mentioned seasons in the district. The study revealed that there was a complicated conversion among land use types, but in general agricultural land decreased by 485.9 ha, while non-agricultural land increased by 493.23 ha mainly with the expansion of residential land and land for infrastructure development. Among agricultural land use types, however, only annual cropland, which mostly includes paddy land was narrowed down by nearly 770ha, meanwhile other agricultural land increased. Crop water requirement was found to change slightly during the study period. Although the changes in land use in the study area imply the progress of urbanization, infrastructure improvement and economic restructuring, since Thai Binh province is the heart of the Red River Delta and critically contributes to the rice production in the region, the decline in paddy land is of great concern that should be taken into account for land management and planning of the province and the district.

TI  - THE TAMED DEATH IN THE POETIC WORK OF EFRAIN BARQUERO
T2  - ACTA LITERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the various themes addressed by the poetic work of Efrain Barquero, this article focuses on Barquero's metaphysical perspective systematized by the poet in the selected works analyzed here. This Barquerian poetic metaphysics is configured as the ancestral unification of the living and the dead, where the latter activate their presence in the texts as ghosts, or spectral figures. This prosopoeic reformulation of death, a result of a pantheistic worldview, avoids the postulation of a transcendent faith, and instead of it relies on an immanence that only affects the speaker's clan of ancestors in the early works of Barquero. In his latest works this particular situation assumes a universal dimension. The reading hypothesis, which proposes an epistemic reworking about death in Barquero, is justified as a result of the theoretical combination of poetic rationality established by Maria Zambrano and the founding character that Gianni Vattimo gives to poetry, together with the resemantization of the death posed by Emmanuel Levinas.

TI  - Transport Infrastructure SHM Using Integrated SAR Data and On-Site Vibrational Acquisitions: "Ponte Della Musica-Armando Trovajoli" Case Study
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the first results obtained by applying in situ and remote-sensing methodologies to monitor the Ponte della Musica-Armando Trovajoli located in Rome, within the activities of the WP6 "Structural Health Monitoring and Satellite Data" 2019-21 Reluis Project. In particular, the use of remote-sensing Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (DInSAR) measurements provided a spatial map of the displacement of the investigated infrastructure and the corresponding time-series, with the aim of monitoring deformation phenomena, focusing on the local scale analysis, which produces suitable results for urban monitoring and damage assessment. The DInSAR results have been integrated with the identification of the dynamic characteristics of the bridge, performed through an experimental campaign of ambient vibration measurements carried out in October 2020 and with the local-scale definition of the engineering geological setting of the foundation soil. The subsoil of the bridge is constituted by more than 50 m of recent alluvial deposits resting on Pliocene stiff clay acting as a geological bedrock. A substantially stable behavior of the bridge structural elements has been observed based on the analysis of both satellite and velocimetric data. This case represents a good example about how the integration of in situ sensors with remotely sensed data and the exploitation of a detailed knowledge regarding the on-site conditions represent a key factor for a sustainable structural and infrastructural monitoring and can support the planning both of maintenance and safety management.

TI  - Evaluating Irrigation Performance and Water Productivity Using EEFlux ET and NDVI
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern California's Imperial Valley (IV) faces serious water management concerns due to its semi-arid environment, water-intensive crops and limited water supply. Accurate and reliable irrigation system performance and water productivity information is required in order to assess and improve the current water management strategies. This study evaluates the spatially distributed irrigation equity, adequacy and crop water productivity (CWP) for two water-intensive crops, alfalfa and sugar beet, using remotely sensed data and a geographical information system for the 2018/2019 crop growing season. The actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) was mapped in Google Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux, using the linear interpolation method in R version 4.0.2. The approx() function in the base R was used to produce daily ETa maps, and then totaled to compute the ETa for the whole season. The equity and adequacy were determined according to the ETa's coefficient of variation (CV) and relative evapotranspiration (RET), respectively. The crop classification was performed using a machine learning approach (a random forest algorithm). The CWP was computed as a ratio of the crop yield to the crop water use, employing yield disaggregation to map the crop yield, using county-level production statistics data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. The relative errors (RE) of the ETa compared to the reported literature values were 7-27% for alfalfa and 0-3% for sugar beet. The average ETa variation was low; however, the spatial variation within the fields showed that 35% had a variability greater than 10%. The RET was high, indicating adequate irrigation; 31.5% of the alfalfa and 12% of the sugar beet fields clustered in the Valley's central corner were consuming more water than their potential visibly. The CWP showed wide variation, with CVs of 32.92% for alfalfa and 25.4% for sugar beet, signifying a substantial scope for CWP enhancement. The correlation between the CWP, ETa and yield showed that reducing the ETa to approximately 1500 mm for alfalfa and 1200 mm for sugar beet would help boost the CWP without decreasing the yield, which is nearly equivalent to 44.52M cu. m (36,000 acre-ft) of water. The study's results could help water managers to identify poorly performing fields where water conservation and management could be focused.

TI  - A Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study of Epistasis Effects of Production Traits and Daughter Pregnancy Rate in US Holstein Cattle
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Epistasis is widely considered important, but epistasis studies lag those of SNP effects. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 76,109 SNPs and 294,079 first-lactation Holstein cows was conducted for testing pairwise epistasis effects of five production traits and three fertility traits: milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat percentage (FPC), protein percentage (PPC), and daughter pregnancy rate (DPR). Among the top 50,000 pairwise epistasis effects of each trait, the five production traits had large chromosome regions with intra-chromosome epistasis. The percentage of inter-chromosome epistasis effects was 1.9% for FPC, 1.6% for PPC, 10.6% for MY, 29.9% for FY, 39.3% for PY, and 84.2% for DPR. Of the 50,000 epistasis effects, the number of significant effects with log10(1/p) >= 12 was 50,000 for FPC and PPC, and 10,508, 4763, 4637 and 1 for MY, FY, PY and DPR, respectively, and A x A effects were the most frequent epistasis effects for all traits. Majority of the inter-chromosome epistasis effects of FPC across all chromosomes involved a Chr14 region containing DGAT1, indicating a potential regulatory role of this Chr14 region affecting all chromosomes for FPC. The epistasis results provided new understanding about the genetic mechanism underlying quantitative traits in Holstein cattle.

TI  - Modelling transitions in sealed surface cover fraction with Quantitative State Cellular Automata
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cellular Automata (CA) applications simulating urban processes generally employ discrete land-use classes to characterise the physical environment. Yet there is an increasing demand for urban land cover models simulating quantitative change at the sub-cell level. The proposed Quantitative State Cellular Automata model (QCA) addresses this issue by relaxing part of the CA definition and considering real-valued quantitative cell states reflecting a physically meaningful measure. QCA entails two components of change: transition potential and quantity of change. The potential component addresses the likelihood of any change occurring in a cell, whereas the quantity component estimates the magnitude of change. The QCA concept is illustrated for Sealed Surface Density (SSD) transitions in Brussels and part of Flanders (Belgium). A Mutual Information (MI) approach is used to define the neighbourhood interaction framework. The QCA model is respectively calibrated and validated using Landsat-derived 1987?2001 and 2001?2013 SSD change on 30 m resolution. The results show that QCA successfully emulates spatial patterns of urban development, and significantly outperforms a random model in terms of quantitative and spatial distribution of SSD change. Further improvements can be achieved by explicitly integrating socio-economic information in the proposed workflow.

TI  - Extracting Information on Rocky Desertification from Satellite Images: A Comparative Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rocky desertification occurs in many karst terrains of the world and poses major challenges for regional sustainable development. Remotely sensed data can provide important information on rocky desertification. In this study, three common open-access satellite image datasets (Sentinel-2B, Landsat-8, and Gaofen-6) were used for extracting information on rocky desertification in a typical karst region (Guangnan County, Yunnan) of southwest China, using three machine-learning algorithms implemented in the Python programming language: random forest (RF), bagged decision tree (BDT), and extremely randomized trees (ERT). Comparative analyses of the three data sources and three algorithms show that: (1) The Sentinel-2B image has the best capability for extracting rocky desertification information, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 85.21% using the ERT method. This can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2B image than that of Landsat-8 and Gaofen-6 images and Gaofen-6's lack of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands suitable for mapping carbonate rocks. (2) The ERT method has the best classification results of rocky desertification. Compared with the RF and BDT methods, the ERT method has stronger randomness in modeling and can effectively identify important feature factors for extracting information on rocky desertification. (3) The combination of the Sentinel-2B images and the ERT method provides an effective, efficient, and free approach to information extraction for mapping rocky desertification. The study can provide a useful reference for effective mapping of rocky desertification in similar karst environments of the world, in terms of both satellite image sources and classification algorithms. It also provides important information on the total area and spatial distribution of different levels of rocky desertification in the study area to support decision making by local governments for sustainable development.

TI  - Investigating forest fragmentation through earth observation datasets and metric analysis in the tropical rainforest area
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive mining operations, deforestation, jhumming, and soil erosion coupled with population stress in the study area have put an adverse effect on its forest resources. This study investigates the transition in forest cover classes and its fragmentation in the Jaintia Hills District of Meghalaya (India). Satellite data (multispectral images from Landsat 5 and 8) for 1995, 2001, 2007, and 2015 were classified using the supervised classification method. Landscape metrics from the classified images were calculated using FRAGSTATS. The overall accuracy of classification was found to be 87.50% (1995), 87.50% (2001), 85.00% (2007) and 91.67% (2015), respectively. The results revealed an increase in dense forest with an increase in the patch number from 1995 to 2007. Additionally, a decrease in non-forest cover with an increase in the number of patches from 2001 to 2015 was observed which further suggests fragmentation. It has been reported that 8.13% of the dense forest increased and 19.47% of non-forested areas decreased during the study period. Overall, this study highlights the changes in the distribution of forest area which could aid policy makers to adopt appropriate forest conservation strategies.

TI  - Additional Reference Height Error Analysis for Baseline Calibration Based on a Distributed Target DEM in TwinSAR-L
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, additional reference height errors, caused by the penetration depth and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) decorrelation in desert regions in L-band spaceborne bistatic interferemetric SAR, will introduce significant errors in nowadays baseline calibration method based on distributed target and consequent DEM products. To quantify these two errrors, this paper takes the TwinSAR-L mission as an example, gives an introduction of TwinSAR-L, outlines the theoretical baseline accuracy requirements that need to be satisfied in the TwinSAR-L mission and addresses the additional reference height errors caused by the penetration depth and SNR decorrelation in desert regions in general by taking the TwinSAR-L mission as an example. Based on ALOS-2 data from a dry desert region in the east of Xing Jiang, this paper quantitatively analyzes these additional reference height errors. The results show that the additional reference height errors resulted from the penetration depth and the SNR decorrelation are 1.295 m and 1.39 m, respectively, which would even cause 6.4 mm and 8.6 mm baseline calibration errors. These errors would seriously degrade the baseline calibration accuracy and the consequent DEM product quality. Therefore, our analysis is of great significance not only for baseline calibration, but also for high-quality DEM's generation, accuracy assessment and geophysical parameters' quantitative inversion and application.

TI  - Urban Heat Islands and Vulnerable Populations in a Mid-Size Coastal City in an Arid Environment
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arica is a coastal city located in northern Chile, in the Atacama Desert. The behavior of surface temperatures in the city between 1985 and 2019 was studied using Landsat satellite images, leading to the identification of surface urban heat islands (SUHI), surface urban cold islands (SUCI), and average temperature zones. The higher intensities of the SUHI reach values of almost 45 degrees C and the SUCI lower values are below 13 degrees C. From the socioeconomic characterisation of the population based on indicators retrieved from the 2012 and 2017 population censuses, we identified that during the study period there was a lower presence of SUHI, but these were linked to spaces of lower socioeconomic level and, for the most part, would form new urban spaces within the city. On the other hand, SUCI had a greater spatial presence in the study area and in the urban morphology, being found mostly in areas of high socioeconomic level and in consolidated spaces with few possibilities of generating new constructions.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance of vaccine-associated adverse events in US emergency departments
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explored use of emergency department (ED) visit data, during 2018-2020, from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program to monitor vaccine-associated adverse events (VAE) among all age groups. A combination of chief complaint terms and administrative diagnosis codes were used to detect VAE-related ED visits. Postvaccination fever was among the top 10 most frequently noted diagnoses. VAE annual trends demonstrated seasonality; visits trended upward starting in September of each year, coinciding with the administration of seasonal influenza vaccines. The 2020 VAE-related visit trend declined below the 2018 and 2019 baselines during March 22- September 5, 2020, before returning to the seasonal pattern. VAE-related visits declined in children aged 3-18 years in 2020 compared with 2018-2019, especially in the back-to-school months. These findings demonstrate that syndromic surveillance can complement traditional VAE reporting systems without an additional demand on data collection resources. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Discovering Intra-Urban Population Movement Pattern Using Taxis' Origin and Destination Data and Modeling the Parameters Affecting Population Distribution
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - GPS-equipped vehicles are an effective approach for acquiring urban population movement patterns. Attempts have been made in the present study in order to identify the population displacement pattern of the study region using taxis' origin and destination data, and then model the parameters affecting the population displacement pattern and provide an ultimate model in order to predict pick-up and drop-off locations. In this way, the passenger pick-up and drop-off locations have been identified in order to obtain the population movement pattern. In this study, Moran's I index was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation, and hot spot analysis was used to analyze spatial patterns of pick-up and drop-off locations. Effective parameters modeling was performed using the Poisson regression. The results of the spatiotemporal distribution map for pick-up and drop-off locations indicated a similarity in patterns and equal results for some locations. Results also indicated different features of spatial distribution during different hours of the day. Spatial autocorrelation analysis results indicated a low probability of randomness in the general spatial distribution of the locations. The result of modeling the parameters shows the positive effect of the parameters on the pattern of population movement, and according to the p-value of 0.000, Poisson regression is significant for the pick-up and drop-off locations. The modeling results also highlighted the importance of movement patterns in recognizing urban hot spots, which is valuable for policymakers and urban planners.

TI  - Scale of oceanic eddy killing by wind from global satellite observations
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind is the primary driver of the oceanic general circulation, yet the length scales at which this energy transfer occurs are unknown. Using satellite data and a recent method to disentangle multiscale processes, we find that wind deposits kinetic energy into the geostrophic ocean flow only at scales larger than 260 km, on a global average. We show that wind removes energy from scales smaller than 260 km at an average rate of -50 GW, a process known as eddy killing. To our knowledge, this is the first objective determination of the global eddy killing scale. We find that eddy killing is taking place at almost all times but with seasonal variability, peaking in winter, and it removes a substantial fraction (up to 90%) of the wind power input in western boundary currents. This process, often overlooked in analyses and models, is a major dissipation pathway for mesoscales, the ocean's most energetic scales.

TI  - Mapping of Sicilian Pocket Beaches Land Use/Land Cover with Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Case Study of Messina Province
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Pocket beaches (PBs) are among the most attractive tourist sites and economic development contributors in coastal areas; however, they are negatively impacted by the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Generally, research on PBs is conducted from the beach towards offshore. Studies on the land use/land cover (LULC) of PBs are limited and currently lacking. Such studies deserve more investigation due to the importance of LULC in PBs' functioning. In this study, supervised classification methods were investigated for LULC mapping of the PBs located in the province of Messina. Sentinel-2B satellite images were analyzed using maximum likelihood (MaL), minimum distance (MiD), mahalanobis distance (MaD) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification methods. The study was conducted mainly in order to determine which classification method would be adequate for small scale Sentinel-2 imagery analysis and provide accurate results for the LULC mapping of PBs. In addition, an occurrence-based filter algorithm in conjunction with OpenStreetMap data and Google Earth imagery was used to extract linear features within 500 m of the inland buffer zone of the PBs. The results demonstrate that information on the biophysical parameters, namely surface cover fractions, of the coastal area can be obtained by conducting LULC mapping on Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Caution Is Needed When Using Niche Models to Infer Changes in Species Abundance: The Case of Two Sympatric Raptor Populations
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This study focuses on sympatric populations of hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) breeding in mountain heathlands in the NW Iberian Peninsula. These populations have been affected by habitat loss caused by land-use change. Despite the mounting evidence supporting positive relationships between species abundance and habitat suitability, the capacity of ecological niche models to capture variations in population abundance remains largely unexplored. This study shows that habitat suitability predicted from niche models was significantly correlated with the relative abundance for hen harrier and, to a lesser extent, for Montagu's harrier. However, the temporal variation in local population abundance was not significantly explained by habitat suitability changes predicted by the niche models. These findings call for caution in the use of niche models to infer changes in population abundance. The positive relationship between species abundance and habitat suitability supports the use of niche models to estimate abundance but does not guarantee the ability of these models to predict temporal variations in species abundance. These findings highlight (1) the need to include other possible biotic or abiotic factors involved in population abundance dynamics into niche models and (2) the need to establish specific monitoring protocols for tracking population dynamics. Despite the mounting evidence supporting positive relationships between species abundance and habitat suitability, the capacity of ecological niche models (ENMs) to capture variations in population abundance remains largely unexplored. This study focuses on sympatric populations of hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), surveyed in 1997 and 2017 in an upland moor area in northwestern Spain. The ENMs performed very well for both species (with area under the ROC curve and true skill statistic values of up to 0.9 and 0.75). The presence of both species was mainly correlated with heathlands, although the normalized difference water index derived from Landsat images was the most important for hen harrier, indicating a greater preference of this species for wet heaths and peat bogs. The findings showed that ENM-derived habitat suitability was significantly correlated with the species abundance, thus reinforcing the use of ENMs as a proxy for species abundance. However, the temporal variation in species abundance was not significantly explained by changes in habitat suitability predicted by the ENMs, indicating the need for caution when using these types of models to infer changes in population abundance.

We generated seasonal displacement maps using DInSAR with ultrafine-beam Radarsat-2 data for the summers of 2013, 2015, and 2019 at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, and examined them in combination with a land-cover classification, meteorological data, topographic data, optical satellite imagery, and in situ measures of soil moisture, soil temperature, and depth to the frost table. Over the three years studied, displacement magnitudes (estimated uncertainty +/- 1 cm) of up to 10 cm per 48-day DInSAR stack were detected. However, generally, the displacement was far smaller (up to 4 cm). Surface displacement was found to be most extensive and of the greatest magnitude in low-lying, wet, and steeply sloping areas. The few areas where large vertical displacements (>2.5 cm) were detected in multiple years were clustered in wet, low lying areas, on steep slopes or ridges, or close to the coast. DInSAR also captured the expansion of two medium-sized retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), exhibiting widespread negative surface change in the slump floor.

TI  - THE WAY FOR WARD: LIFE AND LEARNING STORIES IN THE SOCIAL EDUCATOR'S PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL FORMATION
T2  - ECCOS-REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is about a partial cut of the Education doctoral thesis, in progress, that investigates the subjective constitution of social educators from their life stories and learning. In this reflexive effort, is it proposed to generate intelligibility on how social educator is constituted from his life stories and learning? From the inspiration in the methodology of Life History, we investigated the trajectories of a social educator and his relationships with professional and personal aspects, seeking to understand how the learning processes are part of his constitution as a teacher and social educator. The theoretical bases of the investigation refer to: Social Pedagogy, in a critical perspective; Theory of Subjectivity; Historical-cultural Psychology; and psycho pedagogical theories. The analysis of the empirical material was carried out from the Discursive Textual Analysis and the partial results are: a) the relation with his first teachers contributed significantly to the educator's constitution, as well as the relation with the African religion and the place that knowledge occupies in his worldview; b) negative experiences in school influenced his life learning processes - with family, friends, and social educators - to become central in the subjective constitution of him; c) the relationship with music and the role as a social educator had a strong participation in his personal constitution, as a person who learns and teaches.

TI  - Dermoscopic Predictors of Tumor Thickness in Cutaneous Melanoma: A Retrospective Analysis of 245 Melanomas
T2  - DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL & CONCEPTUAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The literature regarding the association of dermoscopic structures with Breslow thickness in melanoma is scarce, limited to small case series, and mostly outdated.Objective: This study determined the dermoscopic patterns, colors and structures that are associated with melanoma in situ, thin melanomas (<0.8 mm) and thick melanomas potentially requiring sentinel lymph node biopsy according to current guidelines (>= 0.8 mm).Methods: A retrospective evaluation of 245 dermoscopic images of primary cutaneous melanoma located on the trunk or limbs was performed by consensus of 2 dermoscopists.Results: Red-pink, blue-gray and white color, blue-white veil, shiny white streaks, irregular vessels, blue-black pigmentation, milky red areas, pseudolacunae, ulceration and rainbow pattern were associated with thickness >= 0.8 mm, whereas atypical pigmented network, regression and hypopigmented areas were significantly associated with early melanomas.Limitations: This is a retrospective study performed in a single institution. Melanomas of special sites were excluded from our evaluation. Dermoscopy is based on subjective evaluations that depend largely on the observers' experience.Conclusions: The identification of certain dermoscopic structures and colors might help in the discrimination between thin and thick melanomas.

TI  - Firefly® System and Organ Transillumination in Robotic Gynecologic Surgery
T2  - JSLS-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) of the Firefly (R) system has become a useful and widespread technique for the visualization and detection of tumors, sentinel lymphnodes, and vascular/anatomical structures.Methods: Between February 1, 2017 to September 30, 2019, a total of 25 patients affected by benign and malignant pathologies underwent robotic surgery by the use of organ transillumination with the concomitant Firefly (R). We analyzed the pre-operative patients' characteristics (age and body mass index previous abdominal surgeries and systemic disease); pre-operative diagnosis, surgical procedure and approach (multiport or single site), transilluminated organ, surgical outcomes (operating time, incidence of intraoperative complications, and incidence of conversion to other surgery); and postoperative outcome. The surgical procedures included: four bladder endometriosis nodules resections, one pelvic lymphadenectomy with ureterolysis, and 23 hysterectomies.Results: The average operating time was 283.3 (+/- 76.9) minutes, there were no intra-operative complications or laparotomic conversions. The average recovery days were 5.9. There have been three grade 2 post-surgical complications, following the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Surgical Secondary Events System classification. The combination of NIRF and transilluminition allows a dear view of the anatomical landmarks and the resection margins.Conclusions: It's likely that improvement in the anatomical detail could confer a greater surgical safety with lower percentage of intra and post-surgical complications and sparing of safe tissue. To evaluate the validity of these techniques in a larger number of patients and compare these new surgical procedures with standard ones, further studies are needed.

TI  - Environmental Controls of InSAR-Based Periglacial Ground Dynamics in a Sub-Arctic Landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Periglacial environments are characterized by highly dynamic landscapes. Freezing and thawing lead to ground movement, associated with cryoturbation and solifluction. These processes are sensitive to climate change and variably distributed depending on multiple environmental factors. In this study, we used multi-geometry Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to investigate the spatial distribution of the mean annual ground velocity in a mountainous landscape in Northern Norway. Statistical modeling was employed to examine how periglacial ground velocity is related to environmental variables characterizing the diverse climatic, geomorphic, hydrological and biological conditions within a 148 km(2) study area. Two-dimensional (2D) InSAR results document mean annual ground velocity up to 15 mm/yr. Vertical and horizontal velocity components in the East-West plane show variable spatial distribution, which can be explained by the characteristics of cryoturbation and solifluction operating differently over flat and sloping terrain. Statistical modeling shows that slope angle and mean annual air temperature variables are the most important environmental factors explaining the distribution of the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. Vegetation and snow cover also have a local influence, interpreted as indicators of the ground material and moisture conditions. The results show contrasted model performance depending on the velocity component used as a response variable. In general, our study highlights the potential of integrating radar remote sensing and statistical modeling to investigate mountainous regions and better understand the relations between environmental factors, periglacial processes and ground dynamics.

TI  - Mapping Sandy Areas and their changes using remote sensing. A Case Study at North-East Al-Muthanna Province, South of Iraq
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandy areas are the main problem in regions of arid and semi-arid climate in the world that threaten urban life, buildings, agricultural, and even human health. Remote sensing is one of the technologies that can be used as an effective tool in dynamic features study of sandy areas and sand accumulations. In this study, two new indices were developed to separate the sandy areas from the non-sandy areas. The first one is called the Normalized Differential Sandy Areas Index (NDSAI) that has been based on the assumption that the sandy area has the lowest water content (moisture) than the other land cover classes. The second other is called the Sandy Areas Surface Temperature index (SASTI) which was built on the assumption that the surface temperature of sandy soil is the highest. The results of proposed indices have been compared with two indices that were previously proposed by other researchers, namely the Normalized Differential Sand Dune Index NDSI and the Eolain Mapping Index (EMI). The accuracy assessment of the sandy indices showed that the NDSAI provides very good performance with an overall accuracy of 89 %. The SASTI can isolate many sandy and non-sandy pixels with an overall accuracy about 86 %. The performance of the NDSI is low with an overall accuracy about 82 %. It fails to classify or isolate the vegetation area from the sandy area and might have better performance in desert environments. The performing of NDSAI that is calculated with the SWIR1 band of the Landsat satellite is better than the performing of NDSI that is calculated with the SWIR2 band of the same satellite. EMI performance is less robust than other methods as it is not useful for extracting sandy surfaces in area with different land covers. Change detection techniques were used by comparing the areas of the sandy lands for the periods from 1987 to 2017. The results showed an increase in sandy areas over four decades. The percentage of this increase was about 20 % to 30 % during 2002 and 2017 compared to 1987.

TI  - Machine-Learning Classification of Soil Bulk Density in Salt Marsh Environments
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data from both in situ and satellite platforms in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR, 400-2500 nm) regions have been widely used to characterize and model soil properties in a direct, cost-effective, and rapid manner at different scales. In this study, we assess the performance of machine-learning algorithms including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machines (XGBoost), and support vector machines (SVM) to model salt marsh soil bulk density using multispectral remote-sensing data from the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) platform. To our knowledge, use of remote-sensing data for estimating salt marsh soil bulk density at the vegetation rooting zone has not been investigated before. Our study reveals that blue (band 1; 450-520 nm) and NIR (band 4; 770-900 nm) bands of Landsat-7 ETM+ ranked as the most important spectral features for bulk density prediction by XGBoost and RF, respectively. According to XGBoost, band 1 and band 4 had relative importance of around 41% and 39%, respectively. We tested two soil bulk density classes in order to differentiate salt marshes in terms of their capability to support vegetation that grows in either low (0.032 to 0.752 g/cm(3)) or high (0.752 g/cm(3) to 1.893 g/cm(3)) bulk density areas. XGBoost produced a higher classification accuracy (88%) compared to RF (87%) and SVM (86%), although discrepancies in accuracy between these models were small (<2%). XGBoost correctly classified 178 out of 186 soil samples labeled as low bulk density and 37 out of 62 soil samples labeled as high bulk density. We conclude that remote-sensing-based machine-learning models can be a valuable tool for ecologists and engineers to map the soil bulk density in wetlands to select suitable sites for effective restoration and successful re-establishment practices.

TI  - Trends in Vessel Atmospheric Emissions in the Central Mediterranean over the Last 10 Years and during the COVID-19 Outbreak
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Giordan Lighthouse, located on the island of Gozo in the Malta-Sicily Channel within the central Mediterranean region, is ideally located to study the primary sources of atmospheric pollution. A total of 10 years of data have been accumulated from the reactive gas and greenhouse gas detectors and the aerosol analyzers found at this Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) regional station. The data has been evaluated, resulting in trends in emissions from shipping recorded within the same region coming to the fore. The other source of emissions that was evident within the recorded data originated from Mt. Etna, located on the island of Sicily and representing the highest active volcano in Europe. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ship emissions on trace gases and aerosol background measurements at Giordan Lighthouse, including the putative influence of COVID-19 on the same emissions. The model used to evaluate ship emissions was the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM). From trace gas measurements at Giordan Lighthouse, a slowly decreasing trend in sulfur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was noted. To better understand the air quality results obtained, the STEAM model was fed, as an input, an Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset to describe the vessel activity in the area concerned. This study also investigates the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on marine traffic patterns within the area and any corresponding changes in the air quality. Such an analysis was carried out through the use of SENTINEL 5 data.

TI  - Immunoreactive Acellular Keratin in Sentinel Lymph Nodes From a Patient With Endometrioid Carcinoma of the Endometrium With Squamous Differentiation: A Case Report of a Potential Diagnostic Pitfall
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is gaining increasing acceptance as a less morbid way to assess lymph node status in patients with endometrial carcinoma, compared with full pelvic node dissection. The sentinel nodes are usually subjected to ultrastaging, with sections taken at multiple levels from each block and immunstaining for keratin performed, in order to detect micrometastses. We report a case of an 80-yr-old woman who underwent a right sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of surgery for clinically and radiologically apparent stage I endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The immunostains for AE1/AE3 performed on the 2 right pelvic sentinel lymph nodes were positive, corresponding to subcapsular acellular keratin on hematoxylin and eosin; however, carcinoma cells could not be identified on the hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Immunomarkers for Ber-EP4 and EMA, both of which were strongly expressed in the endometrial carcinoma cells, were negative on the nodal tissue, and we concluded that the sentinel lymph nodes were negative for metastatic carcinoma, despite the positive keratin immunostains. To our knowledge, this unusual finding is not described in the literature; recognition of this phenomenon and study of additional cases is warranted.

TI  - Some Specifics in Using Optical Properties of Soil Surface for Moisture Detection
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The research was aimed at the analysis of relationship between the soil surface spectral reflectance and the moisture content in soil samples as the basis for moisture detection based on remote sensing data. By the example of nine samples from the arable horizons of podzolized chernozem, gray forest and soddy-podzolic soils analyzed in laboratory, the relationship was assessed between the spectral reflectance of soil surface in the visible spectral band detected with the HandHeld-2 spectroradiometer and the moisture content in samples. It was found that changes in the soil moisture content induce synchronous changes in the integral reflection in the visible spectral band only in a rather narrow interval of moisture, being specific for different soils. Variation in soil moisture content beyond these intervals does not change the spectral reflectance of soil surface. The results obtained prove that most of the satellite survey data in the optical range register the dry state of open soil surface, though the arable horizon proper may be rather moist. These regularities should be taken into account when developing satellite techniques for prompt monitoring of soil moisture by the remote sensing data obtained within the optical range of electromagnetic waves.

TI  - Monitoring environmental and climate goals for European agriculture: User perspectives on the optimization of the Copernicus evolution offer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A vicious cycle exists between agricultural production and climate change, where agriculture is both a driver and a victim of the changing climate. While new and ambitious environmental and climate change-oriented goals are being introduced in Europe, the monitoring of these objectives is often jeopardized by a lack of technological means and a reliance on heavy administrative procedures. In particular, remote sensing technologies have the potential to significantly improve the monitoring of such goals but the characteristics of such missions should take into consideration the needs of users to guarantee return on investments and effective policy implementation. This study aims at identifying gaps in the current offer of Copernicus products for the monitoring of the agricultural sector through the elicitation of stakeholder requirements. The methodology is applied to the case study of Italy while the approach is scalable at European level. The elicitation process associates user needs to the European and national legislative framework to create a policy-oriented demand of Copernicus Earth Observation services. Results show the limitations faced by environmental managers in relation to the use of Remote Sensing technologies and the shortcomings associated with a purely technology driven approach to the development of satellite missions. Through the introduction of this flexible and user centred approach instead, this paper provides a clear overview of agro-environmental user requirements and represents the basis for the definition of an integrated agricultural service.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Syndrome Definition to Identify Suspected Nonfatal Heroin-Involved Overdoses Treated in Emergency Departments
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works closely with states and local jurisdictions that are leveraging data from syndromic surveillance systems to identify meaningful changes in overdose trends. CDC developed a suspected nonfatal heroin overdose syndrome definition for use with emergency department (ED) data to help monitor trends at the national, state, and local levels.Objective:This study assesses the percentage of true-positive unintentional and undetermined intent heroin-involved overdose (UUHOD) captured by this definition.Design/Setting:CDC applied the UUHOD definition to ED data available in CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Data were analyzed from 18 states that shared access to their syndromic data in NSSP with the CDC overdose morbidity team. Data were analyzed using queries and manual reviews to identify heroin overdose diagnosis codes and text describing chief complaint reasons for ED visits.Measures:The percentage of true-positive UUHOD was calculated as the number of true-positives divided by the number of total visits captured by the syndrome definition.Results:In total, 99 617 heroin overdose visits were identified by the syndrome definition. Among 95 323 visits identified as acute heroin-involved overdoses, based on reviews of chief complaint text and diagnosis codes, 967 (1.0%) were classified as possible intentional drug overdoses. Among all 99 617 visits, 94 356 (94.7%) were classified as true-positive UUHOD; 2226 (2.2%) and 3035 (3.0%) were classified as "no" and "maybe" UUHOD, respectively.Conclusion:Analysis of the CDC heroin overdose syndrome definition determined that nearly all visits were captured accurately for patients presenting to the ED for a suspected acute UUHOD. This definition will continue to be valuable for ongoing heroin overdose surveillance and epidemiologic analysis of heroin overdose patterns. CDC will evaluate possible definition refinements as new products and terms for heroin overdose emerge.

TI  - Accelerated sea ice loss in the Wandel Sea points to a change in the Arctic's Last Ice Area
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic Ocean's Wandel Sea is the easternmost sector of the Last Ice Area, where thick, old sea ice is expected to endure longer than elsewhere. Nevertheless, in August 2020 the area experienced record-low sea ice concentration. Here we use satellite data and sea ice model experiments to determine what caused this record sea ice minimum. In our simulations there was a multi-year sea-ice thinning trend due to climate change. Natural climate variability expressed as wind-forced ice advection and subsequent melt added to this trend. In spring 2020, the Wandel Sea had a mixture of both thin and-unusual for recent years-thick ice, but this thick ice was not sufficiently widespread to prevent the summer sea ice concentration minimum. With continued thinning, more frequent low summer sea ice events are expected. We suggest that the Last Ice Area, an important refuge for ice-dependent species, is less resilient to warming than previously thought. Arctic sea ice dynamics during August 2020 reveal that the Last Ice Area is more vulnerable to climate change and natural climate variability than previously thought, according to analyses of satellite data and sea ice model experiments.

AB  - Non-perennial rivers (N-PRs) make up two thirds of all rivers in South Africa, yet many are ungauged. Traditionally, it has been assumed that when a flow is recorded, there is water throughout that river. These assumptions have led to incorrect estimations of available water resources. This work thus aimed at developing a new spatially explicit framework, for monitoring river water availability in a N-PR system. The Tankwa River in South Africa was used for testing this approach. The length of the river reach with water was determined using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data derived indices. Image thresholding was applied to Sentinel-1, and the normalised difference water index (NDWI) to Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 yielded an overall accuracy (OA) of 85%, whereas Sentinel-1 yielded an OA of 38%. The analysed reach of the Tankwa River had an actual length of 9 244 m. Based on the performance of Sentinel-2 data, further analysis was undertaken using Sentinel images acquired during the months of February, May and July of 2016. The results indicated that the lengths of the reaches of inundated Tankwa River were 2 809 m, 3 202 m and 2 890 m, respectively. Overall, the findings of this study show that an estimated length of a river inundated by water can be determined using new-generation Sentinel data and these results provide new insights on the dynamics of N-PRs - a previously challenging task with broadband multispectral satellite datasets.

TI  - Burden of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in India based on data from cross-sectional serosurveys, 2017 and 2019-20
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background India has set a goal to eliminate measles and rubella/Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) by 2023. Towards this goal, India conducted nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with measles-rubella containing vaccine (MRCV) targeting children aged between 9 months to <15 years and established a hospital-based sentinel surveillance for CRS. Reliable data about incidence of CRS is necessary to monitor progress towards the elimination goal.Methods We conducted serosurveys in 2019-20 among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of 6 hospitals, which were also sentinel sites for CRS surveillance, to estimate the prevalence of IgG antibodies against rubella. We systematically sampled 1800 women attending antenatal clinics and tested their sera for IgG antibodies against rubella. We used rubella seroprevalence data from the current survey and the survey conducted in 2017 among antenatal women from another 6 CRS surveillance sites to construct a catalytic models to estimate the incidence and burden of CRS.Result The seroprevalence of rubella antibodies was 82.3% (95% CI: 80.4-84.0). Rubella seropositivity did not differ by age group and educational status. Based on the constant and age-dependent force of infection models, we estimated that the annual incidence of CRS in India was 225.58 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 217.49-232.41) and 65.47 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 41.60-104.16) respectively. This translated to an estimated 14,520 (95% CI: 9,225-23,100) and 50,028 (95% CI: 48,234-51,543) infants with CRS every year based on age-dependent and constant force of infection models respectively.Conclusions Our findings indicated that about one fifth of women in the reproductive age group in India were susceptible for rubella. The estimates of CRS incidence will serve as a baseline to monitor the impact of MRCV SIAs, as well progress towards the elimination goal of rubella/CRS.Author summary Rubella infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can affect fetus, resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or birth of a baby with a combination of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Vaccination with rubella containing vaccine (RCV) is recommended as one of the strategies for eliminating rubella/CRS. The Southeast Asia region has set a target to eliminate rubella/CRS by 2023. Towards this goal, India completed nationwide immunization campaigns using measles-rubella vaccine during 2017-19, targeting children aged 9 months to <15 years. A case-based surveillance for CRS was initiated in five sentinel hospitals (Phase-1) in 2016 and later expanded to additional 6 sites (Phase-2) in 2019, to estimate burden of CRS and monitor its trend. As an adjunct to CRS surveillance, periodic serologic surveys were also planned to monitor the rubella seroprevalence among the pregnant women. A serosurvey conducted in 2017 indicated that 83.4% pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Phase-1 sentinel hospitals had IgG antibodies against rubella. The second serosurvey conducted during 2019-20 in 6 Phase-2 sites indicated a comparable seroprevalence of 82.3%. Using seroprevalence data from these two serosurveys, we estimated that the annual incidence of CRS in India was 225.58 per 100,000 live births with constant force of infection and 65.47 per 100,000 live births with age-dependent force of infection model. This incidence rates translated to an estimated 14,520 to 50,028 infants with CRS every year. The estimates of CRS incidence will serve as a baseline to monitor the progress towards the elimination goal of rubella/CRS in India.

TI  - A Deep Learning Model for Forecasting Sea Surface Height Anomalies and Temperatures in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of forecasting oceanic variables has traditionally relied on numerical models, which effectively consider the ocean's dynamic evolution and are of physical importance. However, to make the models more realistic, complicated processes need to be considered, which is difficult because their calculations are complex. In fact, information on the internal dynamic mechanisms and external driving forces of the ocean are already embedded in the time series of observations. Therefore, we can determine the patterns of ocean variations through data mining of these series to achieve forecasting. Furthermore, to predict variations in ocean processes more realistically, interactions between variables and spatial correlations should be effectively considered. Thus, inspired by available remote sensing data and advancements in deep learning technologies, we develop a hybrid model based on a statistical method and a deep learning model to predict multiple sea surface variables. A case study in the South China Sea shows that this model is highly promising for short-term daily forecasts of the sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and sea surface temperature (SST). When the forecast time is 10 days, the root mean square errors of this model forecasts for SSHA and SST are approximately 0.0276 m and 0.46 degrees C, respectively, which are much smaller than those of persistence, climatology and linear regression predictions. The anomaly correlation coefficients for SSHA and SST are approximately 0.864 and 0.633, respectively. The model performs satisfactorily under both normal and typhoon weather conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of ECOSTRESS Thermal Data over South Florida Estuaries
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational coarse-resolution satellite thermal sensors designed for global oceans are often insufficient for evaluating surface temperature of small water bodies. Here, the quality of the thermal data, collected by the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), over several South Florida estuaries, Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Okeechobee is evaluated using both in situ and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. Overall, for SST between similar to 6 and similar to 32 degrees C, ECOSTRESS LST (Land Surface Temperature, used as a surrogate for SST in this study) appears to be slightly underestimated, with the underestimation being more severe at night (-1.13 degrees C) than during the day (-0.64 degrees C), in spring and summer (-1.25 +/- 1.39 degrees C) than in autumn and winter (-0.57 +/- 0.98 degrees C), and after May 2019 when two of the five bands failed. The root-mean-square uncertainties of ECOSTRESS SST are generally within 1-2 degrees C. Spatial analysis further suggests that ECOSTRESS SST covers waters closer to shore and reveals more spatial features than MODIS, with comparable image noise. From these observations, after proper georeferencing and empirical correction of the negative bias, ECOSTRESS SST may be used to evaluate the thermal environments of small water bodies, thus filling gaps in the coarse-resolution satellite data.

TI  - Assessing Hydrological Impact of Forested Area Change: A Remote Sensing Case Study
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between precipitation and vegetation plays a significant role in the formation of runoff, and it is still a widely discussed issue in hydrology. The difficulty lies in estimating the degree to which a forest influences runoff generation, especially flood peaks, on the one hand, due to the small amount of information regarding the evolution of the forest area and density, and, on the other hand, the correlations between these indicators and the runoff and precipitation values. The analysis focuses on a small basin in the mountain region of Romania, the upper basin of the Ruscova River located in northwestern Romania. In this river basin, there is no significant anthropic influence, other than the intense deforestation and reforestation actions. Using satellite images captured by Landsat missions 5, 7 and 8 for the period 1985-2019, the forest canopy density vegetation index was extracted. Using a gridded precipitation dataset, a hydrological model was calibrated based on three scenarios to assess the impact of forest vegetation on the runoff. Analysis of the results of these models conducted on scenarios allowed us to deduce a simple equation for estimating the influence of forest area on maximum river flows. The analysis showed that even small differences in the forest surface area exert an influence on the peak flow, varying between -5.28% and 8.09%.

TI  - Leo Tolstoy's moralizing in context of ethical and aesthetic synthesis
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the moralizing of Leo Tolstoy on the example of his theoretical ideas. The authors, examining their genesis, come to the conclusion that the writer formed his ideas under the influence of French enlighteners and sentimentalists, on the one hand, and absorbed the ethical dominant of Russian culture, on the other hand The article analyzes the idea of absolutizing good, which runs through Tolstoy's entire aesthetic theory as a leitmotif. As a result of the study of the aesthetic views of the writer, it is concluded that Tolstoy understood the role of art solely as a translation of feelings and a means of communication. The writer deprives art of its aura of mystery and does not recognize the latter as a source of aesthetic pleasure and spiritual enrichment. The article analyzes the worldview of the writer, reveals the influence on him of the experience acquired by Tolstoy in childhood and adolescence. Tolstoy's works of art and theoretical views are another example of the fact that the artist's worldview does not always coincide with his work.

TI  - The Role of FDG PET/CT to Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Nodes after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the diagnostic value of breast and axillary maximum standard uptake (SUVmax) values for predicting ypT0 and ypN0 separately.Study Design: A descriptive study.Place and Duration of Study: Department of Medical Oncology, Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, between May 2017 and September 2020.Methodology: Consecutive patients with operated breast cancer (BC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were evaluated. SUVmax on FDG-PET/CT after NAC at both primary tumour (postSUVmax-T) and axillary lymph nodes (postSUVmax-N) were assessed to predict the ypT0 and the ypN0, respectively.Results: Clinically meaningful correlation was detected between postSUVmax-N with ypN0 in patients with human epidermal receptor-positive (Her2+) and triple-negative (TN) BC (in Her2+ BC: r=0.596, p <0.001, in TN BC: r=0.782, p = 0.001). The postSUVmax-N predicted ypN0 with 90.5% positive predictive value (PPV) and 85.7% negative predictive value ( NPV) in patients with Her2+ and TN BC. The postSUVmax-T predicted ypT0 with 87.5% PPV and 100% NPV in patients with TN BC (AUC: 0.938, P <0.01)Conclusion: According to this study's findings, the FDG-PET/CT may be an alternative to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) to protect patients from axillary lymph node dissection when the expected FNR of the SNB is high in patients with Her+ and TN BC.

TI  - Exploitation of optical and SAR amplitude imagery for landslide identification: a case study from Sikkim, Northeast India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and mapping of landslides is one of the most important techniques used for reducing the impact of natural disasters especially in the Himalaya, owing to its high amount of tectonic deformation, seismicity, and unfavorable climatic conditions. Moreover, the northeastern part of the Himalaya, severely affected by landslides every monsoon, is poorly studied. The information on the inventories is inhomogeneous and lacking. In this context, satellite-based earth observation data, which has significantly advanced in the last decade and often serves as a potential source for data collection, monitoring, and damage assessment for disasters in a short time span, has been implemented. Keeping in mind the above framework, this study aims to exploit the potentials of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery for identifying new landslides in vegetated and hilly areas of the northeastern part of India. In order to assess the potentials of our data and methodology, a landslide event which occurred on 13 August 2016 13:30 h (IST) in North Sikkim, India, triggered due to rainfall has been explored in detail. The landslide also resulted in the formation of a lake, 2.2 km in length and 290 m in width. Difficulty in procurement of cloud-free datasets immediately after the event led us to the use of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data, to assess its potential for this purpose. It is observed that the potential of SAR amplitude imagery is limited to different aspects as per the sensor look direction during the mode of acquisition. Furthermore, the present study also incorporates a change detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of the Sudden Landslide Identification Product (SLIP) model to identify new landslides using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Overall, the results exhibit that integrated usage of both optical and SAR amplitude imagery may provide a plethora of information for identification and mapping of new landslides for damage assessment and early warning. All the above results combined together suggest this method for rapid identification of landslides in the Himalayan terrain with special emphasis on the northeastern part of the Himalaya. The automation of this method for future operational usage is also suggested.

TI  - Changes in Power Plant NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions over Northwest Greece Using a Data Assimilation Technique
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate the ability of a data assimilation technique and space-borne observations to quantify and monitor changes in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions over Northwestern Greece for the summers of 2018 and 2019. In this region, four lignite-burning power plants are located. The data assimilation technique, based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter method, is employed to combine space-borne atmospheric observations from the high spatial resolution Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and simulations using the LOTOS-EUROS Chemical Transport model. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service-Regional European emissions (CAMS-REG, version 4.2) inventory based on the year 2015 is used as the a priori emissions in the simulations. Surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from air quality stations operating in the region are compared with the model surface NO2 output using either the a priori (base run) or the a posteriori (assimilated run) NOx emissions. Relative to the a priori emissions, the assimilation suggests a strong decrease in concentrations for the station located near the largest power plant, by 80% in 2019 and by 67% in 2018. Concerning the estimated annual a posteriori NO x emissions, it was found that, for the pixels hosting the two largest power plants, the assimilated run results in emissions decreased by similar to 40-50% for 2018 compared to 2015, whereas a larger decrease, of similar to 70% for both power plants, was found for 2019, after assimilating the space-born observations. For the same power plants, the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) reports decreased emissions in 2018 and 2019 compared to 2015 (-35% and -38% in 2018, -62% and -72% in 2019), in good agreement with the estimated emissions. We further compare the a posteriori emissions to the reported energy production of the power plants during the summer of 2018 and 2019. Mean decreases of about -35% and-63% in NOx emissions are estimated for the two larger power plants in summer of 2018 and 2019, respectively, which are supported by similar decreases in the reported energy production of the power plants (similar to 30% and -70%, respectively).

TI  - Mapping Tree Height in Burkina Faso Parklands with TanDEM-X
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of tree height is of great importance for management, planning, and research related to agroforestry parklands in Africa. In this paper, we investigate the potential of spotlight-mode data from the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) satellite system TanDEM-X (TDM) for mapping of tree height in Sapone, Burkina Faso, a test site characterised by a low average canopy cover (similar to 15%) and a mean tree height of 9.0 m. Seven TDM acquisitions from January-April 2018 are used jointly to create high-resolution (similar to 3 m) maps of interferometric phase height and mean canopy elevation, the latter derived using a new, model-based processing approach compensating for some effects of the side-looking geometry of SAR. Compared with phase height, mean canopy elevation provides a more accurate representation of tree height variations, a better tree positioning accuracy, and better tree height estimation performance when assessed using 915 trees inventoried in situ and representing 15 different species/genera. We observe and discuss two bias effects, and we use empirical models to compensate for these effects. The best-performing model using only TDM data provides tree height estimates with a standard error (SE) of 2.8 m (31% of the average height) and a correlation coefficient of 75%. The estimation performance is further improved when TDM height data are combined with in situ measurements; this is a promising result in view of future synergies with other remote sensing techniques or ground measurement-supported monitoring of well-known trees.

TI  - Some Results and Prospects of Landscape Mapping of Russia
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape maps of Russia at various scales, including individual cartographic products, maps in scientific papers, and comprehensive scientific-reference atlases, as well as digital spatial data on landscapes, have been inventoried. A review of data sources for landscape-cartographic studies in the area of contemporary Russia from 1959 until now and the results of searching for landscape maps on the Internet are given. Taking the difficulties in searching for analog and digital landscape maps and sets of spatial data on landscapes in libraries, bibliographic publications, and databases into consideration, it is proposed to create a metadata base and provide free access to it on the Landscapes of Russia geoportal. It is aimed at disseminating existing Russian and foreign data sources and integrating geosciences data based on geoportal technologies and web mapping tools. The current status of landscape mapping of land and aquatic areas of Russia (Far East; southern Eastern Siberia; Altai; North Caucasus; and the north, northwest, and center of European Russia) is illustrated by some regional case studies (totaling approximately 60 names), which differ in the available cartographic data. The prospects of future landscape mapping include a further improvement of methods and technologies to obtain remote sensing data, as well as the identification of emergent properties of geosystems. The principles of compilation of landscape maps and of the structure of their analysis are formulated with regard for the system properties of the research object (a special subject of landscape science, which is not limited only to the synthesis of information from geology, geomorphology, pedology, botany, etc.), and for practical needs of nature management.

TI  - The High-Yielding Lambrusco (<i>Vitis vinifera </i>L.) Grapevine District Can Benefit from Precision Viticulture
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The best Lambrusco wines are often obtained by blending a representative of the Lambrusco family (i.e., Lambrusco Salamino) with a smaller fraction of Ancellotta, a teinturier variety possessing an extraordinary quality of accumulating color. Because of the economic importance of the Lambrusco business and the rising interest in precision viticulture, a two-year trial was carried out in seven vineyard plots growing both the named varieties. A RapidEye satellite image taken on 9 Aug 2018 led to vigor maps based on unfiltered normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In both years, ground truthing was performed on the test vines chosen within each vigor area for soil features, vegetative growth, yield, grape, and final wine composition. For data pooled over sites and years, Ancellotta showed a very clear response to NDVI-based vigor mapping, as low vigor areas always achieved improved ripening in terms of higher total soluble solids (+1.24 Brix), color and phenols (+0.36 mg/kg and +0.44 mg/kg, respectively), and lower malate (-1.79 g/L) versus high vigor. Such a behavior was shown even in those cases where NDVI of different vigor levels and pruning weight were not closely correlated and, most notably, low vigor matched with a slightly higher yield as compared to high vigor plots. Overall, the high-yielding Lambrusco Salamino was less responsive in terms of vine performance and grape composition versus intravineyard variability. This study highlights that in Ancellotta, adjusting the vine balance toward ostensible lower vigor (i.e., pruning weight <= 1 kg/m) would result in a superior choice in terms of improved ripening and wine profiles would not be detrimentally affected by the yield level which, in fact, increased in some cases.

TI  - An Efficient Decision Support System for Flood Inundation Management Using Intermittent Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely acquisition of spatial flood distribution is an essential basis for flood-disaster monitoring and management. Remote-sensing data have been widely used in water-body surveys. However, due to the cloudy weather and complex geomorphic environment, the inability to receive remote-sensing images throughout the day has resulted in some data being missing and unable to provide dynamic and continuous flood inundation process data. To fully and effectively use remote-sensing data, we developed a new decision support system for integrated flood inundation management based on limited and intermittent remote-sensing data. Firstly, we established a new multi-scale water-extraction convolutional neural network named DEU-Net to extract water from remote-sensing images automatically. A specific datasets training method was created for typical region types to separate the water body from the confusing surface features more accurately. Secondly, we built a waterfront contour active tracking model to implicitly describe the flood movement interface. In this way, the flooding process was converted into the numerical solution of the partial differential equation of the boundary function. Space upwind difference format and the time Euler difference format were used to perform the numerical solution. Finally, we established seven indicators that considered regional characteristics and flood-inundation attributes to evaluate flood-disaster losses. The cloud model using the entropy weight method was introduced to account for uncertainties in various parameters. In the end, a decision support system realizing the flood losses risk visualization was developed by using the ArcGIS application programming interface (API). To verify the effectiveness of the model constructed in this paper, we conducted numerical experiments on the model's performance through comparative experiments based on a laboratory scale and actual scale, respectively. The results were as follows: (1) The DEU-Net method had a better capability to accurately extract various water bodies, such as urban water bodies, open-air ponds, plateau lakes etc., than the other comparison methods. (2) The simulation results of the active tracking model had good temporal and spatial consistency with the image extraction results and actual statistical data compared with the synthetic observation data. (3) The application results showed that the system has high computational efficiency and noticeable visualization effects. The research results may provide a scientific basis for the emergency-response decision-making of flood disasters, especially in data-sparse regions.

TI  - Mapping Plastic Greenhouses with Two-Temporal Sentinel-2 Images and 1D-CNN Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic greenhouses (PGs) are widely built near cities in China to produce vegetables and fruits. In order to promote sustainable agriculture, rural landscape construction, and better manage water resources, numerous remote sensing methods have been developed to identify and monitor the distribution of PGs, of which many map PGs based on spectral responses and geometric shapes. In this study, we proposed a new fine- and coarse-scale mapping approach using two-temporal Sentinel-2 images with various seasonal characteristics and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). Having applied this approach in a pilot area study, the results were summarized as follows: (1) A time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 images showed that the reflectance of greenhouses changes during crop growth and development. In particular, the red-edge and near-infrared bands undergo a significant increase and then decrease during the whole crop growth period. Thus, two critical period images, containing a substantial difference in greenhouse reflectance, were sufficient to carry out an accurate and efficient mapping result. (2) The 1D-CNN classifier was used to map greenhouses by capturing subtle details and the overall trend of the spectrum curve. Overall, our approach showed higher classification accuracy than other approaches using support vector machines (SVM) or random forests (RF). In addition, the greenhouse area identified was highly consistent with the existing surfaces observed in very high-resolution images, with a kappa co-efficient of 0.81. (3) The narrow band feature differences (red-edge and near infrared narrow bands) in two-temporal Sentinel-2 images played a significant role in high-precision greenhouse mapping. The classification accuracy with narrow band features was much better than the maps produced without narrow band features. This scheme provided a method to digitize greenhouse precisely and publish its statistics for free, which enable advanced decision support for agriculture management.

TI  - Start of the Green Season and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in Alaska's Arctic National Parks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from the MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites were compared with on-the-ground camera observations at five locations in northern Alaska. Over half of the spring rise in NDVI was due to the transition from the snow-covered landscape to the snow-free surface prior to the deciduous leaf-out. In the fall after the green season, NDVI fluctuated between an intermediate level representing senesced vegetation and lower values representing clouds and intermittent snow, and then dropped to constant low levels after establishment of the permanent winter snow cover. The NDVI value of snow-free surfaces after fall leaf senescence was estimated from multi-year data using a 90th percentile smoothing spline curve fit to a plot of daily NDVI values vs. ordinal date. This curve typically showed a flat region of intermediate NDVI values in the fall that represent cloud- and snow-free days with senesced vegetation. This "fall plateau" was readily identified in a large systematic sample of MODIS NDVI values across the study area, in typical tundra, shrub, and boreal forest environments. The NDVI level of the fall plateau can be extrapolated to the spring rising leg of the annual NDVI curve to approximate the true start of green season.

TI  - Growing Stock Volume Retrieval from Single and Multi-Frequency Radar Backscatter
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - While products generated at global levels provide easy access to information on forest growing stock volume (GSV), their use at regional to national levels is limited by temporal frequency, spatial resolution, or unknown local errors that may be overcome through locally calibrated products. This study assessed the need, and utility, of developing locally calibrated GSV products for the Romanian forests. To this end, we used national forest inventory (NFI) permanent sampling plots with largely concurrent SAR datasets acquired at C- and L-bands to train and validate a machine learning algorithm. Different configurations of independent variables were evaluated to assess potential synergies between C- and L-band. The results show that GSV estimation errors at C- and L-band were rather similar, relative root mean squared errors (RelRMSE) around 55% for forests averaging over 450 m(3) ha(-1), while synergies between the two wavelengths were limited. Locally calibrated models improved GSV estimation by 14% when compared to values obtained from global datasets. However, even the locally calibrated models showed particularly large errors over low GSV intervals. Aggregating the results over larger areas considerably reduced (down to 25%) the relative estimation errors.

TI  - Estimation of Ultrahigh Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Mass Concentrations Based on Mie Scattering Theory by Using Landsat8 OLI Images over Pearl River Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD), retrieved by satellites, has been widely used to estimate ground-level PM2.5 mass concentrations, due to its advantage of large-scale spatial continuity. However, it is difficult to obtain urban-scale pollution patterns from the coarse resolution retrieval results (e.g., 1 km, 3 km, or 10 km) at present, and little research has been conducted on PM2.5 mass concentration retrieval from high resolution remote sensing data. In this study, a physical model is proposed based on Mie scattering theory to evaluate the PM2.5 mass concentrations by using Landsat8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. First, the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) model (which can simulate the transmission process of solar radiation in the Earth-atmosphere system and calculate the radiance at the top of the atmosphere) is used to build a lookup table to retrieve the AOD of the coast and blue bands based on the improved deep blue (DB) method. Then, the Angstrom formula is used to obtain the AOD of the green and red bands. Second, the dry near-surface AOD of four bands (coast, blue, green, red) is obtained through vertical correction and humidity correction. Third, aerosol particles are divided into four types based on the standard radiation atmosphere (SRA) model, and the optical properties of different aerosol types are analyzed to derive the volume distribution of aerosol particles. Finally, the relationship between the dry near-surface AOD of each band and the volume distribution of four aerosol particles is correlated, based on Mie scattering theory, and a physical model is established between the AOD and PM2.5 mass concentrations. Then, the distribution of PM2.5 mass concentrations is obtained. The retrieval results show that the distribution of AOD and PM2.5 at the urban scale in detail. The AOD results show that a reasonable relationship with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.66 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1037 between Landsat8 OLI AOD and MODO4 DB AOD at 550 nm. The PM2.5 retrieval results are compared with the PM2.5 values measured by ground monitoring stations. The RMSEs for a certain day in different years, including 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, are 11.9470 mu g/m(3), 11.9787 mu g/m(3), 7.4217 mu g/m(3), and 5.4723 mu g/m(3), respectively. The total RMSE is 10.0224 mu g/m(3). The ultrahigh resolution PM2.5 results can provide pollution details at the urban scale and support better decisions on urban atmospheric environmental governance.

TI  - A method for predicting large-area missing observations in Landsat time series using spectral-temporal metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined with increasing computing ability, the free and open access to Landsat archive has enabled the changes on the Earth?s surface to be monitored for almost 50 years. However, due to missing observations that result from clouds, cloud shadows, and scan line corrector failure, the Landsat data record is neither a continuous nor consistent time series. We present a new gap-filling method, Missing Observation Prediction based on Spectral-Temporal Metrics (MOPSTM), which uses spectral-temporal metrics computed from Landsat one-year time series and the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) regression. Herein, we demonstrate the performance of MOPSTM by using five, nearly cloud-free, full scene Landsat images from Kenya, Finland, Germany, the USA, and China. Cloud masks from the images with extensive cloud cover were used to simulate large-area gaps, with the highest value we tested being 92% of missing data. The gap-filling accuracy was assessed quantitatively considering all five sites and different land use/land cover types, and the MOPSTM algorithm performed better than the spectral-angle-mapper based spatiotemporal similarity (SAMSTS) gap-filling algorithm. The mean RMSE values of MOPSTM were 0.010, 0.012, 0.025, 0.012, and 0.018 for the five sites, while those of SAMSTS were 0.011, 0.017, 0.038, 0.014, and 0.023, respectively. Furthermore, MOPSTM had mean coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.90, 0.86, 0.78, 0.92, and 0.89, which were higher than those for SAMSTS (0.84, 0.75, 0.55, 0.89, and 0.83). The performance of MOPSTM was not considerably affected by image gap sizes as images ranging from gap sizes of 51% of the image all the way to 92% of the image yielded similar gap-filling accuracy. Also, MOPSTM does not require local parametertuning except for the k values in the k-NN regression, and it can make a gap-free image from any acquisition date. MOPSTM provides a new spectral-temporal approach to generate the gap-free imagery for typical Landsat applications, such as land use, land cover, and forest monitoring.

TI  - Towards Streamlined Single-Image Super-Resolution: Demonstration with 10 m Sentinel-2 Colour and 10-60 m Multi-Spectral VNIR and SWIR Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher spatial resolution imaging data are considered desirable in many Earth observation applications. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the TARSGAN (learning Terrestrial image deblurring using Adaptive weighted dense Residual Super-resolution Generative Adversarial Network) system for Super-resolution Restoration (SRR) of 10 m/pixel Sentinel-2 "true" colour images as well as all the other multispectral bands. In parallel, the ELF (automated image Edge detection and measurements of edge spread function, Line spread function, and Full width at half maximum) system is proposed to achieve automated and precise assessments of the effective resolutions of the input and SRR images. Subsequent ELF measurements of the TARSGAN SRR results suggest an averaged effective resolution enhancement factor of about 2.91 times (equivalent to similar to 3.44 m/pixel for the 10 m/pixel bands) given a nominal SRR upscaling factor of 4 times. Several examples are provided for different types of scenes from urban landscapes to agricultural scenes and sea-ice floes.

TI  - A Satellite View of an Intense Snowfall in Madrid (Spain): The Storm 'Filomena' in January 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating satellite ability in capturing sudden natural disasters such as heavy snowstorms is a topic of societal interest. This paper presents a rapid qualitative analysis of an intense snowfall in Madrid using data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, specifically the GPM IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) Late Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees V06 estimates of precipitation (IMERG-Late), and Sentinel-2 imagery. The main research question addressed is the consistency of ground observations, model outputs and satellite data, a topic of major interest for an appropriate and timely societal response to severe weather episodes. Indeed, the choice of the 'Late' product over the IMERG 'Final' or other GPM datasets was motivated by the availability of data for near real-time response to the storm. Additionally, the 30-min temporal resolution of the product would in principle allow for a detailed analysis of the dynamic processes involved in the snowstorm. Using several complementary data sources, it is shown that optical remote sensing sensors (Sentinel) add value to existing ground data and that is invaluable for rapid response to severe meteorological events such as Filomena. Regarding the GPM precipitation radar, the sampling of the GPM-core satellite was insufficient to provide the IMERG algorithm with enough quality data to correctly represent the actual sequence of precipitation. Without corrections, the total precipitation differs from observations by a factor of two. The difficulties of retrieving precipitation with radiometers over snow-covered surfaces was a major factor for the mismatch. Thus, the calibrated precipitation product did not fully capture the historic storm, and neither did the IR-based element of the IMERG-Late product, which is a neural network merging of microwave and infrared data. It follows that increased temporal resolution of spaceborne microwave sensors and improved retrieval of precipitation from radiometers are critical in order to provide a complete account of these sorts of extreme, significant, short-duration cases. Otherwise, the high-quality, radar and radiometer data feeding the high temporal resolution algorithms simply slip through the grasp of the ascending and descending orbits, leaving little quality data to be interpolated into successive overpasses.

TI  - Modeling of the Suspended Matter Balance in the Selenga River Delta Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a methodology developed for assessing the distribution of suspended sediment and metal fluxes along the Selenga delta channels and their accumulation by aquatic vegetation, based on the interpretation of Landsat-5, -7 and -8 and Sentinel-2/MSI satellite images, with clarification according to field data collected in 2011-2016. The methodology has great potential for application, because it allows to obtain quantitative characteristics of suspended sediment and metals balances based only on satellite images and data on discharges of suspended matter and metals at a delta apex. Calculation of the sediment budget allowed us to obtain the first quantitative data on the relationship of erosion-accumulation processes with water discharges in the Selenga River delta: for water discharges larger than 1500 m(3)/s, a steady predominance of sediment accumulation in the delta was observed. For smaller discharges there are cases of a longitudinal increase in the suspended sediment flux related with the backwater from Lake Baikal and channel erosion in the delta. On average, approximately 30% of the suspended sediment flux accumulates in the delta. Using the example of July 24, 2014, it was shown that 43% of the investigated metals flux (Mg, Al, Ti, Tl) accumulated in the delta. In the accumulation of metals, the channel and floodplain components account for 73 and 23%, respectively; and 3% is due to aquatic vegetation.

TI  - Modified Manikin for Tracheoinnominate Artery Fistula.
T2  - Journal of education & teaching in emergency medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Audience: This simulator is designed to instruct emergency medicine residents in tracheostomy training that involves bleeding from the tracheostomy site. Any resident, fellow, or attending physician who cares for patients with complications from their tracheostomy might benefit from this innovation.Introduction: The emergency medicine provider must maintain proficiency in caring for patients with complications from their tracheostomy. In the United States, over 110,000 patients receive tracheostomies per year.1 A rare but catastrophic complication of tracheostomies, usually within the first month of placement, is a tracheoinnominate artery fistula (TIAF). This complication occurs in 0.7% of tracheostomy patients and carries a 50-70% mortality.1,2 We modified a low-fidelity tracheostomy manikin to instruct learners in the stepwise management of hemorrhage from a TIAF.Educational Objectives: By the end of this educational session, learners will be able to:Perform a focused history and physical exam on any patient who presents with bleeding from the tracheostomy site.Describe the differential diagnosis of bleeding from a tracheostomy site, including a TIAF.Demonstrate the stepwise management of bleeding from a suspected TIAF, including cuff hyperinflation and the Utley Maneuver.Verify that definitive airway control via endotracheal intubation is only feasible in the tracheostomy patient when it is clear, upon history and exam, that the patient can be intubated from above.Demonstrate additional critical actions in the management of a patient with a TIAF, including early consultation with otolaryngology and cardiothoracic surgery as well as emergent blood transfusion and activation of a massive transfusion protocol.Educational Methods: This modified manikin is a useful training tool for any healthcare provider who is involved in the treatment and stabilization of a variety of tracheostomy emergencies, from bleeding to infection to obstruction or dislodgement. Our case was presented on two separate occasions, to otolaryngology interns (PGY-1), and emergency medicine residents (PGY 1-3). It involved the care of a patient with a sentinel bleed and subsequent hemorrhage from a tracheoinnominate artery fistula (TIAF). This low-fidelity tracheostomy manikin provides the ideal platform for any complex, tracheostomy case, particularly where ongoing bleeding from the tracheostomy site might permanently damage the electrical circuitry of a high-fidelity model. We initially fashioned this modified manikin for tracheostomy training during a simulation "boot camp" for otolaryngology PGY-1 residents. Our use of this modified manikin for tracheostomy training was a useful teaching tool during our otolaryngology intern "boot camp." As a result, we organized a subsequent simulation training session with our PGY 1-3 emergency medicine residents to provide similar instruction in management of a TIAF.Research Methods: We provided a pre- and a post-simulation survey for the 33 emergency medicine residents who participated in the TIAF simulation with our modified tracheostomy manikin. There were 11 residents from each of the PGY-1, PGY-2, and PGY-3 year-groups. Thirty-two residents (97%) completed the pre-simulation survey, and 33 residents (100%) completed the post-simulation survey. We used a 6-point Likert Scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" to assess a resident's knowledge of multiple learning objectives within this simulation.Results: The pre- and post-simulation survey supported this simulation and manikin innovation as a useful teaching tool for tracheostomy emergencies such as a TIAF.Discussion: This was a useful innovation for emergency provider training in the recognition and management of a TIAF, a rare but emergent tracheostomy complication. In addition to this bleeding complication, this innovation might be useful for a variety of tracheostomy emergencies such as site infection, obstruction, and tube dislodgement. We highly recommend the involvement of both an emergency medicine and otolaryngology content expert in the design and debriefing of tracheostomy cases with this modified manikin. In our experience, a facilitated debriefing by an experienced clinician and educator from both fields provided a diverse perspective for challenging cases such as bleeding from a TIAF.Topics: Difficult airway, tracheostomy, tracheoinnominate fistula, hemorrhagic shock, tracheostomy complications, Utley Maneuver.

T2  - Journal of education & teaching in emergency medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Audience: This simulation provides training for emergency medicine residents in the stepwise management of a patient who presents with bleeding from a tracheoinnominate artery fistula. Additional learners who might benefit from this simulation are otolaryngology and general surgery residents as well as critical care fellows.Introduction: Hemorrhage from a tracheoinnominate artery fistula (TIAF) is a rare but life-threatening complication in a patient with a recent tracheostomy. This complication occurs in 0.7% of tracheostomy patients with a mortality of 50-70%.1 Seventy-five percent of patients with a TIAF will present within the first three weeks of surgery and 50% of patients will present with a sentinel bleed that briefly resolves.1 Key elements of a history and exam that should raise a provider's concern for this diagnosis include a recent tracheostomy (within the last 4 weeks), a percutaneous tracheostomy, prior radiation, chronic steroid use, a neck or chest deformity or a sentinel bleed.2 Survival from a TIAF hinges upon emergent, operative repair by an otolaryngologist and cardiothoracic surgeon. Cuff hyperinflation and the Utley Maneuver are critical bedside interventions to temporize this massive bleed and stabilize the patient for definitive, operative repair.Educational Objectives: By the end of this simulation, learners will be able to: 1) perform a focused history and physical exam on any patient who presents with bleeding from the tracheostomy site, 2) describe the differential diagnosis of bleeding from a tracheostomy site, including a TIAF, 3) demonstrate the stepwise management of bleeding from a suspected TIAF, including cuff hyperinflation and the Utley Maneuver, 4) verify that definitive airway control via endotracheal intubation is only feasible in the tracheostomy patient when it is clear, upon history and exam, that the patient can be intubated from above, 5) demonstrate additional critical actions in the management of a patient with a TIAF, including early consultation with otolaryngology and cardiothoracic surgery as well as emergent blood transfusion and activation of a massive transfusion protocol.Educational Methods: This case was written with a modified, low-fidelity manikin, traditionally used for training in nasogastric tube placement and tracheostomy care. We modified this manikin to simulate a hemorrhage from the tracheostomy site.3 The patient in our case had a history of laryngeal cancer, and thus we occluded his larynx for this simulation. As a result of this obstruction, he was unable to be intubated from above. We provided confederates, a bedside nurse and family member, to assist the learners throughout the case. We also utilized a simulation technician to operate dynamic vital signs on a simulated cardiac monitor. It would be technically challenging to adapt this case to a high-fidelity simulator due to potential for damage of the internal electrical elements by the large amount of artificial blood from the tracheostomy tube. However, a mechanical pump provided a useful means of active bleeding in this low-fidelity manikin.Research Methods: We provided a pre- and post-simulation questionnaire for the 33 emergency medicine residents who participated in this simulation. There were 11 residents from each of the PGY-1, PGY-2 and PGY-3 year-groups. Thirty-two residents (97%) completed the pre-survey and 33 residents (100%) completed the post-survey. For our questions, we used a 5-point Likert Scale to assess a resident's knowledge of the learning objectives within this simulation.Results: Responses from our pre- and post- survey indicated a significant improvement in knowledge about a tracheoinnominate artery fistula as well as the general management of tracheostomy complications in the emergency department.Discussion: This simulation is a useful educational tool for instructing emergency medicine residents on optimal management of tracheostomy emergencies such as a TIAF. The interprofessional teaching by an emergency medicine attending and mid-level (PGY-3) otolaryngology resident allowed for a richer and more detailed discussion during the debriefing. Throughout the case, the emergency medicine attending played the role of a bedside nurse and offered supportive, clinical cues when bleeding recurred. The otolaryngology resident played the role of a family member and offered helpful cues during the history and exam portion of the case. Following the case, both content experts provided useful clinical insight during the debriefing. If staffing availability permits, it might be advantageous to use additional simulation-trained personnel to play the roles of the nurse and family member, thus allowing the emergency medicine attending and otolaryngology content experts to simply view the case from the control room and perform the debriefing.Topics: Tracheostomy, surgical airway, tracheoinnominate artery fistula, bleeding from tracheostomy site, complications with tracheostomies, hemorrhagic shock.

TI  - Observing and Predicting Coastal Erosion at the Langue de Barbarie Sand Spit around Saint Louis (Senegal, West Africa) through Satellite-Derived Digital Elevation Model and Shoreline
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion at Saint Louis in Senegal is affecting the local population that consists of primarily fishermen communities in their housing and their access to the sea. This paper aims at quantifying urban beach erosion at Saint Louis, Senegal, West Africa which is located on the northern end of the 13 km long Langue de Barbarie sand spit. The coastal evolution is examined quantitatively over a yearly period using Pleiades sub-metric satellite imagery that allows for stereogrammetry to derive Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The comparison with ground truth data shows sub-metric differences to the satellite DEMs. Despite its interest in remote areas and developing countries that cannot count on regular surveys, the accuracy of the satellite-derived topography is in the same order as the coastal change itself, which emphasizes its current limitations. These 3D data are combined with decades-long regular Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery derived shorelines. These observations reveal that the sand spit is stretching, narrowing at its Northern part while it is lengthening downdrift Southward, independently from climatological changes in the wave regime. A parametric model based on a stochastic cyclic sand spit behaviour allows for predicting the next northern opening of a breach and the urban erosion at Saint Louis.

TI  - Spectro-temporal analysis of the Paraopeba River water after the tailings dam burst of the Corrego do FeijAo mine, in Brumadinho, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important tool for environmental assessment, especially in the event of disasters such as the tailings dam burst at the Corrego do FeijAo mine, located in the Paraopeba River basin, Brazil. Thus, this study aimed to carry out a spectro-temporal analysis of the Paraopeba River water given the dam burst, using multispectral images from the MSI sensor onboard Sentinel-2 satellites. For this analysis, sections along the river were defined by the creation of buffers, with 10-km intervals each, starting from the origin of the burst. For each section, the average visible to near-infrared (NIR) reflectance values per band and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were obtained. We found that the red edge and NIR bands (B5, B6, B7, B8, and B8A) showed higher reflectance values when compared to the visible bands in the months immediately after the disaster, especially in the first 20 km. In these months, negative NDWI values were also found for almost all sections downstream, demonstrating the large volume of mining tailings in the Paraopeba River. The seasonal variation of the observed values indicates the resuspension of the material deposited at the river bottom with the beginning of the rainy season. Finally, we highlight the usefulness of the MSI/Sentinel-2 red edge and NIR bands for further studies on the monitoring from space of water bodies subjected to contamination by large amounts of mud with iron ore tailings and contaminants, as occurred in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The case involved a 51-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Stage Ⅰ right breast cancer(cT1, N0, M0). Partial resection of the right breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The histological type was found to be Stage Ⅰ triple-negative medullary carcinoma with pT1c, pN0(sn), and M0. A pituitary tumor was diagnosed after discharge. After removal of the pituitary tumor, whole-breast irradiation was performed. Subsequently, chemotherapy was started. Approximately 5 months after surgery, redness and swelling of the right breast were observed. Inflammatory breast cancer recurrence could not be ruled out by imaging, and skin biopsy was performed. No malignant findings were observed, and the symptoms were considered to indicate radiation recall dermatitis caused by chemotherapy. When chemotherapy was discontinued, the redness of the right breast improved.

TI  - Evolution of the Drainage System in Yamuna-Sutlej Interfluve - Multi-disciplinary Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yamuna-Sutlej interfluve area has been important because of the presence of several palaeochannels that are hypothesized to be linked to Rigvedic river Saraswati that is now lost in time and space. Using satellite data, followed by field studies, the palaeo-course of a major river system in parts of the foothills of Himalaya, piedmont zone and plains of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan has been delineated. The palaeocourse of this major river system originating from south of Ropar, flowing southwards, combined with its tributaries including Ghaggar near Shutrana in Punjab flowed further south-west in parts of India and Pakistan culminating at Kutch. Along the length of interpreted palaeochannel, numerous Indus valley civilization sites are present. The field investigations with systematic sampling for geochronological analysis using thermo luminescence/optically stimulated luminescence (TL/OSL) technique, petro-mineraosedimentological studies have substantiated the existence of palaeochannels on the ground. Comprehensive remote-sensing investigations backed by geochronological input reveals that Sutlej palaeochannel was the main contributor of perennial water source at around 12 +/- 1 ka before shifting its course to present state and the palaeochannels between Yamuna-Sutlej interfluve were its tributaries, the most important being Ghaggar. The Sutlej palaeochannel was active till 12 ka and was receiving Himalayan sediments before the advent of aeolian episodes at around 12 ka and 7.4 +/- 0.4 ka. However, sediments from the river bed of the present Ghaggar river near Anupgarh indicates that the palaeochannel was receiving water supply till 5.2 ka having sufficient energy to deposit fine sand.

TI  - Impact of climate change on snowmelt runoff in a Himalayan basin, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is one of the major sources of fresh water on Earth and is currently under serious threat of climate change. This study investigates the future water availability in the Langtang basin, Central Himalayas, Nepal under climate change scenarios using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. The daily snow area for the region was derived from MODIS images. The outputs of climate models were used to project the temperature and precipitation until 2100. Three ML models, including Gated recurrent unit (GRU), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Recurrent neural network (RNN), were developed for snowmelt runoff prediction, and their performance was compared based on statistical indicators. The result suggests that the mean temperature of the basin could rise by 4.98 degrees C by the end of the century. The annual average precipitation in the basin is likely to increase in the future, especially due to high monsoon rainfall, but winter precipitation could decline. The annual river discharge is projected to upsurge significantly due to increased precipitation and snowmelt, and no shift in hydrograph is expected in the future. Among three ML models, the LSTM model performed better than GRU and RNN models. In summary, this study depicts severe future climate change in the region and quantifies its effect on river discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the suitability of the LSTM model in streamflow prediction in the data-scarce HKH region. The outcomes of this study will be useful for water resource managers and planners in developing strategies to harness the positive impacts and offset the negative effects of climate change in the basin.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Estimation in Short Rotation Forest Plantations in Northern Greece Using ESA's Sentinel Medium-High Resolution Multispectral and Radar Imaging Missions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations of fast-growing forest species such as black locust (Robinia Pseudoacacia) can contribute to energy transformation, mitigate industrial pollution, and restore degraded, marginal land. In this study, the synergistic use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series data is explored for modeling aboveground biomass (AGB) in black locust short-rotation plantations in northeastern Greece. Optimal modeling dates and EO sensor data are also identified through the analysis. Random forest (RF) models were originally developed using monthly Sentinel-2 spectral indices, while, progressively, monthly Sentinel-1 bands were incorporated in the statistical analysis. The highest accuracy was observed for the models generated using Sentinel-2 August composites (R-2 = 0.52). The inclusion of Sentinel-1 bands in the spectral indices' models had a negligible effect on modeling accuracy during the leaf-on period. The correlation and comparative performance of the spectral indices in terms of pairwise correlation with AGB varied among the phenophases of the forest plantations. Overall, the field-measured AGB in the forest plantations plots presented a higher correlation with the optical Sentinel-2 images. The synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data proved to be a non-efficient approach for improving forest biomass RF models throughout the year within the geographical and environmental context of our study.

TI  - Quantitative Thermal Emission Spectroscopy at High Temperatures: A Laboratory Approach for Measurement and Calibration
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring accurate high temperature laboratory-based infrared emission spectra of geologic samples is important to constrain their radiative and spectral properties. This is important in calculations of lava flow cooling, crust formation, and ultimately lava flow propagation modeling. However, measuring accurate emission at high temperatures remains a challenge. A new micro-furnace design was created to integrate with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, replacing the previous furnace and improving the performance and error metrics. Importantly, this approach accounts for all significant error sources and uses only one spectrometer to acquire sample and calibration emission data over greater temperature (473-1,573 K) and spectral (4,000-500 cm(-1), 2.5-20 mu m) ranges. Emissivity spectra of forsterite and quartz samples were acquired to test the calibration procedure. Forsterite, with no expected phase transitions over the temperature range, showed spectral change above similar to 1140 K, potentially due to amorphization-a process not well described in past studies. The quartz results revealed the expected polymorph transformations at similar to 846 and similar to 1323 K. A Hawaiian basalt sample served as a representative rock test and showed an increase in emissivity (similar to 25%) with decreasing temperature. The greatest emissivity increase (similar to 60%) occurred in the middle infrared region (3,333-2,000 cm(-1), 3-5 mu m). This is significant for thermal/mass flux calculations using satellite data in this spectral region, which rely on emissivity to derive accurate temperatures. All results are consistent with our previous investigations, but with improved mean accuracy (<2%), uncertainty (<4%), and spectral contrast (<20%). The improved metrics were achieved by constraining the sample measurement geometry, sample temperature stability, and environmental contamination within the experiment.

TI  - AFRICAN FEMINISMS: FOR THE RIGHT TO BE A WOMAN IN <i>RABHIA</i>
T2  - REVISTA ARTEMIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Rabhia, by Lucilio Manjate, he reflects on the demeaning condition of women in Mozambique. In the specific case of the Mozambican kaleidoscope, there are many women who perform desire as a becoming, resulting from a previous situation of lack, absence, marginality and exclusion. By acting with prostitution, poverty and a gallery of crossed oppressions, as theorized by Akotirene (2019), the character who gives the title to the work, brings to light the concepts of some African feminisms, also adopting the variant African Womanism to problematize the distinctions, gaps and scope present in countless feminisms, at a local level, of an anti-colonial and intersectional nature. This research aims to study the agency of Mozambican women in Rabhia (2017), from an Afro-centered perspective of thought, capable of recognizing them as subjects of their own history, as well as self-named and self-defining, while (anti) heroines of the nation. From the perspective of Mc Fadden (2016), Salo e Mama (2011), Casimiro (2007), Ebunoluwa (2009), Salami (2017), Nah Dove (1998) and Hudson-Weems (1993), Oyewumi (2021), Studying African Feminisms and African Womensism respectively implies understanding gender politics outside an eminently white and Europeanized feminist tradition, to give place to the experiences of black women, within an Afrocentric paradigm, encompassing activism and exalting local culture as important analysis tool to reveal an anti-racial, anti-capitalist, anti-patriarchal, anti-sexist and, above all, anti-western-centric worldview. As the main result of this analysis, there is the emergence of new contemporary imperatives for African feminisms, which have relevance in the global scenario, demonstrating the need for the urgent struggle for social and civil rights of intersectional women: poor, black, blind and whores in Mozambique.

TI  - Refocusing of Moving Ships in Squint SAR Images Based on Spectrum Orthogonalization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moving ship refocusing is challenging because the target motion parameters are unknown. Moreover, moving ships in squint synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained by the back-projection (BP) algorithm usually suffer from geometric deformation and spectrum winding. Therefore, a spectrum-orthogonalization algorithm that refocuses moving ships in squint SAR images is presented. First, "squint minimization" is introduced to correct the spectrum by two spectrum compression functions: one to align the spectrum centers and another to translate the inclined spectrum into orthogonalized form. Then, the precise analytic function of the two-dimensional (2D) wavenumber spectrum is derived to obtain the phase error. Finally, motion compensation is performed in the two-dimensional wavenumber domain after the motion parameter is estimated by maximizing the image sharpness. This method has low computational complexity because it lacks interpolation and can be implemented by the inverse fast Fourier translation (IFFT) and fast Fourier translation (FFT). Processing results of simulation experiments and the GaoFen-3 squint SAR data validate the effectiveness of this method.

TI  - Assessment of the SASI Spectral Shape Index Time Series for Mapping Rice Ecosystems in the Mediterranean Region
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need to map rice ecosystems and to develop methods for monitoring rice distribution in order to account for rapid land use changes worldwide. In this study, we evaluated a methodology based on Vegetation Indices time series derived from an 8-day MODIS composite to identify rice fields and develop rice maps that can be timely updated in the long term. We have assessed the potential of the Spectral Shape Index time series and compared its performance with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in two coastal locations and in an inland location in the Mediterranean Region for 2012. A profile similarity comparison method, the Spectral Angle Mapper, was accomplished between the reference rice annual profile and the annual profiles of both indices in a pixel basis in order to determine rice pixels. The resultant maps were validated with rice masks, where available, or ortophotos and crop surface statistics where not. The results obtained demonstrated the potential of both indices to provide accurate rice maps when applied together with spectral matching techniques. The overall accuracy was 92.8%, 98.1% and 90.1% for the Spectral Shape Index and 92.4%, 77.24% and 82.8% for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in each location. The excellent performance of the Spectral Shape Index in the three locations highlighted the importance of exploring angular indices to improve the identification of land cover dynamics.

TI  - Geo-spatial Analysis of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Changes in Oluwa Forest Reserve and its environs
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Mankind's existence and modification of the landscape have had a profound effect on the natural environment. Anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, mining, deforestation and construction have influenced the shifting patterns of land use. This has resulted in a significant effect on local weather and climate. The use of remote sensing data in recent times has been of immense help in monitoring the changing pattern of vegetation. Therefore this study utilized remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) methods to identify factors responsible for land use land cover (LULC) changes in Oluwa Forest Reserve between 1984 and 2017. The result showed that Primary forest was reduced by about 5% between 1984 and 2000 and by about 12% between 2000 and 2017 and the non-forest got increased by about 4% and 2% from 1984 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2017 respectively. Future forecast shows that primary forest will decrease by about 3% while the non-forest will increase by 5% by 2034. The results also revealed that the changes in forest cover between 2000 and 2017 were actively influenced by the closeness of settlements to the forest. It is therefore recommended that the findings of this study should be adopted by relevant authorities as a useful forest management tool.

CP  - 6th International Conference on Scientific-Research Cooperation between Vietnam and Poland (VIET-POL)
CL  - HUMG, Hanoi, VIETNAM
AB  - Vietnam is an Asian country with hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year. Forests account for more than 40% of the total land area and have a very rich and diverse vegetation. Monitoring the changes in the vegetation cover is obviously important yet challenging, considering such large varying areas and climatic conditions. A traditional remote sensing technique to monitor the vegetation cover involves the use of optical satellite images. However, in presence of the cloud cover, the analyses done using optical satellite image are not reliable. In such a scenario, radar images are a useful alternative due to the ability of radar pulses in penetrating through the clouds, regardless of day or night. In this study, we have used multi temporal C band satellite images to monitor vegetation cover changes for an area in Dau Tieng and Ben Cat districts of Binh Duong province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. With a collection of 46 images between March 2015 and February 2017, the changes of five land cover types including vegetation loss and replanting in 2017 were analyzed by selecting two cases, using 9 images in the dry season of 3 years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and using all of 46 images to conduct Random Forest classifier with 100, 200, 300 and 500 trees respectively. The result in which the model with nine images and 300 trees gave the best accuracy with an overall accuracy of 98.4% and a Kappa of 0.97. The results demonstrated that using VH polarization, Sentinel-1 gives quite a good accuracy for vegetation cover change. Therefore, Sentinel-1 can also be used to generate reliable land cover maps suitable for different applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND One of the most important prognostic factors for mortality in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the development of nodal metastasis. There is no consensus regarding which patient with cSCC should be offered sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). OBJECTIVE This study aimed to establish the rate of positive SLNBs among patients with high-risk cSCCs and to identify which high-risk features are associated with a positive SLNB. METHODS Five-year retrospective case series in an academic tertiary care center reviewing 93 SLNBs. RESULTS Of the 93 SLNBs performed, 5 (5.4%) were positive. Three patients (3/5) had neck dissection and one (1/5) had radiation therapy, with no recurrence at the time of last follow-up. A tumor diameter >= 2 cm, a tumor depth >6 mm or below subcutaneous fat, perineural invasion of nerves with a diameter >= 0.1 mm, moderate or poor histological differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, and immunosuppression were associated with a positive SLNB. All tumors with a positive SLNB were classified as T2b according to the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) tumor staging. LIMITATIONS Retrospective study and absence of a control group. CONCLUSION Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered for BWH T2b and T3 tumors. However, more randomized controlled studies are needed.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies traditional knowledge as a key element of the identity, territory, and worldview of indigenous peoples. The authors study the unfair practices of the fashion industry to show that there is a lack of protection of the rights and interests of communities in this area. The methodology applied was analytical, from a deductive and systematic interpretative perspective, which allowed the authors to present their reflections in an interdisciplinary context, from the study of various specialized sources. After describing all these problems, the article proposes, as results, to resize equitable benefit-sharing from the fair trade and the right to prior consultation from constitutional law.

TI  - An Alternative Method for the Generation of Consistent Mapping to Monitoring Land Cover Change: A Case Study of Guerrero State in Mexico
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is crucial for ecosystems and human activities. Therefore, monitoring land cover changes has become relevant in recent years. This study proposes an alternative method based on conventional change detection techniques combined with maximum likelihood (MaxLike) supervised classification of satellite images to generate consistent Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps. The novelty of this method is that the supervised classification is applied in an earlier stage of change detection exclusively to identified dynamics zones. The LULC categories of the stable zones are acquired from an initial date's previously elaborated base map. The methodology comprised the use of Landsat images from 2011 and 2016, applying the Sun Canopy Sensor (SCS + C) topographic correction model enhanced through the classification of slopes, using derived topographic corrected images with NDVI, and employing Tasseled Cap (TC) Brightness-Greenness-Wetness indices and Principal Components (PCs). The study incorporated a comparative analysis of the consistency of the LULC mapping, which is generated based on control areas. The results show that the proposed method, although slightly laborious, is viable and fully automatable. The generated LULC map is accurate and robust and achieves a Kappa concordance index of 87.53. Furthermore, the boundary consistency was visually superior to the conventional classified map.

TI  - Automation in signal management in pharmacovigilance-an insight
T2  - BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Drugs are the imperial part of modern society, but along with their therapeutic effects, drugs can also cause adverse effects, which can be mild to morbid. Pharmacovigilance is the process of collection, detection, assessment, monitoring and prevention of adverse drug events in both clinical trials as well as in the post-marketing phase. The recent trends in increasing unknown adverse events, known as signals, have raised the need to develop an ideal system for monitoring and detecting the potential signals timely. The process of signal management comprises of techniques to identify individual case safety reports systematically. Automated signal detection is highly based upon the data mining of the spontaneous reporting system such as reports from health care professional, observational studies, medical literature or from social media. If a signal is not managed properly, it can become an identical risk associated with the drug which can be hazardous for the patient safety and may have fatal outcomes which may impact health care system adversely. Once a signal is detected quantitatively, it can be further processed by the signal management team for the qualitative analysis and further evaluations. The main components of automated signal detection are data extraction, data acquisition, data selection, and data analysis and data evaluation. This system must be developed in the correct format and context, which eventually emphasizes the quality of data collected and leads to the optimal decision-making based upon the scientific evaluation.

TI  - Estimating the Cost of Surgical Care Purchased in the Community by the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - MDM POLICY & PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Veterans' access to Veterans Affairs (VA)-purchased community care expanded due to large increases in funding provided in the 2014 Veterans Choice Act. Objectives. To compare costs between VA-delivered care and VA payments for purchased care for two commonly performed surgeries: total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and cataract surgeries. Research Design. Descriptive statistics and regressions examining costs in VA-delivered and VA-purchased care (fiscal year [FY] 2018 [October 2017 to September 2018]). Subjects. A total of 13,718 TKAs, of which 6,293 (46%) were performed in VA. A total of 91,659 cataract surgeries, of which 65,799 (72%) were performed in VA. Measures. Costs of VA-delivered care based on activity-based cost estimates; costs of VA-purchased care based on approved and paid claims. Results. Ninety-eight percent of VA-delivered TKAs occurred in inpatient hospitals, with an average cost of $28,969 (SD $10,778). The majority (86%) of VA-purchased TKAs were also performed at inpatient hospitals, with an average payment of $13,339 (SD $23,698). VA-delivered cataract surgeries were performed at hospitals as outpatient procedures, with an average cost of $4,301 (SD $2,835). VA-purchased cataract surgeries performed at hospitals averaged $1,585 (SD $629); those performed at ambulatory surgical centers cost an average of $1,346 (SD $463). We also found significantly higher Nosos risk scores for patients who used VA-delivered versus VA-purchased care. Conclusions. Costs of VA-delivered care were higher than payments for VA-purchased care, but this partly reflects legislative caps limiting VA payments to community providers to Medicare amounts. Higher patient risk scores in the VA could indicate that community providers are reluctant to accept high-risk patients because of Medicare reimbursements, or that VA providers prefer to keep the more complex patients in VA.

TI  - High-Resolution Spatio-Temporal Estimation of Net Ecosystem Exchange in Ice-Wedge Polygon Tundra Using In Situ Sensors and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-atmosphere carbon exchange is known to be extremely heterogeneous in arctic ice-wedge polygonal tundra regions. In this study, a Kalman filter-based method was developed to estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics of daytime average net ecosystem exchange (NEEday) at 0.5-m resolution over a 550 m by 700 m study site. We integrated multi-scale, multi-type datasets, including normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) obtained from a novel automated mobile sensor system (or tram system) and a greenness index map obtained from airborne imagery. We took advantage of the significant correlations between NDVI and NEEday identified based on flux chamber measurements. The weighted average of the estimated NEEday within the flux-tower footprint agreed with the flux tower data in term of its seasonal dynamics. We then evaluated the spatial variability of the growing season average NEEday, as a function of polygon geomorphic classes; i.e., the combination of polygon types-which are known to present different degradation stages associated with permafrost thaw-and microtopographic features (i.e., troughs, centers and rims). Our study suggests the importance of considering microtopographic features and their spatial coverage in computing spatially aggregated carbon exchange.

TI  - Application of TLS Remote Sensing Data in the Analysis of the Load-Carrying Capacity of Structural Steel Elements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements together with finite element method (FEM) numerical modeling to assess the current technical condition. The main aim of the paper was to evaluate the effect of point cloud size reduction on the quality of the geometric model and the ability to represent the corrosion level in assessing its load-carrying capacity. In this study, a standard scanning was performed on a historical object and a point cloud of a selected corroded element was generated. In order to further process the data, gradual reductions were made in the number of points from which meshes representing the geometry of the selected beam were created. Inaccuracy analyses of the meshes generated on the reduced point clouds were performed. Numerical analysis was then conducted for the selected mesh generated from the reduced point cloud. The results identified the locations of maximum stresses. The presented analysis showed that by developing the presented measurement and computational technique, laser scanning can be used to determine the degree of corrosion of hard-to-reach steel elements.

TI  - Cloud Detection of Landsat Image Based on MS-UNet
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem that the detection of thin clouds and broken clouds is very difficult due to the changeable cloud shapes in the research of cloud detection in RGB color remote sensing images, a U-shaped network based on multi-scale feature extraction (MS-UNet) is proposed. Firstly, a multi-scale module is proposed in order to obtain a larger receptive field while retaining more semantic information of the image. Secondly, the FReLU (Funnel Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is introduced in the first group of convolutions to obtain more spatial information. Finally, further feature extraction is performed after down-sampling, and in the up-sampling pixel recovery, the missing information is completed by jump layers, and the deep semantic features of the cloud are combined with the shallow detail features to achieve better cloud segmentation. Experimental results show that this method can effectively segment thin clouds and broken clouds. Compared with UNet, MF-CNN, SegNet, DeepLabV3_ResNet50, and DeepLabV3_ResNet101 networks, the overall accuracy is increased by 0.075, 0.065, 0.070, 0.013, and 0.005, respectively.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of nitrogen deposition on poplar plantation based on Gaofen and Sentinel imagery
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen deposition has multiple effects on forest ecosystems. Previous related studies mainly focused on immediate effects in the short term. It is critically needed to study long-term impacts of nitrogen deposition on forest ecosystems. To understand the effects of nitrogen deposition with different levels on forest ecosystem, a simulated nitrogen deposition experiment was conducted in a 8-year-old poplar (Populus deltoides) plantation since 2012, with the treatments of CK (0 kg.hm(-2).a(-1)), low nitrogen deposition (N1, 50 kg.hm(-2).a(-1)), medium nitrogen deposition (N2, 100 kg.hm(-2).a(-1)), high nitrogen deposition (N3, 150 kg.hm(-2).a(-1)), and ultrahigh nitrogen deposition (N4, 300 kg.hm(-2).a(-1)). The effects of nitrogen addition on the growth of poplar plantation over long time series was examined using Gaofen (GF1, GF2) and Sentinel (Sentinel-2) satellite images by extracting poplar NDVI values. The results showed that the NDVI values of poplar trees were increased by 2.0%, 4.8%, 4.3%, and 4.5% in the four N treatments, respectively. The maximum growth rate occurred after treated for two years. After four years of treatment, the NDVI values of poplar trees under nitrogen addition were all greater than that of the CK, which indicated that nitrogen deposition had positive effects on poplar growth. However, such promotion effects were overall weakened after three years. After being treated for six years, medium and low nitrogen deposition had a promoting effect on poplar growth, but high and ultrahigh nitrogen treatment had an inhibiting effect. Overall, the promoting effect was gradually weakened while the inhibiting effect was gradually enhanced with increasing nitrogen addition levels.

TI  - Developing Long Time Series 1-km Land Cover Maps From 5-km AVHRR Data Using a Super-Resolution Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic land cover (LC) information is an essential part of environmental and ecological research. Therefore, acquiring dynamic LC data with high spatial resolution has attracted a great deal of attention in the remote sensing community. Nevertheless, the high-temporal resolution satellite data tend to have a coarse spatial resolution, and satellite data with high temporal resolution are often relatively low. Obtaining LC with high spatiotemporal resolution is extremely challenging. The super-resolution method can help researchers achieve this goal, and the recently developed neural-network-based deep learning algorithms have great potential for use as an alternative solution. This study proposes a focal loss temporal convolutional long short-term memory (FL-T-ConvLSTM) model for super-resolution LC classification research. It first trains the deep FL-T-ConvLSTM network to establish a transformation between low-resolution quantitative remote sensing parameters and high-resolution quantitative remote sensing parameters and then engages in nonlinear mapping with a high-resolution LC map. A long-term series 1-km super-resolution LC classification model based on deep learning was established and applied to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Based on this method, a long-term series of 1-km LC maps from 1982 to 2019 can be obtained. The test accuracy and field validation accuracy of the model reached 90.1% and 86.8% when using reliable test samples and field test samples, respectively. This study provides a method for obtaining high-resolution LC classification products from low-resolution quantitative remote-sensing products.

TI  - Feature Fusion Approach for Temporal Land Use Mapping in Complex Agricultural Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate temporal land use mapping provides important and timely information for decision making for large-scale management of land and crop production. At present, temporal land cover and crop classifications within a study area have neglected the differences between subregions. In this paper, we propose a classification rule by integrating the terrain, time series characteristics, priority, and seasonality (TTPSR) with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Based on the time series of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Vegetation Index (NDVI), a dynamic decision tree for forests, cultivation, urban, and water was created in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for each subregion to extract cultivated land. Then, with or without this cultivated land mask data, the original classification results for each subregion were completed based on composite image acquisition with five vegetation indices using Random Forest. During the post-reclassification process, a 4-bit coding rule based on terrain, type, seasonal rhythm, and priority was generated by analyzing the characteristics of the original results. Finally, statistical results and temporal mapping were processed. The results showed that feature importance was dominated by B2, NDWI, RENDVI, B11, and B12 over winter, and B11, B12, NDBI, B2, and B8A over summer. Meanwhile, the cultivated land mask improved the overall accuracy for multicategories (seven to eight and nine to 13 during winter and summer, respectively) in each subregion, with average ranges in the overall accuracy for winter and summer of 0.857-0.935 and 0.873-0.963, respectively, and kappa coefficients of 0.803-0.902 and 0.835-0.950, respectively. The analysis of the above results and the comparison with resampling plots identified various sources of error for classification accuracy, including spectral differences, degree of field fragmentation, and planting complexity. The results demonstrated the capability of the TTPSR rule in temporal land use mapping, especially with regard to complex crops classification and automated post-processing, thereby providing a viable option for large-scale land use mapping.

TI  - Using a New Top-Down Constrained Emissions Inventory to Attribute the Previously Unknown Source of Extreme Aerosol Loadings Observed Annually in the Monsoon Asia Free Troposphere
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of biomass burning to the total aerosol loading over Monsoon Asia is both significant and continuing to increase. To better match the spatio-temporal distribution of aerosols and trace gasses observed in the free troposphere, this work applied a 3-D constrained emission inventory based on top-down remotely sensed NO2 measurement to investigate the most extreme of the annually occurring biomass burning seasons in Monsoon Asia. In 2016, this constituted an extreme event observed over a 6-day period covering millions of square kilometers, including over regions that are typically in the rainy phase of the Asian Monsoon. The results are shown to be consistent with respect to Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation, AERONET measurements, MODIS AOD, MOPITT CO, and reanalysis meteorology, over both the biomass burning source as well as the millions of square kilometers downwind both to the East and to the Southwest. Reproducing the observed long-range transport pattern requires the time of biomass burning to be increased, regions not previously identified as burning to be actual source regions, and the emissions of Black Carbon (BC) to be 6.6 to 11.9 times larger than current inventories. The underlying mechanism for this long-range transport involves a new 3-D pathway that can occur during the transition from the North phase to the South phase of the Asian Monsoon. The results are also consistent with the new idea that large loadings of BC in the lower free troposphere may significantly affect the meteorological field and the overall vertical distribution of aerosols in the tropical troposphere.

TI  - Contributions of Vegetation Greening and Climate Change to Evapotranspiration Trend after Large-Scale Vegetation Restoration on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the early 2000s, the vegetation cover of the Loess Plateau (LP) has increased significantly, which has been fully recorded. However, the effects on relevant eco-hydrological processes are still unclear. Here, we made an investigation on the changes of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) during 2000-2018 and connected them with vegetation greening and climate change in the LP, based on the remote sensing data with correlation and attribution analysis. Results identified that the average annual ETa on the LP exhibited an obvious increasing trend with the value of 9.11 mm yr(-1), and the annual ETa trend was dominated by the changes of ETa in the third quarter (July, August, and September). The future trend of ETa was predicted by the Hurst exponent. Partial correlation analysis indicated that annual ETa variations in 87.8% regions of the LP were controlled by vegetation greening. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the relative contributions of potential evapotranspiration (ETp), precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to the trend of ETa were 5.7%, -26.3%, and 61.4%, separately. Vegetation greening has a close relationship with the Grain for Green (GFG) project and acts as an essential driver for the long-term development trend of water consumption on the LP. In this research, the potential conflicts of water demanding between the natural ecosystem and social-economic system in the LP were highlighted, which were caused by the fast vegetation expansion.

Previous geometric calibration research has mostly focused on stitched satellite images and has largely ignored the inter-chip relationship among original multi-chip images, resulting in accuracy loss in geometric calibration and subsequent image products. Therefore, in this paper, a novel geometric calibration method is proposed for spliced satellite optical cameras. The integral geometric calibration model was developed on inter-chip geometry constraints among multi-chip images, including the corresponding external and internal calibration models. The proposed approach improves uncontrolled geopositioning accuracy and enhances mosaic precision at the same time. For evaluation, images from the optical butting satellite ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) and mechanical interleaving satellite Tianhui-1 (TH-1) were used for the experiments. Multiple sets of satellite data of the Songshan Calibration field and other regions were used to evaluate the reliability, stability, and applicability of the calibration parameters. The experiment results found that the proposed method obtains reliable camera alignment angles and interior calibration parameters and generates high-precision seamless mosaic images. The calibration scheme is not only suitable for mechanical interleaving cameras with large geometric displacement among multi-chip images but is also effective for optical butting cameras with minor chip offset. It also significantly improves uncontrolled geopositioning accuracy for both types of spliced satellite images. Moreover, the proposed calibration procedure results in multi-chip satellite images being seamlessly stitched together and mosaic errors within one pixel.

TI  - Effects of Spatial Resolution on the Satellite Observation of Floating Macroalgae Blooms
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images with different spatial resolutions are widely used in the observations of floating macroalgae booms in sea surface. In this study, semi-synchronous satellite images with different resolutions (10 m, 16 m, 30 m, 50 m, 100 m, 250 m and 500 m) acquired over the Yellow Sea, are used to quantitatively assess the effects of spatial resolution on the observation of floating macroalgae blooms of Ulva prolifera. Results indicate that the covering area of macroalgae-mixing pixels (MM-CA) detected from high resolution images is smaller than that from low resolution images; however, the area affected by macroalgae blooms (AA) is larger in high resolution images than in low resolution ones. The omission rates in the MM-CA and the AA increase with the decrease of spatial resolution. These results indicate that satellite remote sensing on the basis of low resolution images (especially, 100 m, 250 m, 500 m), would overestimate the covering area of macroalgae while omit the small patches in the affected zones. To reduce the impacts of overestimation and omission, high resolution satellite images are used to show the seasonal changes of macroalgae blooms in 2018 and 2019 in the Yellow Sea.

TI  - Retrieving and Verifying Three-Dimensional Surface Motion Displacement of Mountain Glacier from Sentinel-1 Imagery Using Optimized Method
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The time series study of glacier movement is of special importance for rational management of freshwater resources, studying glacier evolution, understanding mechanism of glacier movement, and assessing disasters caused by glacier movement. In this paper, we put forward an optimization scheme for the shortcomings in the calculation method of using remote sensing to invert the three-dimensional (3D) surface motion displacement of glacier. The optimized method consists of Offset Tracking method, Optimizing the offset tracking results by means of iterative filtering, OT-SBAS technology and Conversion of 3D surface motion displacement of glacier. The Urumqi Glacier No. 1 was selected to test the optimized method. The 3D surface motion displacement of Urumqi Glacier No. 1 was retrieved by using the optimized method based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets from 19 April to 29 August 2018. The distribution of 3D surface velocity of the Urumqi Glacier No. 1 was obtained in time series, and the accuracy of the inversion results was evaluated by using the field measurement data. The results show that the accuracies of the inverted displacements of east branch of Urumqi Glacier No. 1 (UG1E) were about 0.062, 0.063, and 0.152 m in the east, north and vertical directions, and these values for the west branch (UG1W) were 0.015, 0.020 and 0.026 m, respectively. It is indicated that using Sentinel-1 ascending and descending data and using the optimized method to retrieve the 3D surface motion displacement of glacier should satisfy the requirements of inversing the 3D surface motion displacement of high-latitude mountain glaciers in China.

TI  - Optical Property Model for Cirrus Clouds Based on Airborne Multi-Angle Polarization Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an improved remote sensing technique to infer an optimal habit/shape model for ice particles in cirrus clouds using multi-angle polarimetric measurements at 865 nm made by the Airborne Multi-angle SpectroPolarimeter Imager (AirMSPI) instrument. The common method of ice model inference is based on intensity (total reflectivity) measurements, which is generally not applicable to optically thin ice clouds (i.e., cirrus clouds) where single scattering dominates. The new approach is able to infer an ice model in clouds with optical thicknesses smaller than 5. The improvement is made by first assuming the optical thickness retrieved using total reflectivity. Subsequently, the polarized reflectivity is calculated based on look-up tables generated from simulated polarized reflectances computed for cirrus clouds in conjunction with eight ice particle models. The ice particle model that leads to the closest fit to the measurements is regarded as the optimal ice particle model. Additionally, an alternative method is applied that does not consider polarized reflectivity. These two methods are applied to a data sample as a proof-of-concept study where AirMSPI observed a single cirrus layer. In this case study, the hexagonal column aggregate model works for most pixels both with and without considering polarized reflectivities. The retrieval cost function is high when the camera pairs with large zenith angles are included in the retrievals. This result suggests that further studies will be necessary to have a better understanding of all eight selected ice particle models at scattering angles smaller than 100 degrees.

TI  - Identification of Aerosol Pollution Hotspots in Jiangsu Province of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important atmospheric parameter for climate change assessment, human health, and for total ecological situation studies both regionally and globally. This study used 21-year (2000-2020) high-resolution (1 km) Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm-based AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. MAIAC AOD was evaluated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data across three sites (Xuzhou-CUMT, NUIST, and Taihu) located in Jiangsu Province. The study also investigated the spatiotemporal distributions and variations in AOD, with associated trends, and measured the impact of meteorology on AOD in the 13 cities of Jiangsu Province. The evaluation results demonstrated a high correlation (r = 0.867 similar to 0.929) between MAIAC AOD and AERONET data, with lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.130 similar to 0.287) and mean absolute error (MAE = 0.091 similar to 0.198). In addition, the spatial distribution of AOD was higher (>0.60) in most cities except the southeast of Nantong City (AOD < 0.4). Seasonally, higher AOD was seen in summer (>0.70) than in spring, autumn, and winter, whereas monthly AOD peaked in June (>0.9) and had a minimum in December (<0.4) for all the cities. Frequencies of 0.3 <= AOD < 0.4 and 0.4 <= AOD < 0.5 were relatively common, indicating a turbid atmosphere, which may be associated with anthropogenic activities, increased emissions, and changes in meteorological circumstances. Trend analysis showed significant increases in AOD during 2000-2009 for all the cities, perhaps reflecting a booming economy and industrial development, with significant emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and primary aerosols. China's strict air pollution control policies and control of vehicular emissions helped to decrease AOD from 2010 to 2019, enhancing air quality throughout the study area. A notably similar pattern was observed for AOD and meteorological parameters (LST: land surface temperature, WV: water vapor, and P: precipitation), signifying that meteorology plays a role in terms of increasing and decreasing AOD.

TI  - SAR Tomography via Nonlinear Blind Scatterer Separation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Layover separation has been fundamental to many synthetic aperture radar applications, such as building reconstruction and biomass estimation. Retrieving the scattering profile along the mixed dimension (elevation) is typically solved by inversion of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging model, a process known as SAR tomography. This article proposes a nonlinear blind scatterer separation method to retrieve the phase centers of the layovered scatterers, avoiding the computationally expensive tomographic inversion. We demonstrate that conventional linear separation methods, for example, principle component analysis (PCA), can only partially separate the scatterers under good conditions. These methods produce systematic phase bias in the retrieved scatterers due to the nonorthogonality of the scatterersx2019; steering vectors, especially when the intensities of the sources are similar or the number of images is low. The proposed method artificially increases the dimensionality of the data using kernel PCA, hence mitigating the aforementioned limitations. In the processing, the proposed method sequentially deflates the covariance matrix using the estimate of the brightest scatterer from kernel PCA. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over conventional PCA-based methods in various respects. Experiments using TerraSAR-X data show an improvement in height reconstruction accuracy by a factor of one to three, depending on the used number of looks.

TI  - An Adaptive Piecewise Harmonic Analysis Method for Reconstructing Multi-Year Sea Surface Chlorophyll-A Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality remotely sensed satellite data series are important for many ecological and environmental applications. Unfortunately, irregular spatiotemporal samples, frequent image gaps and inevitable observational biases can greatly hinder their application. As one of the most effective gap filling and noise reduction approaches, the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) method has been widely used to reconstruct geographical variables; however, when applied on multi-year time series over large spatial areas, the optimal harmonic formulas are generally varied in different locations or change across different years. The question of how to choose the optimal harmonic formula is still unanswered due to the deficiency of appropriate criteria. In this study, an adaptive piecewise harmonic analysis method (AP-HA) is proposed to reconstruct multi-year seasonal data series. The method introduces a cross-validation scheme to adaptively determine the optimal harmonic model and employs an iterative piecewise scheme to better track the local traits. Whenapplied to the satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll-a time series over the Bohai and Yellow Seas of China, the AP-HA obtains reliable reconstruction results and outperforms the conventional HANTS methods, achieving improved accuracy. Due to its generic approach to filling missing observations and tracking detailed traits, the AP-HA method has a wide range of applications for other seasonal geographical variables.

TI  - An Adaptive Decomposition Approach with Dipole Aggregation Model for Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has attracted lots of attention from remote sensing scientists because of its various advantages, e.g., all-weather, all-time, penetrating capability, and multi-polarimetry. The three-component scattering model proposed by Freeman and Durden (FDD) has bridged the data and observed target with physical scattering model, whose simplicity and practicality have advanced remote sensing applications. However, the three-component scattering model also has some disadvantages, such as negative powers and a scattering model unfitted to observed target, which can be improved by adaptive methods. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive decomposition approach in which we established a dipole aggregation model to fit every pixel in PolSAR image to an independent volume scattering mechanism, resulting in a reduction of negative powers and an improved adaptive capability of decomposition models. Compared with existing adaptive methods, the proposed approach is fast because it does not utilize any time-consuming algorithm of iterative optimization, is simple because it does not complicate the original three-component scattering model, and is clear for each model being fitted to explicit physical meaning, i.e., the determined adaptive parameter responds to the scattering mechanism of observed target. The simulation results indicated that this novel approach reduced the possibility of the occurrence of negative powers. The experiments on ALOS-2 and RADARSAT-2 PolSAR images showed that the increasing of adaptive parameter reflected more effective scatterers aggregating at the 45 degrees direction corresponding to high cross-polarized property, which always appeared in the 45 degrees oriented buildings. Moreover, the random volume scattering model used in the FDD could be expressed by the novel dipole aggregation model with an adaptive parameter equal to one that always appeared in the forest area.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Pattern of Changes in Abandoned Farmland Based on Long Time Series of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid increase in the costs of rural labour and the adjustment of planting structures, the phenomenon of farmland abandonment has appeared in China. It is of great significance to promptly and accurately grasp the information on dynamic temporal and spatial changes in abandoned farmland to ensure national food security and the sustainable use of cultivated land. Luquan District in Hebei, China was selected as the research area based on multispectral images from Sentinel-2A, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8 combined with methods of random forest (RF) classification and vegetation index change detection. Rules for the identification of abandoned farmland were also developed, and remote sensing monitoring of the abandonment status of the cultivated land was also carried out in the study area. We also obtained the spatial distribution of abandoned and reclaimed farmland and analysed the frequency of farmland abandonment. The results show that the overall accuracy of the land-use time-series map ranged from 90.20% to 96.92% for the study period of 2010-2020. The average rate of farmland abandonment in the study area was 10.62%, with the lowest rate (5.83%) in 2020 and the highest (14.09%) in 2012. From 2011 to 2020, the maximum farmland abandonment area was 3906.02 hm(2), and the minimum area was 1618.74 hm(2). The farmland abandonment area showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. From 2012 to 2020, the maximum area of reclaimed farmland was 291.49 hm(2), and the highest rate of reclamation was 14.26%. The overall reclamation rate was low. The abandonment frequency of most of the abandoned farmland was 1-3 years, covering an area of 8193.73 hm(2), which comprised 79% of the total area of abandoned farmland. The frequency of abandonment was inversely proportional to the area of abandoned farmland. Farmland abandonment mainly occurred in hilly areas. We expect that our results can provide case studies for long time series in farmland abandonment research and can provide a reference for studying the driving factors, risk assessment, and policymaking with respect to abandoned farmland.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Analysis of the Ecosystem Services in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery Based on Deep Learning Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of ecosystem services supply, demand, and budgets can help to achieve sustainable urban development. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as one of the most developed megacities in China, sets up a goal of high-quality development while fostering ecosystem services. Therefore, assessing the ecosystem services in this study area is very important to guide further development. However, the spatial pattern of ecosystem services, especially at local scales, is not well understood. Using the available 2017 land cover product, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, a deep learning land cover mapping framework integrating deep change vector analysis and the ResUnet model was proposed. Based on the produced 10 m land cover map for the year 2020, recent spatial patterns of the ecosystem services at different scales (i.e., the GBA, 11 cities, urban-rural gradient, and pixel) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Forest was the primary land cover in Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong, and an impervious surface was the main land cover in the other four cities. (2) Although ecosystem services in the GBA were sufficient to meet their demand, there was undersupply for all the three general services in Macao and for the provision services in Zhongshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Foshan. (3) Along the urban-rural gradient in the GBA, supply and demand capacity showed an increasing and decreasing trend, respectively. As for the city-level analysis, Huizhou and Zhuhai showed a fluctuation pattern while Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong presented a decreasing pattern along the gradient. (4) Inclusion of neighborhood landscape led to increased demand scores in a small proportion of impervious areas and oversupply for a very large percent of bare land.

TI  - Air Quality Improvement during COVID-19 Lockdown in Bangkok Metropolitan, Thailand: Effect of the Long-range Transport of Air Pollutants
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lockdown measures have been adopted in many countries worldwide due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in Thailand. Air quality improvements with regard to restrictions of daily movement among Bangkok people have been reported. This study explores the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and long-range pollution on air quality in Bangkok Metropolitan, Thailand by using ground-based and satellite measurements such as MODIS and TROPOMI data. Moreover, the results project some possible future trends of air quality in Bangkok Metropolitan. The 24-hr average concentrations of PM2.5, O-3, NO2, CO and SO2 were compared between the periods of Normal, Lockdown and New Normal. PM2.5 concentrations increased by 20.56% during the Normal period and decreased by -15.79% and -23.34% during the Lockdown and New Normal periods, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017-2019. There were also significant decreasing trends in O-3: -7.13% and 4.72%; and CO: -8.01% and 23.59% during the Lockdown and New Normal periods, respectively, while NO2 and SO2 concentrations showed increasing trends during the three periods. The MODIS and TROPOMI data analyses indicate the COVID-19 outbreak has had significant positive impact on surface pollution, but no impact on upper atmospheric pollution due to added pollution from long-range transport. The results also demonstrate that surface air pollution had a combination effect from biomass burning, traffic, industrial and household sources during the Lockdown period, except for SO2 concentrations, which were attributed to long-range transport pollution loading. In some cases, a negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution can be observed due to certain activities increasing within Bangkok Metropolitan. Additionally, the results also show that changing the lifestyle into a "new normal" for people in Bangkok after the Lockdown period has had a positive effect on air pollution.

TI  - Novel Protozoans in Austria Revealed through the Use of Dogs as Sentinels for Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We previously isolated and cultivated the novel Rickettsia raoultii strain Jongejan. This prompted us to ask whether this strain is unique or more widely present in Austria. To assess this issue, we retrospectively screened ticks collected from dogs in 2008. Of these collected ticks, we randomly selected 75 (47 females and 28 males) Dermacentor reticulatus, 44 (21 females, 7 males, and 16 nymphs) Haemaphysalis concinna, and 55 (52 females and 3 males) ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex. Subsequently, these ticks were individually screened for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using the reverse line blot hybridization assay. In our current study, we detected DNA from the following microbes in D. reticulatus: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia valaisiana, and R. raoultii, all of which were R. raoultii strain Jongejan. In H. concinna, we found DNA of a Babesia sp., Rickettsia helvetica, and an organism closely related to Theileria capreoli. Lastly, I. ricinus was positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii/Borrelia bavariensis, B. lusitaniae, B. spielmanii, B. valaisiana, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Rickettsia helvetica, Rickettsia monacensis, and Theileria (Babesia) microti DNA. The detection of DNA of the Babesia sp. and an organism closely related to Theileria capreoli, both found in H. concinna ticks, is novel for Austria.

TI  - "The Wife Would Put on a Nice Suit, Hat, and Possibly Gloves': The Misogynistic Identity Politics of Anders Behring Breivik
T2  - FASCISM
M3  - Article
AB  - By analysing the anti-feminist and misogynistic narratives in Anders Behring Breivik's compendium 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, this article argues that Breivik's counterjihadist worldview can be located both as a permutation of 'generic fascism' and as a form of nonegalitarian 'identity politics'. First, the article reframes and reformulates Nancy Fraser's concept of identity politics, as it sets Breivik's ideology in relation to her theory of a 'politics of recognition', arguing that her theories originally developed to analyse left-wing politics - can be used to identify how questions of identity are at the centre of the dynamics of Breivik's far-right ideology. The article then goes on to demonstrate how Breivik's misogynist narratives are plotted into a broader fascist conception of history, where the alleged feminised and Islamised present is described as an estrangement from a glorious past dominated by white, European men. As a result, Breivik's futural palingenetic vision of a 'European cultural renaissance' is not only going to resurrect a white, homogenous, 'Christian' society, but also restore patriarchy.

While directional horizontal strains should be well determined, appropriate solutions for a complete assessment of the terrain surface deformation field are still required. As a result, the presented study examined a new method for calculating horizontal strain tensor based on the decomposition of satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) observations into vertical and azimuth look direction (ALD) displacements. Based on a geometric integral model, we tested our method on experimental data before applying it to an underground copper ore mine in Poland. In the case study, the displacement field was determined using the Multi-Temporal InSAR method on Sentinel-1 data. The model data relative error did not exceed 0.02 at sigma = +/- 0.003. For the case study, land subsidence of up to -167 mm and ALD displacements ranging from -110 mm to +62 mm was obtained, whereas the extreme values of horizontal strains ranged from -0.52 mm/m to +0.36 mm/m at sigma = +/- 0.050 mm/m. Our results demonstrate the high accuracy of the method in determining the horizontal strain tensor. As a result, the approach can broaden the assessment of the environmental impact of land subsidence worldwide.

TI  - Coverage of maternal viral load monitoring during pregnancy in South Africa: Results from the 2019 national Antenatal HIV Sentinel Survey
T2  - HIV MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives South Africa has made remarkable progress in increasing the coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women; however, viral suppression among pregnant women receiving ART is reported to be low. Access to routine viral load testing is crucial to identify women with unsuppressed viral load early in pregnancy and to provide timely intervention to improve viral suppression. This study aimed to determine the coverage of maternal viral load monitoring nationally, focusing on viral load testing, documentation of viral load test results, and viral suppression (viral load < 50 copies/mL). At the time of this study, the first-line regimen for women initiating ART during pregnancy was non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based regimen. Methods Between 1 October and 15 November 2019, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 15- to 49-year-old pregnant women attending antenatal care in 1589 nationally representative public health facilities. Data on ART status, viral load testing and viral load test results were extracted from medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with coverage of viral load testing. Results Of 8112 participants eligible for viral load testing, 81.7% received viral load testing, and 94.1% of the viral load test results were documented in the medical records. Of those who had viral load test results documented, 74.1% were virally suppressed. Women initiated on ART during pregnancy and who received ART for three months had lower coverage of viral load testing (73%) and viral suppression (56.8%) compared with women initiated on ART before pregnancy (82.8% and 76.1%, respectively). Initiating ART during pregnancy rather than before pregnancy was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a viral load test during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-1.8). Conclusions Viral load result documentation was high; viral load testing could be improved especially among women initiating ART during pregnancy. The low viral suppression among women who initiated ART during pregnancy despite receiving ART for three months highlights the importance of enhanced adherence counselling during pregnancy. Our finding supports the WHO recommendation that a Dolutegravir-containing regimen be the preferred regimen for women who are newly initiating ART during pregnancy for more rapid viral suppression.

TI  - Characterization of Each St and Y Genome Chromosome of <i>Roegneria grandis</i> Based on Newly Developed FISH Markers
T2  - CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The genera of the tribe Triticeae (family Poaceae), constituting many economically important plants with abundant genetic resources, carry genomes such as St, H, P, and Y. The genome symbol of Roegneria C. Koch (Triticeae) is StY. The St and Y genomes are crucial in Triticeae, and tetraploid StY species participate extensively in polyploid speciation. Characterization of St and Y nonhomologous chromosomes in StY-genome species could help understand variation in the chromosome structure and differentiation of StY-containing species. However, the high genetic affinity between St and Y genome and the deficiency of a complete set of StY nonhomologous probes limit the identification of St and Y genomes and variation of chromosome structures among Roegneria species. We aimed to identify St- and Y-enhanced repeat clusters and to study whether homoeologous chromosomes between St and Y genomes could be accurately identified due to high affinity. We employed comparative genome analyses to identify St- and Y-enhanced repeat clusters and generated a FISH-based karyotype of R. grandis (Keng), one of the taxonomically controversial StY species, for the first time. We explored 4 novel repeat clusters (StY_34, StY_107, StY_90, and StY_93), which could specifically identify individual St and Y nonhomologous chromosomes. The clusters StY_107 and StY_90 could identify St and Y addition/substitution chromosomes against common wheat genetic backgrounds. The chromosomes V_St, VII_St, I_Y, V_Y, and VII_Y displayed similar probe distribution patterns in the proximal region, indicating that the high affinity between St and Y genome might result from chromosome rearrangements or transposable element insertion among V_St/Y, VII_St/Y, and I_Y chromosomes during allopolyploidization. Our results can be used to employ FISH further to uncover the precise karyotype based on colinearity of Triticeae species by using the wheat karyotype as reference, to analyze diverse populations of the same species to understand the intraspecific structural changes, and to generate the karyotype of different StY-containing species to understand the interspecific chromosome variation.

TI  - Changes in Glacial Meltwater Runoff and Its Response to Climate Change in the Tianshan Region Detected Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tianshan Mountains, known as the "water tower" of Central Asia, are the major source of water for the most part of Xinjiang and oasis region of Central Asia. However, climate warming has amplified the discharges of glacial meltwater in the Tianshan Mountains. In this study, we calculated river discharge by integrating cross-sections mapped using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and water velocity data collected in the field. Multiple remote sensing images, such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery, were applied to estimate the long-term discharge of 19 river sections in ungauged regions of the Tianshan Mountains. River discharge variations under climate change were also examined. Using our in-situ measured discharges as reference, the UAV derived discharge results have an NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) of 0.98, an RMSE (root mean square error) of 8.49 m(3)/s, and an average qualification rate of 80%. The monthly discharge of glacial meltwater-dominated river sections showed an average decrease of 2.46% during 1989-2019. The shrinking and even disappearance of mountain glaciers (approximately -4.98 km(2)/year) was the main reasons for the decrease trend. However, the precipitation-dominated river sections showed an average increase of 2.27% for the same period. The increase in precipitation (approximately 1.93 mm/year) was the key cause for the increase tendency. This study highlights remote sensing hydrological station technology and its application in the long-term prediction of river discharge, which is critical for decision-making regarding integrated water resource management in alpine regions.

TI  - Optimal and robust vegetation mapping in complex environments using multiple satellite imagery: Application to mangroves in Southeast Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A band selection model was described for efficient and accurate remotely-sensed vegetation mapping in cloudy mixed-vegetation areas, demonstrated with an application on mapping mangroves in Southeast Asia (SE Asia). We show how to use multi-source satellite imagery and Cloud Computing Platforms to improve mapping and computational efficiency in complex environments. A key element of the method relies upon field surveys to establish a detailed sample database that includes easily-confused land cover. The Maximal Separability and Information (MSI) model was developed to select key bands for target land cover classification from multiple satellite imagery based on two principles: 1. maximize separability of the target cover from other land cover; and 2. maximize and prioritize information from band combinations. Application of the MSI model to map mangroves in SE Asia using three optical and SAR data systems (Landsat OLI, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1) showed: 1. Sentinel-2 is better at classifying mangrove than Landsat and Sentinel-1; and 2. SWIR, NIR and Red bands (with SWIR in particular) are effective in separating mangrove from other vegetation. The MSI-mapped mangroves showed lower computation cost compared to using all bands from individual satellites, and higher accuracy (above 90%) when applied to SE Asia. It was robust in tolerating smaller sample sizes, thereby demonstrating computational feasibility and substantial improvements with the MSI model for large-scale land cover mapping in complex environments.

TI  - Emerging satellite observations for diurnal cycling of ecosystem processes
T2  - NATURE PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - While diurnal cycling of carbon and water use are critical for plant and ecosystem research, existing polar-orbiting satellites are incapable of providing such measurements. This Perspective evaluates the potential contributions of new satellites and platforms for Earth system models.Diurnal cycling of plant carbon uptake and water use, and their responses to water and heat stresses, provide direct insight into assessing ecosystem productivity, agricultural production and management practices, carbon and water cycles, and feedbacks to the climate. Temperature, light, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture and leaf water potential vary over the course of the day, leading to diurnal variations in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration. Earth observations from polar-orbiting satellites are incapable of studying these diurnal variations. Here, we review the emerging satellite observations that have the potential for studying how plant functioning and ecosystem processes vary over the course of the diurnal cycle. The recently launched ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) provide land surface temperature, evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary production (GPP) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data at different times of day. New generation operational geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8 and the GOES-R series can provide continuous, high-frequency data of land surface temperature, solar radiation, GPP and ET. Future satellite missions such as GeoCarb, TEMPO and Sentinel-4 are also planned to have diurnal sampling capability of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. We explore the unprecedented opportunities for characterizing and understanding how GPP, ET and water use efficiency vary over the course of the day in response to temperature and water stresses, and management practices. We also envision that these emerging observations will revolutionize studies of plant functioning and ecosystem processes in the context of climate change and that these observations and findings can inform agricultural and forest management and lead to improvements in Earth system models and climate projections.

TI  - Gap-Free LST Generation for MODIS/Terra LST Product Using a Random Forest-Based Reconstruction Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial input parameter in the study of land surface water and energy budgets at local and global scales. Because of cloud obstruction, there are many gaps in thermal infrared remote sensing LST products. To fill these gaps, an improved LST reconstruction method for cloud-covered pixels was proposed by building a linking model for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST with other surface variables with a random forest regression method. The accumulated solar radiation from sunrise to satellite overpass collected from the surface solar irradiance product of the Feng Yun-4A geostationary satellite was used to represent the impact of cloud cover on LST. With the proposed method, time-series gap-free LST products were generated for Chongqing City as an example. The visual assessment indicated that the reconstructed gap-free LST images can sufficiently capture the LST spatial pattern associated with surface topography and land cover conditions. Additionally, the validation with in situ observations revealed that the reconstructed cloud-covered LSTs have similar performance as the LSTs on clear-sky days, with the correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.89, respectively. The unbiased root mean squared error was 2.63 K. In general, the validation work confirmed the good performance of this approach and its good potential for regional application.

TI  - The sustainability assessment of CO<sub>2</sub> capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and the conversion of cropland to forestland program (CCFP) in the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) framework towards China's carbon neutrality by 2060
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The global warming induced by the emission of greenhouse gases, especially the carbon dioxide, has become the global climate and environmental issues. China has been working in the CO2 emission reduction and carbon sinks with the purpose of becoming the carbon-neutral country by 2060. The CO2 capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies and the reforestation technology represented by the Conversion of Cropland to Forestland Program (CCFP) have great potential for sinking CO2 emission. However, the trade-off among CCFP, CCS/CCUS and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus are not well evaluated. In this paper, the remote-sensing data are collected and used to evaluate the sustainability of CCFP by analyzing the variation of land use and land cover (LULC), crop production, etc. The results show that 13.29% of the cropland in 2001 vanished and converted to grassland (8.3%), mosaic cropland (3%) and urban land (0.98%) in 2019, demonstrating that the CCFP is successful in both WEF nexus and carbon sink. The total crop production has increased around 50% between 2001 and 2019, implying that the CCFP will not lead to the food risk during the conversion of croplands into other types of land in China. A sustainable implementation of CCFP and other environmental Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) policies in 2019-2060 could reach an estimated total growth of 7.462 billion m(3) in comparison of that in 2018 and the total plantation forest stock of about 10.852 billion m(3) in 2060, with a corresponding minimum CO2 sink of 2.90 billion tons in 2060. The estimated peak of net equivalent CO2 emissions before 2030 is about 11.0 billion tons and could not be reduced to zero by 2060 without the large-scale application of the CCS/CCUS technologies as geological sequestration of CO2. Besides, the application of CCS/CCUS can be beneficial for WEF, e.g., through replacing the water by CO2 during energy production, especially in the shale gas production in the regions with high water risks in China. In one word, CCS/CCUS and CCFP are two decided pathways of carbon sequestration and should be systematically applied to achieve China's carbon neutrality by 2060.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma after liver transplantation: a case report and review of the literature
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of highly aggressive cutaneous malignant neuroendocrine tumor. The incidence of Merkel cell carcinomas is higher in organ transplant recipients than healthy controls. There are some reports of Merkel cell carcinomas after kidney transplantation, but few reports of Merkel cell carcinomas after liver transplantation are available. We present a 64-year-old Chinese woman with an asymptomatic nodule on her right tibia 6 years after liver transplantation. The nodule appeared as a purulent scab on the surface and measured 2.4x2.5 cm in diameter. Histopathologic and immunohistochemistry examinations confirmed the nodule to be a Merkel cell carcinoma. No residual Merkel cell carcinoma was detected at the surgical margins after surgical resection. No metastases were detected in a sentinel lymph node biopsy specimen. The wound was suctioned with negative pressure. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged 16 days after surgery. Then, she underwent postsurgical adjuvant radiotherapy. No relapse was observed for approximately 24 months of follow-up. Merkel cell carcinoma may severely impact health, especially among transplant recipients. Immunosuppressants that must be administered after transplantation can increase the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma and physicians should be aware of Merkel cell carcinomas occurring in liver transplant recipients.

TI  - How Spatial Resolution Affects Forest Phenology and Tree-Species Classification Based on Satellite and Up-Scaled Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of forest tree species provides crucial data for regional forest management and ecological research. Although medium-high spatial resolution remote sensing images are widely used for dynamic monitoring of forest vegetation phenology and species identification, the use of multiresolution images for similar applications remains highly uncertain. Moreover, it is necessary to explore to what extent spectral variation is responsible for the discrepancies in the estimation of forest phenology and classification of various tree species when using up-scaled images. To clarify this situation, we studied the forest area in Harqin Banner in northeast China by using year-round multiple-resolution time-series images (at four spatial resolutions: 4, 10, 16, and 30 m) and eight phenological metrics of four deciduous forest tree species in 2018, to explore potential impacts of relevant results caused by various resolutions. We also investigated the effect of using up-scaled time-series images by comparing the corresponding results that use pixel-aggregation algorithms with the four spatial resolutions. The results indicate that both phenology and classification accuracy of the dominant forest tree species are markedly affected by the spatial resolution of time-series remote sensing data (p < 0.05): the spring phenology of four deciduous forest tree species first rises and then falls as the image resolution varies from 4 to 30 m; similarly, the accuracy of tree species classification increases as the image resolution varies from 4 to 10 m, and then decreases as the image resolution gradually falls to 30 m (p < 0.05). Therefore, there remains a profound discrepancy between the results obtained by up-scaled and actual remote sensing data at the given spatial resolutions (p < 0.05). The results also suggest that combining phenological metrics and time-series NDVI data can be applied to identify the regional dominant tree species across different spatial resolutions, which would help advance the use of multiscale time-series satellite data for forest resource management.

TI  - Surface-Water-Level Changes During 2003-2019 in Australia Revealed by ICESat/ICESat-2 Altimetry and Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-water-level changes reflect Earth's water resource variations (e.g., trends and fluctuations) and they are helpful to understand potential drivers (e.g., climate change and human activities). Currently, Australia is facing serious water crisis owing to rainfall shortage and climate change, and national-scale data set on surface-water-level changes is required for supporting sustainable water resource management. Here, we used all Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+/Operational Land Imager (OLI) data available on Google Earth Engine to obtain annual surface water during 2003-2019 and produced 1506 boundaries of water bodies with areas greater than 1 km2 across Australia. The produced surface water map in Australia is more accurate than the existing global lake databases (e.g., the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database), which can be downloaded for free. Then, 52 water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) with areas larger than 1 km(2) and available Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/ICESat-2) data for more than 5 years were combined to estimate trends in surface water levels in Australia. Across Australia, from 2003 to 2019, the area-weighted mean of water level change rates is -0.046 m/year with 17 lakes (32.7%) with increasing water levels and 35 lakes (67.3%) decreasing with water levels. In detail, the largest lakes (>100 km(2)) dominate the total change trend and most of the largest lakes underwent decreasing trend (-0.046 m/year), whereas the mean water levels of small lakes (<10 km(2)) increased in the past 17 years. In situ water levels of three typical lakes/reservoirs were used to validate our estimation results, which exhibited a very good agreement (R-2 = 0.98).

TI  - Study of Geostatistical Inversion in the Lithologic Distribution and Velocity Modeling of Thick Igneous Rock in the FY Area, Northern Tarim Basin, China
T2  - RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the northern Tarim Basin, a large number of thick igneous rocks are encountered in the drilling process in the Permian. Their lithology and velocity are very strongly, which has a great influence on migration imaging of the "beaded" areas. It is very important to conduct the fine lithology identification and high-precision velocity modeling of the igneous rocks for the exploration and development of the reservoirs. A geostatistical inversion method to obtain the igneous-rock lithologic distribution pattern and velocity modeling in the FY area of the northern Tarim Basin is introduced in this paper. The results show that the application of the geostatistical inversion method greatly improves the resolution of lithology identification. This helps us further understand the Permian igneous rocks distribution in the FY area. Comparison between the seismic facies classification maps of the FY study area shows that the obtained velocity model can reflect the lateral distribution of igneous rocks well. At the same time, the velocity model can reflect the variation of igneous rocks velocity in detail and has a high precision. The average velocity error of the wells participating in the inversion is less than 2%, and the minimum average velocity error is 0.23%. Finally, the velocity model is applied to seismic data processing, and the processing results indicate that it can help to improve seismic migration imaging. The study demonstrates that the geostatistical inversion method can provide a high-precision velocity model for formation pressure prediction and seismic data processing and interpretation, ultimately guiding the exploration and development of oil.

TI  - Multi-Year Mapping of Disturbance and Reclamation Patterns over Tronox's Hillendale Mine, South Africa with DBEST and Google Earth Engine
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was devised to examine the pattern of disturbance and reclamation by Tronox, which instigated a closure process for its Hillendale mine site in South Africa, where they recovered zirconium- and titanium-bearing minerals from 2001 to 2013. Restoring mined-out areas is of great importance in South Africa, with its ominous record of almost 6000 abandoned mines since the 1860s. In 2002, the government enacted the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (No. 28 of 2002) to enforce extracting companies to restore mined-out areas before pursuing closure permits. Thus, the trajectory of the Hillendale mine remains unstudied despite advances in the satellite remote sensing technology that is widely used in this field. Here, we retrieved a collection of Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within the Google Earth Engine and applied the Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) algorithm to examine the progress of vegetation transformation over the Hillendale mine between 2001 and 2019. Our results showed key breakpoints in NDVI, a drop from 2001, reaching the lowest point in 2009-2011, with a marked recovery pattern after 2013 when the restoration program started. We also validated our results using a random forests strategy that separated vegetated and non-vegetated areas with an accuracy exceeding 78%. Overall, our findings are expected to encourage users to replicate this affordable application, particularly in emerging countries with similar cases.

TI  - Effects of Cloud Microphysics on the Vertical Structures of Cloud Radiative Effects over the Tibetan Plateau and the Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Arctic are both cold, fragile, and sensitive to global warming. However, they have very different cloud radiative effects (CRE) and influences on the climate system. In this study, the effects of cloud microphysics on the vertical structures of CRE over the two regions are analyzed and compared by using CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite data and the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model. Results show there is a greater amount of cloud water particles with larger sizes over the TP than over the Arctic, and the supercooled water is found to be more prone to exist over the former than the latter, making shortwave and longwave CRE, as well as the net CRE, much stronger over the TP. Further investigations indicate that the vertical structures of CRE at high altitudes are primarily dominated by cloud ice water, while those at low altitudes are dominated by cloud liquid and mixed-phase water. The liquid and mixed-phase water results in a strong shallow heating (cooling) layer above the cooling (heating) layer in the shortwave (longwave) CRE profiles, respectively.

TI  - Integrating Phenological and Geographical Information with Artificial Intelligence Algorithm to Map Rubber Plantations in Xishuangbanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most natural rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) are grown on plantations, making rubber an important industrial crop. Rubber plantations are also an important source of household income for over 20 million people. The accurate mapping of rubber plantations is important for both local governments and the global market. Remote sensing has been a widely used approach for mapping rubber plantations, typically using optical remote sensing data obtained at the regional scale. Improving the efficiency and accuracy of rubber plantation maps has become a research hotspot in rubber-related literature. To improve the classification efficiency, researchers have combined the phenology, geography, and texture of rubber trees with spectral information. Among these, there are three main classifiers: maximum likelihood, QUEST decision tree, and random forest methods. However, until now, no comparative studies have been conducted for the above three classifiers. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the mapping accuracy based on these three classifiers, using four kinds of data input: Landsat spectral information, phenology-Landsat spectral information, topography-Landsat spectral information, and phenology-topography-Landsat spectral information. We found that the random forest method had the highest mapping accuracy when compared with the maximum likelihood and QUEST decision tree methods. We also found that adding either phenology or topography could improve the mapping accuracy for rubber plantations. When either phenology or topography were added as parameters within the random forest method, the kappa coefficient increased by 5.5% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to the kappa coefficient for the baseline Landsat spectral band data input. The highest accuracy was obtained from the addition of both phenology-topography-Landsat spectral bands to the random forest method, achieving a kappa coefficient of 97%. We therefore mapped rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna using the random forest method, with the addition of phenology and topography information from 1990-2020. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of integrating phenology and topography for mapping rubber plantations. The machine learning approach showed great potential for accurate regional mapping, particularly by incorporating plant habitat and ecological information. We found that during 1990-2020, the total area of rubber plantations had expanded to over three times their former area, while natural forests had lost 17.2% of their former area.

TI  - Cloud-Top Height Comparison from Multi-Satellite Sensors and Ground-Based Cloud Radar over SACOL Site
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-top heights (CTH), as one of the representative variables reflecting cloud macro-physical properties, affect the Earth-atmosphere system through radiation budget, water cycle, and atmospheric circulation. This study compares the CTH from passive- and active-spaceborne sensors with ground-based Ka-band zenith radar (KAZR) observations at the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) site for the period 2013-2019. A series of fundamental statistics on cloud probability in different limited time and areas at the SACOL site reveals that there is an optimal agreement for both cloud frequency and fraction derived from space and surface observations in a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees box area and a 40-min time window. Based on the result, several facets of cloud fraction (CF), cloud overlapping, seasonal variation, and cloud geometrical depth (CGD) are investigated to evaluate the CTH retrieval accuracy of different observing sensors. Analysis shows that the CTH differences between multi-satellite sensors and KAZR decrease with increasing CF and CGD, significantly for passive satellite sensors in non-overlapping clouds. Regarding passive satellite sensors, e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on Terra, and the Advanced Himawari Imager on Himawari-8 (HW8), a greater CTH frequency difference exists between the upper and lower altitude range, and they retrieve lower CTH than KAZR on average. The CTH accuracy of HW8 and MISR are susceptible to inhomogeneous clouds, which can be reduced by controlling the increase of CF. Besides, the CTH from active satellite sensors, e.g., Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on CloudSat, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), agree well with KAZR and are less affected by seasonal variation and inhomogeneous clouds. Only CALIPSO CTH is higher than KAZR CTH, mainly caused by the low-thin clouds, typically in overlapping clouds.

TI  - Missing water from the Qiangtang Basin on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qiangtang Basin is a large endorheic basin in the inner part of the Tibetan Plateau, and has been thought to be a dry region in contrast with the surrounding wet outer region that feeds all the major Asian rivers. Combining surface hydrological data with modeling and satellite data from 2002 to 2016 CE, our study reveals that an enormous amount of water, similar to 54 +/- 4 km(3), is unaccounted for annually in the Qiangtang Basin. The amount of missing water is comparable to the total annual discharge of the Yellow River. Data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission show little increase of local terrestrial water storage. Thus, the missing water must have flowed out of the basin through underground passages. Interpreting this result in the context of recent seismic and geological studies of Tibet, we suggest that a significant amount of meteoric water in the Qiangtang Basin leaks out by way of groundwater flow through deep normal faults and tensional fractures along the nearly north-south rift valleys that are oriented subnormal to and cross the surficial hydrological divide on the southern margin of the basin. Cross-basin groundwater outflow of such a magnitude defies the traditional view of a basin-scale water cycle and leads to a very different picture from the previous hydrological view of the Qiangtang Basin. This finding calls for major rethinking of the regional water balance.

TI  - Using Hybrid Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms for Estimating Soybean Yield and Fresh Biomass Using Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advanced high-throughput field phenotyping combined with sophisticated big data analysis methods have provided plant breeders with unprecedented tools for a better prediction of important agronomic traits, such as yield and fresh biomass (FBIO), at early growth stages. This study aimed to demonstrate the potential use of 35 selected hyperspectral vegetation indices (HVI), collected at the R5 growth stage, for predicting soybean seed yield and FBIO. Two artificial intelligence algorithms, ensemble-bagging (EB) and deep neural network (DNN), were used to predict soybean seed yield and FBIO using HVI. Considering HVI as input variables, the coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.76 and 0.77 for yield and 0.91 and 0.89 for FBIO were obtained using DNN and EB, respectively. In this study, we also used hybrid DNN-SPEA2 to estimate the optimum HVI values in soybeans with maximized yield and FBIO productions. In addition, to identify the most informative HVI in predicting yield and FBIO, the feature recursive elimination wrapper method was used and the top ranking HVI were determined to be associated with red, 670 nm and near-infrared, 800 nm, regions. Overall, this study introduced hybrid DNN-SPEA2 as a robust mathematical tool for optimizing and using informative HVI for estimating soybean seed yield and FBIO at early growth stages, which can be employed by soybean breeders for discriminating superior genotypes in large breeding populations.

TI  - The preventive effect of dexmedetomidine combined with nalbuphine on fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia after nanocarbon laparoscopic hysterectomy
T2  - MATERIALS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explore the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine combined with nalbuphine on fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia after nanocarbon laparoscopic hysterectomy. A total of 172 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and undergoing nanocarbon laparoscopic hysterectomy at Second Hospital of Lanzhou University from February 2017 to October 2019 were selected and divided into a control group (Group C), patients treated with dexmedetomidine (DEX) combined with nalbuphine as the combined group (Group M), the dexmedetomidine group (Group D), and the nalbuphine group (Group N). The imaging and detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes traced by carbon nanoparticles (CNP) was observed and counted, the sedation score and visual analog score (VAS), mechanical pain threshold 24 h before and after the operation, mean arterial pressure (MBP) at each time, heart rate (HR), and adverse reactions were all recorded. The results showed that the total detection rate, sensitivity, and accuracy of CNP tracer sentinel lymph nodes were 97.67%, 90.47%, 95.34%, and 97.67%, respectively. The sentinel and black-stained lymph nodes removed after surgery did not fade. The time of recovery, the HR after intubation, pneumoperitoneum, and extubation in group D were significantly different from the other three groups (P < 0.05). The pain threshold, MBP P < after intubation, and VAS scores at T-0-T-3 were significantly different from those in other groups (P < 0.05); the Ramsay sedation score was higher in group D than T-0-T-2 (P < 0.05); the time of first analgesia, the amount of sufentanil, and the number of analgesic pump compressions in group C were significantly different from those in other groups (P < 0.05). The incidence rate of bradycardia in group D was 48.83%, and that of postoperative chills in group C was 30.23%, which was significantly different from other groups (P < 0.05). Therefore, DEX combined with nalbuphine based on nano-carbon laparoscopic hysterectomy could reduce remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and postoperative side effects, which provided a reference for the prevention of hyperalgesia.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods to Up-Scale Gross Primary Production
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddy covariance observation is an applicable way to obtain accurate and continuous carbon flux at flux tower sites, while remote sensing technology could estimate carbon exchange and carbon storage at regional and global scales effectively. However, it is still challenging to up-scale the field-observed carbon flux to a regional scale, due to the heterogeneity and the unstable air conditions at the land surface. In this paper, gross primary production (GPP) from ground eddy covariance systems were up-scaled to a regional scale by using five machine learning methods (Cubist regression tree, random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and deep belief network). Then, the up-scaled GPP were validated using GPP at flux tower sites, weighted GPP in the footprint, and MODIS GPP products. At last, the sensitivity of the input data (normalized difference vegetation index, fractional vegetation cover, shortwave radiation, relative humidity and air temperature) to the precision of up-scaled GPP was analyzed, and the uncertainty of the machine learning methods was discussed. The results of this paper indicated that machine learning methods had a great potential in up-scaling GPP at flux tower sites. The validation of up-scaled GPP, using five machine learning methods, demonstrated that up-scaled GPP using random forest obtained the highest accuracy.

TI  - Research in Crop Yield Estimation Models on Different Scales Based on Remote Sensing and Crop Growth Model
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security is a guarantee for social harmony, political stability and sustainable development of the economy. However, current research on crop yield estimation is mostly regional and empirical, relying too much on ground-measured data. Scalable Crop Yield Mapping (SCYM) is a satellite data based framework for estimating crop yield. It can be quickly applied to the estimated yield of different spatial scales and different types of crops without relying on measured data. This framework provides an important theoretical basis for multi-scale crop yield estimation research. We took the winter wheat of Anhui Province from 2012 to 2018 as the study object. Firstly, the sensitive parameters determined by the predecessors and their fluctuation ranges in the study area are summarized. Combined with a large amount of site data, the parameters optimization of the WOFOST model was completed. Secondly, random forest models were established based on the simulated yield, simulated leaf area index (LAI) at different periods, and selected meteorological indicators. Finally, the MODIS-LAI under the best observation date combination replaced the simulated LAI for the corresponding time periods to estimate the winter wheat yield in Anhui Province. The main outcomes in this study are as follows: (1) The overall correlation between the estimated outputs and the measured data of the stations is 0. 758 (R-2 is 0. 575), and the RMSE is 790. 92 kg . ha L-1. The sites with higher production accuracy are mainly distributed in the Huaibei Plain (<1%) while the areas with high errors are concentrated in the hilly areas of southern Anhui (>40%). (2) The winter wheat yield in Anhui Province from 2012 to 2018 was estimated by SCYM. According to the spatial distribution of the 7-year average yield estimation, the yield is gradually decreasing from north to south. The high-value areas are located in the Huaibei Plain in northern Anhui, and the low-value areas are distributed in central Anhui and southern Anhui. (3) The average measured yield from 2012 to 2018 is 6 058. 00 kg . ha L-1, while the average yield of the SCYM is 5 984. 95 kg . ha L-1. The correlation between them in the interannual time series is 0. 822, and the RMSE is 189. 96 kg . ha L-1. In seven years, the relative error each year does not exceed 6%. This study shows that the SCYM framework is feasible for estimating winter wheat yield in Anhui Province and has a good effect on yield forecast. This method can improve the regionality and empiricism of the previous crop yield estimation models to a certain extent. Meanwhile, it also solves the shortcomings of computationally intensive methods, which are costly and difficult to popularize. Thus, SCYM has great potential in applying of regional scales, and it will provide an extremely important theoretical basis and practical value for agricultural production in the future.

TI  - Multiscale Semantic Feature Optimization and Fusion Network for Building Extraction Using High-Resolution Aerial Images and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic building extraction has been applied in many domains. It is also a challenging problem because of the complex scenes and multiscale. Deep learning algorithms, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), have shown robust feature extraction ability than traditional remote sensing data processing methods. However, hierarchical features from encoders with a fixed receptive field perform weak ability to obtain global semantic information. Local features in multiscale subregions cannot construct contextual interdependence and correlation, especially for large-scale building areas, which probably causes fragmentary extraction results due to intra-class feature variability. In addition, low-level features have accurate and fine-grained spatial information for tiny building structures but lack refinement and selection, and the semantic gap of across-level features is not conducive to feature fusion. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an FCN framework based on the residual network and provides the training pattern for multi-modal data combining the advantage of high-resolution aerial images and LiDAR data for building extraction. Two novel modules have been proposed for the optimization and integration of multiscale and across-level features. In particular, a multiscale context optimization module is designed to adaptively generate the feature representations for different subregions and effectively aggregate global context. A semantic guided spatial attention mechanism is introduced to refine shallow features and alleviate the semantic gap. Finally, hierarchical features are fused via the feature pyramid network. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, experimental results demonstrate superior performance with 93.19 IoU, 97.56 OA on WHU datasets and 94.72 IoU, 97.84 OA on the Boston dataset, which shows that the proposed network can improve accuracy and achieve better performance for building extraction.

TI  - LSTM Networks to Improve the Prediction of Harmful Algal Blooms in the West Coast of Sabah
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal bloom (HAB) events have alarmed authorities of human health that have caused severe illness and fatalities, death of marine organisms, and massive fish killings. This work aimed to perform the long short-term memory (LSTM) method and convolution neural network (CNN) method to predict the HAB events in the West Coast of Sabah. The results showed that this method could be used to predict satellite time series data in which previous studies only used vector data. This paper also could identify and predict whether there is HAB occurrence in the region. A chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a; mg/L) variable was used as an HAB indicator, where the data were obtained from MODIS and GEBCO bathymetry. The eight-day dataset interval was from January 2003 to December 2018. The results obtained showed that the LSTM model outperformed the CNN model in terms of accuracy using RMSE and the correlation coefficient r as the statistical criteria.

TI  - Comparison of Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks for Post-Disaster Forest Species Mapping of the Krkonose/Karkonosze Transboundary Biosphere Reserve
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain forests are exposed to extreme conditions (e.g., strong winds and intense solar radiation) and various types of damage by insects such as bark beetles, which makes them very sensitive to climatic changes. Therefore, continuous monitoring is crucial, and remote-sensing techniques allow the monitoring of transboundary areas where a common policy is needed to protect and monitor the environment. In this study, we used Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 open data to assess the forest stands classification of the UNESCO Krkonose/Karkonosze Transboundary Biosphere Reserve, which is undergoing dynamic changes in recovering woodland vegetation due to an ecological disaster that led to damage and death of a large portion of the forests. Currently, in this protected area, dry big trunks and branches coexist with naturally occurring young forests. This heterogeneity generates mixes, which hinders the automation of classification. Thus, we used three machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-to classify dominant tree species (birch, beech, larch and spruce). The best results were obtained for the SVM RBF classifier, which offered an average median F1-score that oscillated around 67.2-91.5% depending on the species. The obtained maps, which were based on multispectral satellite images, were also compared with classifications made for the same area on the basis of hyperspectral APEX imagery (288 spectral bands with three-meter resolution), indicating high convergence in the recognition of woody species.

TI  - Superior PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation by Integrating Aerosol Fine Mode Data from the Himawari-8 Satellite in Deep and Classical Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence is widely applied to estimate ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from satellite data by constructing the relationship between the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the surface PM2.5 concentration. However, aerosol size properties, such as the fine mode fraction (FMF), are rarely considered in satellite-based PM2.5 modeling, especially in machine learning models. This study investigated the linear and non-linear relationships between fine mode AOT (fAOT) and PM2.5 over five AERONET stations in China (Beijing, Baotou, Taihu, Xianghe, and Xuzhou) using AERONET fAOT and 5-year (2015-2019) ground-level PM2.5 data. Results showed that the fAOT separated by the FMF (fAOT = AOT x FMF) had significant linear and non-linear relationships with surface PM2.5. Then, the Himawari-8 V3.0 and V2.1 FMF and AOT (FMF&AOT-PM2.5) data were tested as input to a deep learning model and four classical machine learning models. The results showed that FMF&AOT-PM2.5 performed better than AOT (AOT-PM2.5) in modelling PM2.5 estimations. The FMF was then applied in satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval over China during 2020, and FMF&AOT-PM2.5 was found to have a better agreement with ground-level PM2.5 than AOT-PM2.5 on dust and haze days. The better linear correlation between PM2.5 and fAOT on both haze and dust days (dust days: R = 0.82; haze days: R = 0.56) compared to AOT (dust days: R = 0.72; haze days: R = 0.52) partly contributed to the superior accuracy of FMF&AOT-PM2.5. This study demonstrates the importance of including the FMF to improve PM2.5 estimations and emphasizes the need for a more accurate FMF product that enables superior PM2.5 retrieval.

TI  - Assessing Potential Bioenergy Production on Urban Marginal Land in 20 Major Cities of China by the Use of Multi-View High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the purpose of bioenergy production, biomass cropping on marginal land is an appropriate method. Less consideration has been given to estimating the marginal land in cities at a fine spatial resolution, especially in China. Marginal land within cities has great potential for bioenergy production. Therefore, in this research, the urban marginal land of 20 representative cities of China was estimated by using detailed land-cover and 3D building morphology information derived from Ziyuan-3 high-resolution remote sensing imagery, and ancillary geographical data, including land use, soil type, and digital elevation model data. We then classified the urban marginal land into "vacant land" and "land between buildings", and further revealed its landscape patterns. Our results showed that: (1) the suitable marginal land area ranged from 17.78 +/- 1.66 km(2) to 353.48 +/- 54.19 km(2) among the 20 cities; (2) it was estimated that bioethanol production on marginal land could amount to 0.005-0.13 mT, corresponding to bioenergy of 2.1 x 10(13)-4.0 x 10(14) J for one city; (3) from the landscape viewpoint, the marginal landscape pattern tended to be more fragmented in more developed cities. Our results will help urban planners to reclaim unused urban land and develop distributed bioenergy projects at the city scale.

TI  - Continuously Vegetation Greening over Inner Mongolia for the Past Three Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming climate has rapidly altered vegetation growth in drylands, and consequently, has put great pressure on sustainable livelihoods. Various datasets have been applied from local to global scale to study vegetation dynamics and there is a lack of solid comparison among multiple datasets. Note that vegetation growth might shift over time and the greening and browning components over a long-time span might be masked by a linear trend. Here, we aim to monitor the long-term and nonlinear dynamics in vegetation greenness for Inner Mongolia (an important part of dryland Asia). As a useful tool that indicates vegetation greenness, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LAI (Leaf Area Index) integrals derived from the GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI3g and the GIMMS LAI3g products are applied. During the period of 1982-2016, NDVI/LAI integrals have an overall acceptable consistency in characterizing the trends of vegetation greenness, with NDVI large/small integrals and LAI large/small integrals increase at a rate of 0.96, 1.72, 2.23, and 3.13 per decade, respectively. Inner Mongolia experienced a noticeable greening process (71% and 82% greening area in NDVI large/small integrals, 67% and 73% greening area in LAI large/small integrals), despite the fragmentally distributed browning trends in eastern and partial northern Inner Mongolia. As inferred from nonlinear trend analysis, we found the greening process is still prevalent. The browning of eastern Inner Mongolia under the linear analysis was actually transferring from browning to greening, while the greening trend in northern Inner Mongolia was changing to browning. Increased occurrences in the frequency of breakpoints after 1999 suggest that previously stable vegetation ecology is more sensitive to external disturbances such as altered climatic impact and anthropogenic intervention.

TI  - Optimizing the Segmentation of a HighResolution Image by Using a Local Scale Parameter
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation is a critical procedure in object-based identification and classification of remote sensing data. However, optimal scale-parameter selection presents a challenge, given the presence of complex landscapes and uncertain feature changes. This study proposes a local optimal segmentation approach that considers both intersegment heterogeneity and intrasegment homogeneity, uses the standard deviation and local Moran's index to explore each optimal segment across different scale parameters, and combines the optimal segments into a single layer. The optimal segment is measured by using high-spatialresolution images. Results show that our approach outperforms and generates less error than the global optimal segmentation approach. The variety of land cover types or intrasegment homogeneity leads to segment matching with the geo-objects on different scales. Local optimal segmentation demonstrates sensitivity to land cover discrepancy and provides good performance on cross-scale segmentation.

TI  - Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency in the Three-North Region of China Based on Long-Term Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), given by the ratio between organic matter production and water consumption, could be considered as a very important ecological indicator for assessing vegetation system growth conditions by combining organic matter production and water consumption. It is especially important for regional vegetation sustainable management by creating enough organic matter with restricted water supply. Furthermore, proper analysis of WUE is vital for the evaluation and future plans of ecological restoration projects in ecologically fragile regions such as the Three-North region of China. In this study, ecosystem WUE across the Three-North region of China from 2001 to 2017 was obtained, and the variation trends and major influencing factors were also analyzed. The results demonstrated that (1) the average WUE across the Three-North region of China is 0.7376 g center dot C center dot m(-2)center dot mm(-1) with an annual increase of 0.002 g center dot C center dot m(-2)center dot mm(-1)center dot y(-1); (2) the spatiotemporal variation trends of WUE are similar to those of gross primary production (GPP); and (3) in the southeastern parts of the Three-North region, the vegetation conditions are better with sustainable improvements, while in Xinjiang Province, the sustainable degradation areas are widely spread. The results of this research reveal large spatial heterogeneity of WUE, with high WUE mainly in the southeastern region with sufficient precipitation and afforestation programs. For those areas far away from this region, WUE is not satisfactory, suggesting that, for a sustainable vegetation growth, it is important to consider the water supply to maintain suitable vegetation cover. Furthermore, the results of this research are important for future ecological restoration and sustainable management of environment.

TI  - Simulation and Assessment of the Capabilities of Orbita Hyperspectral (OHS) Imagery for Remotely Monitoring Chlorophyll-a in Eutrophic Plateau Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration of eutrophic lakes fluctuates significantly due to the disturbance of wind and anthropogenic activities on the water body. Consequently, estimation of the Chl-a concentration has become an immense challenge. Due to urgent demand and rapid development in high-resolution earth observation systems, it has become crucial to assess hyperspectral satellite imagery capabilities on inland water monitoring. The Orbita hyperspectral (OHS) satellite is the latest hyperspectral sensor with both high spectral and spatial resolution (2.5 nm and 10 m, respectively), which could provide great potential for remotely estimating the concentration of Chl-a for inland waters. However, there are still some deficiencies that are mainly manifested in the Chl-a concentration remote sensing retrieval model assessment and accuracy validation, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation of OHS imagery for inland waters. Therefore, the radiometric performance of OHS imagery for water quality monitoring is evaluated in this study by comparing different atmospheric correction models and the SNR with several remote sensing images. Several crucial findings can be drawn: (1) the three-band model ((1/B15-1/B17)B19) developed by OHS imagery is most suitable for estimating the Chl-a concentration in Dianchi Lake, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 15.55 mu g/L and 16.31%, respectively; (2) the applicability of the FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes) atmospheric correction model for OHS imagery in a eutrophic plateau lake (Dianchi Lake) was better than the 6S (Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) model, and QUAC (Quick Atmospheric Correction) model, as well as the dark pixel method; (3) the SNR of the OHS imagery was similar to that of Hyperion imagery and was significantly higher than SNR of the HSI imagery; (4) the spatial resolution showed slight influence on the SNR of the OHS imagery. The results show that OHS imagery could be applied to remote sensing retrieval of Chl-a in eutrophic plateau lakes and presents a new tool for dynamic hyperspectral monitoring of water quality.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Surface Displacement of the Eastern Beijing Plain, China, Using Ascending and Descending Sentinel-1A/B Images and Leveling Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface displacement is an common environmental geological phenomenon in the Beijing Plain. Research on surface displacement in the Beijing Plain has mainly focused on vertical surface displacement, whereas the horizontal displacement has scarcely been studied. To investigate the 3-D surface displacement in the Beijing Plain, we construct a leveling-constrained multidirectional PS-InSAR 3-D surface displacement estimation method to obtain the 3-D surface displacement information. The results show that the surface displacement in the study area during 2016-2018 was mainly vertical displacement with two main northern and southern subsidence centers; the vertical displacement ranged from -150 mm/year (down) to 5 mm/year (up), and the east-west horizontal displacement ranged from 20 mm/year (east) to 22 mm/year (west). Validation results show that the 3-D surface displacement estimation results agree well with leveling data and GPS data, indicating the reliability of the 3-D surface displacement datasets. The 3-D surface displacement results show that horizontal displacement is obvious in the areas with a large vertical displacement in the eastern Beijing Plain. Additionally, the horizontal displacement is directed toward the center of vertical displacement. The compressive strain is observed close to the centers of vertical displacement, whereas tensile strain occurs far from the centers of vertical displacement. The main cause of the 3-D surface displacement in the study area is the long-term groundwater overexploitation, especially deep groundwater exploitation. The spatial and temporal extents of displacement do not exactly match the locations of the groundwater sinks in different aquifers; instead, geological structures and stratigraphic/lithological conditions may have a combined effect. Moreover, the spatial and temporal distributions of surface displacement are closely related to ground fissure activity, and both influence each other.

TI  - Quad-FPN: A Novel Quad Feature Pyramid Network for SAR Ship Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a fundamental and significant marine mission. It plays an important role in marine traffic control, marine fishery management, and marine rescue. Nevertheless, there are still some challenges hindering accuracy improvements of SAR ship detection, e.g., complex background interferences, multi-scale ship feature differences, and indistinctive small ship features. Therefore, to address these problems, a novel quad feature pyramid network (Quad-FPN) is proposed for SAR ship detection in this paper. Quad-FPN consists of four unique FPNs, i.e., a DEformable COnvolutional FPN (DE-CO-FPN), a Content-Aware Feature Reassembly FPN (CA-FR-FPN), a Path Aggregation Space Attention FPN (PA-SA-FPN), and a Balance Scale Global Attention FPN (BS-GA-FPN). To confirm the effectiveness of each FPN, extensive ablation studies are conducted. We conduct experiments on five open SAR ship detection datasets, i.e., SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD), Gaofen-SSDD, Sentinel-SSDD, SAR-Ship-Dataset, and high-resolution SAR images dataset (HRSID). Qualitative and quantitative experimental results jointly reveal Quad-FPN's optimal SAR ship detection performance compared with the other 12 competitive state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based SAR ship detectors. To confirm the excellent migration application capability of Quad-FPN, the actual ship detection in another two large-scene Sentinel-1 SAR images is conducted. Their satisfactory detection results indicate the practical application value of Quad-FPN in marine surveillance.

TI  - Assessing the Urban Eco-Environmental Quality by the Remote-Sensing Ecological Index: Application to Tianjin, North China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote-sensing ecological index (RSEI), which is built with greenness, moisture, dryness, and heat, has become increasingly recognized for its use in urban eco-environment quality assessment. To improve the reliability of such assessment, we propose a new RSEI-based urban eco-environment quality assessment method where the impact of RSEI indicators on the eco-environment quality and the seasonal change of RSEI are examined and considered. The northern Chinese municipal city of Tianjin was selected as a case study to test the proposed method. Landsat images acquired in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were obtained and processed for three different years (1992, 2005, and 2018) for a multitemporal analysis. Results from the case study show that both the contributions of RSEI indicators to eco-environment quality and RSEI values vary with the season and that such seasonal variability should be considered by normalizing indicator measures differently and using more representative remote-sensing images, respectively. The assessed eco-environment quality of Tianjin was, overall, improving owing to governmental environmental protection measures, but the damage caused by rapid urban expansion and sea reclamation in the Binhai New Area still needs to be noted. It is concluded that our proposed urban eco-environment quality assessment method is viable and can provide a reliable assessment result that helps gain a more accurate understanding of the evolution of the urban eco-environment quality over seasons and years.

TI  - Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica</i> <i>napus</i> L.) Phenology Estimation by Averaged Stokes-Related Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely knowledge of crop phenology assists in planning and/or triggering appropriate farming activities. The multiple Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) technique shows great potential in crop phenology retrieval for its characterizations, such as short revisit time, all-weather monitoring and sensitivity to vegetation structure. This study aims to explore the potential of averaged Stokes-related parameters derived from multiple PolSAR data in oilseed rape phenology identification. In this study, the averaged Stokes-related parameters were first computed by two different wave polarimetric states. Then, the two groups of averaged Stokes-related parameters were generated and applied for analyzing averaged Stokes-related parameter sensitivity to oilseed rape phenology changes. At last, decision tree (DT) algorithms trained using 60% of the data were used for oilseed rape phenological stage classification. Four Stokes parameters (g(0), g(1), g(2) and g(3)) and eight sub parameters (degree of polarization m, entropy H, ellipticity angle chi, orientation angle phi, degree of linear polarization Dolp, degree of circular polarization Docp, linear polarization ratio Lpr and circular polarization ratio Cpr) were extracted from a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset acquired during the whole oilseed rape growth cycle in 2013. Their sensitivities to oilseed rape phenology were analyzed versus five main rape phenology stages. In two groups (two different wave polarimetric states) of this study, g(0), g(1), g(2), g(3), m, H, Dolp and Lpr showed high sensitivity to oilseed rape growth stages while chi, phi, Docp and Cpr showed good performance for phenology classification in previous studies, which were quite noisy during the whole oilseed rape growth circle and showed unobvious sensitivity to the crop's phenology change. The DT algorithms performed well in oilseed rape phenological stage identification. The results were verified at the parcel level with left 40% of the point dataset. Five phenology intervals of oilseed rape were identified with no more than three parameters by simple but robust decision tree algorithm groups. The identified phenology stages agree well with the ground measurements; the overall identification accuracies were 71.18% and 79.71%, respectively. For each growth stage, the best performance occurred at stage S1 with the accuracy of 95.65% for Group 1 and 94.23% for Group 2, and the worst performance occurred at stage S3 and S5 with the values around 60%. Most of the classification errors may resulted from the indistinguishability of S3 and S5 using Stokes-related parameters.

TI  - Assessment of variational method schemes for synthetic aperture radar wind retrieval
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) high spatial resolution sea surface wind retrieval is of great significance for studying atmospheric and ocean processes in the marine coastal area. The wind speed retrieved directly by CMOD geophysical model function is greatly affected by the prior wind direction error. A wind direction error of 30 introduces SAR wind speed uncertainty up to 40%. The variational method (VAR) considers the uncertainty of radar observation and background wind, which can reduce the influence of prior wind direction on the retrieved wind speed. However, different observation errors or geophysical model function choices will form different VAR schemes, which lead to different wind results. Based on Sentinel 1 SAR data and NDBC buoy data, different variational schemes are systematically assessed in this paper. The tests show that when the observation error is 0.1 dB and the geophysical model function is CMOD7, the RMSE of retrieved wind speed is 1.11 m.s(-1), which is the smallest overall. However, other VAR schemes can obtain relatively better retrieval accuracy in a specific wind speed range. The accuracy of retrieved wind speed by each VAR scheme is significantly higher than that of background wind speed and CMOD direct retrieved wind speed, but the retrieved wind direction is not significantly improved compared with the background wind direction. The results can provide a reference for the selection of VAR methods under different application requirements.

TI  - Crop Classification Using MSCDN Classifier and Sparse Auto-Encoders with Non-Negativity Constraints for Multi-Temporal, Quad-Pol SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable crop classification information is a significant data source for agricultural monitoring and food security evaluation research. It is well-known that polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data provides ample information for crop classification. Moreover, multi-temporal PolSAR data can further increase classification accuracies since the crops show different external forms as they grow up. In this paper, we distinguish the crop types with multi-temporal PolSAR data. First, due to the "dimension disaster" of multi-temporal PolSAR data caused by excessive scattering parameters, a neural network of sparse auto-encoder with non-negativity constraint (NC-SAE) was employed to compress the data, yielding efficient features for accurate classification. Second, a novel crop discrimination network with multi-scale features (MSCDN) was constructed to improve the classification performance, which is proved to be superior to the popular classifiers of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The performances of the proposed method were evaluated and compared with the traditional methods by using simulated Sentinel-1 data provided by European Space Agency (ESA). For the final classification results of the proposed method, its overall accuracy and kappa coefficient reaches 99.33% and 99.19%, respectively, which were almost 5% and 6% higher than the CNN method. The classification results indicate that the proposed methodology is promising for practical use in agricultural applications.

TI  - An Automatic Method to Detect Lake Ice Phenology Using MODIS Daily Temperature Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice phenology is a climate-sensitive indicator. However, ground-based monitoring suffers from the limitations of human vision and the difficulty of its implementation in harsh environments. Remote sensing provides great potential to detect lake ice phenology. In this study, a new automated method was developed to extract lake ice phenology parameters by capturing the temporal pattern of the transitional water/ice phase using a parameterized time function. The method is based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily temperature products, which have unique potential for monitoring lake ice cover as a result of providing four observations per day at 1 km spatial resolution from 2002 to 2016. Three seasonally ice-covered lakes with different characteristics in different climate regions were selected to test the method during the period of 2002-2016. The temporal pattern of water/ice transition phase was determined on the basis of unfrozen water cover fraction extracted from the MODIS daily temperature data, and was compared with the MODIS snow and reflectance products and Landsat images. A good agreement with an R-2 of above 0.8 was found when compared with the MODIS snow product. The annual variation of extracted ice phenology dates showed good consistency with the MODIS reflectance and AMSR-E/2 products. The approach was then applied to nine seasonally ice-covered lakes in northern China from 2002 to 2016. The strongest tendency towards a later freeze-up start date was revealed in Lake Qinghai (6.31 days/10 yr) among the lakes in Tibetan plateau, and the break-up start and end dates rapidly shifted towards earlier dates in Lake Hulun (-3.73 days/10 yr; -5.02 days/10 yr). The method is suitable for estimating and monitoring ice phenology on different types of lakes over large scales and has a strong potential to provide valuable information on the responses of ice processes to climate change.

TI  - Seasonal variation in the three-dimensional structures of coastal thermal front off western Guangdong
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal structure and dynamic mechanism of oceanic surface thermal fronts (STFs) along the western Guangdong coast over the northern South China Sea shelf were analyzed using in situ observational data, remote sensing data, and numerical simulations. Both in situ and satellite observations show that the coastal thermal front exhibits substantial seasonal variability, being strongest in winter when it has the greatest extent and strongest sea surface temperature gradient. The winter coastal thermal front begins to appear in November and disappears after the following April. Although runoff water is more plentiful in summer, the front is weak in the western part of Guangdong. The frontal intensity has a significant positive correlation with the coastal wind speed, while the change of temperature gradient after September lags somewhat relative to the alongshore wind. The numerical simulation results accurately reflect the seasonal variation and annual cycle characteristics of the frontal structure in the simulated area. Based on vertical cross-section data, the different frontal lifecycles of the two sides of the Zhujiang (Pearl) River Estuary are analyzed.

TI  - Influence of Channel Center Wavelength Shift of the Hyperspectral Remote Sensor on Red Edge Spectra
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We simulated the reflectance of typical vegetation in the red-edge region before and after the channel center wavelength shift of hyperspectral remote sensors to quantitatively examine the effect of the channel center wavelength shift on the red edge spectra. The results show that the channel center wavelength shift leads to many "spike" and "shake" phenomena in the reflectance curves of the red-edge region, and the reflectance curves in the region without characteristic absorption become unsmooth. Moreover, there is a significant linear relationship between the channel center wavelength shift and the red edge position (REP) error (coefficient of determination R-2 = 99). For a 10 nm hyperspectral remote sensor, when the channel center wavelength shifts are 1 nm, 3 nm, and 5 nm, the maximum errors in red-edge reflectance are 1.46%, 4.49%, and 9.57%, respectively, and the red edge spectra have the obvious "blue shift" phenomenon, with the REP shifting by 0. 75 nm, 2. 60 nm, and 5.52 nm, respectively. The channel center wavelength shift will lead to the pseudo-shift of the red edge or cause the "covering" or "strengthening" effect on the red edge shift induced by vegetation stress, which will directly affect the monitoring accuracy of vegetation stress based on hyperspectral remote sensing data. Channel center wavelength shift is an important source of the red edge shift. Accurate spectral calibration is the important basis of quantitative application related to the red edge spectra of vegetation.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Global Population Exposure Risk of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from 2000-2016
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A high level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has become one of the greatest threats to human health. Based on multi-source remote sensing data, the pollutant population exposure model, accompanied by the Theil-Sen Median and Mann-Kendall methods, was used to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of global population exposure risk of PM2.5 from 2000 to 2016. The population distribution patterns of high-risk exposure areas have been accurately identified; the variation trend and stability of global population exposure risk of PM2.5 have also been analyzed. According to the results, the average concentration of PM2.5 is correlated with the total population. The average concentration of PM2.5 for countries from high to low are Asia (14.7 mu g/m(3)), Africa (8.1 mu g/m(3)), Europe (8.03 mu g/m(3)), South America (5.69 mu g/m(3)), North America (4.41 mu g/m(3)), and Oceania (1.27 mu g/m(3)). In addition, the global average population exposure risk of PM2.5 is decreasing annually. Specifically, China, India, Southeast Asia, and other regions have higher exposure risks. Less developed mountainous regions, cold regions, deserts and tropical rainforest regions have lower exposure risks. Moreover, Oceania, North America, South America and other regions have relatively stable exposure, whereas areas with relatively unstable exposure risk of PM2.5 are mainly concentrated in Asia, India, and eastern China, followed by Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa. Furthermore, Asia has the largest population of all the continents, followed by Africa and Europe. Countries with increased populations are mainly distributed in Africa, whereas the countries with a declining population are mainly distributed in Europe. Based on this, it is important to identify the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and population exposure risk to improve human settlements and environmental risk assessment.

TI  - Evaluation of Five Deep Learning Models for Crop Type Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Time Series Images with Missing Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop type maps play an important role in food security due to their widespread applicability. Optical time series data (TSD) have proven to be significant for crop type mapping. However, filling in missing information due to clouds in optical imagery is always needed, which will increase the workload and the risk of error transmission, especially for imagery with high spatial resolution. The development of optical imagery with high temporal and spatial resolution and the emergence of deep learning algorithms provide solutions to this problem. Although the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gate recurrent unit (GRU) models have been used to classify crop types in previous studies, their ability to identify crop types using optical TSD with missing information needs to be further explored due to their different mechanisms for handling invalid values in TSD. In this research, we designed two groups of experiments to explore the performances and characteristics of the 1D CNN, LSTM, GRU, LSTM-CNN, and GRU-CNN models for crop type mapping using unfilled Sentinel-2 (Sentinel-2) TSD and to discover the differences between unfilled and filled Sentinel-2 TSD based on the same algorithm. A case study was conducted in Hengshui City, China, of which 70.3% is farmland. The results showed that the 1D CNN, LSTM-CNN, and GRU-CNN models achieved acceptable classification accuracies (above 85%) using unfilled TSD, even though the total missing rate of the sample values was 43.5%; these accuracies were higher and more stable than those obtained using filled TSD. Furthermore, the models recalled more samples on crop types with small parcels when using unfilled TSD. Although LSTM and GRU models did not attain accuracies as high as the other three models using unfilled TSD, their results were almost close to those with filled TSD. This research showed that crop types could be identified by deep learning features in Sentinel-2 dense time series images with missing information due to clouds or cloud shadows randomly, which avoided spending a lot of time on missing information reconstruction.

TI  - Pre-Launch Radiometric Characterization of EMI-2 on the GaoFen-5 Series of Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental trace gas monitoring instrument (EMI) is a space-borne imaging spectrometer onboard GaoFen-5, which was launched in May 2018, covering wavelengths in the range of 240-710 nm to measure NO2, O-3, HCHO, and SO2. An advanced EMI-2 instrument with a higher spatial resolution and sufficient signal-to-noise is currently planned for launch on the GaoFen-5(02) satellite in 2021. The EMI-2 instrument bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) is obtained from the absolute irradiance and radiance calibration on-ground. Based on EMI-2 earth and sun optical paths, the key factors of BSDF parameters are introduced. An NIST-calibrated 1000 W FEL quartz tungsten halogen lamp and a 2D turntable are adopted for the absolute irradiance calibration. A large aperture integrating sphere system is used for the absolute radiance calibration. Based on absolute irradiance and radiance calibration functions, the BSDF parameters are obtained, with accuracy of 4.9% for UV1, 4.3% for UV2, 4.1% for VIS1, and 4.2% for VIS2. The on-ground measurement results show that the reflectance spectrum can be calculated from BSDF parameters. On-orbit application of the EMI-2 instrument BSDF are also discussed.

TI  - Associations between polygenic risk score for age at menarche and menopause, reproductive timing, and serum hormone levels in multiple race/ethnic groups
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We assessed associations of genetic loci that contribute to age at menarche and menopause with sentinel menopausal traits in multiple race/ethnic groups. Methods: Genetic data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation include 738 White, 366 Black, 139 Chinese, and 145 Japanese women aged 42 to 52 at baseline. We constructed standardized polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using single nucleotide polymorphisms identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies meta-analyses of ages at menopause and menarche, evaluating associations with each trait within each race/ethnic group. Results: Menopause PRS was significantly associated with age at menopause in White women after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.004) and nominally associated in Chinese and Japanese women (P < 0.05) (7.4-8.5 mo delay for one standard deviation [SD] increase in PRS). Menarche PRS was significantly associated with age at menarche in White (P < 0.004) and nominally associated in Black and Japanese women (P < 0.05) (2.6-4.8 mo delay for one SD increase). In White women, menarche and menopause PRSs were significantly associated (P < 0.004) with shorter and longer (5.9 and 9.6 mo for one SD increase) reproductive lifespans, respectively, and menopause PRS with a longer menopausal transition (7.1 mo for one SD increase). We observed a significant positive association (P < 0.004) between menopause PRS and E2 level 2 years before menopause and a nominal association (P < 0.05) 2 years after menopause in Japanese women. Conclusions: In addition to menopausal timing, PRSs associated with onset and ending of reproductive life were associated with reproductive lifespan, length of the menopausal transition, and E2 levels in different race/ethnic groups.

TI  - Contrasting Evolution Patterns of Endorheic and Exorheic Lakes on the Central Tibetan Plateau and Climate Cause Analysis during 1988-2017
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are indicators of climate change. The assessment of lake dynamics on the TP is an important component of global climate change research. With a focus on lakes in the 33 degrees N zone of the central TP, this study investigates the temporal evolution patterns of the lake areas of different types of lakes, i.e., non-glacier-fed endorheic lakes and non-glacier-fed exorheic lakes, during 1988-2017, and examines their relationship with changes in climatic factors. From 1988 to 2017, two endorheic lakes (Lake Yagenco and Lake Zhamcomaqiong) in the study area expanded significantly, i.e., by more than 50%. Over the same period, two exorheic lakes within the study area also exhibited spatio-temporal variability: Lake Gaeencuonama increased by 5.48%, and the change in Lake Zhamuco was not significant. The 2000s was a period of rapid expansion of both the closed lakes (endorheic lakes) and open lakes (exorheic lakes) in the study area. However, the endorheic lakes maintained the increase in lake area after the period of rapid expansion, while the exorheic lakes decreased after significant expansion. During 1988-2017, the annual mean temperature significantly increased at a rate of 0.04 degrees C/a, while the annual precipitation slightly increased at a rate of 2.23 mm/a. Furthermore, the annual precipitation significantly increased at a rate of 14.28 mm/a during 1995-2008. The results of this study demonstrate that the change in precipitation was responsible for the observed changes in the lake areas of the two exorheic lakes within the study area, while the changes in the lake areas of the two endorheic lakes were more sensitive to the annual mean temperature between 1988 and 2017. Given the importance of lakes to the TP, these are not trivial issues, and we now need accelerated research based on long-term and continuous remote sensing data.

TI  - Effect Analysis of Using Different Polarization Quantities in Aerosol Retrieval From Satellite Observation
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetry is one of the most promising types of remote sensing for improved characterization of atmospheric aerosol. As an important polarization data source in the world currently, the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) onboard Gaof en-5 satellite can provide measurements of the Stokes vector, the polarization radiance (Li,), and degree of linear polarization (DOLP). The calibration accuracy of these polarization quantities will affect the retrieval error of aerosol parameters, and the corresponding impacts need to be analyzed quantitatively. For this purpose, the degree of freedom for signal (DFS) and the posterior error for aerosol model parameters are calculated based on the optimal estimation inversion framework and information content analysis theory. The results show that the information contained in the Stokes vector is the highest, followed by DOLP and L. The corresponding total aerosol DFS are 7. 5, 6. 1, and 5. 2, respectively. The imaginary part of the complex refractive index OnD and the effective variance ( vf,ff) reduce significantly when using Li, in the retrieval. This indicates that the two parameters are sensitive to the polarization direction and measurement error. The average DFS of the fine-mode columnar volume concentration (V0), the real part of the complex refractive index (n14), and the effective radius (r,,,) are larger than 0. 85, which can be well retrieved from DPC multiangle polarization observation. The inversion of coarse-mode aerosol parameters has high uncertainties, which is related to the aerosol type. Compared with adopting the Stokes vector in the retrieval, the posterior error of aerosol parameters increase 67. 6% and 65. 5% on average for adopting Li, and DOLP, respectively. The fine-mode columnar volume concentration (Vfo) and effective radius (rf,ff) are most affected. Evidently, the polarization direction has great value to improve the retrieval of aerosol. Among all the aerosol parameters, the posterior error of the real part of complex refractive index (m4) is the smallest, and the imaginary part OnD has the highest inversion uncertainty.

TI  - Effects of Typhoon Mujigae on the Biogeochemistry and Ecology of a Semi-Enclosed Bay in the Northern South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons frequently induce algal blooms in the open ocean based on the satellite remote sensing data. However, the effects of typhoons on nearshore areas are not fully clarified due to the inaccessibility of in situ sampled data and the low accuracy of satellite data in the nearshore areas. To understand the biogeochemical and ecological changes in semi-enclosed bays under the influence of typhoons, physicochemical parameters and isotopic compositions of surface water were measured in Zhanjiang Bay during the super Typhoon Mujigae and nontyphoon periods. The results show that the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations inside and outside the bay during these two periods were considerably different. During typhoon periods, the positive apparent oxygen utilization and unsaturated dissolved oxygen (DO) values suggested significant biological degradation in Zhanjiang Bay, rather than the algal blooms reported by previous studies. In contrast, during nontyphoon periods, particulate organic matter (POM: POC and PN) was mainly generated by in situ phytoplankton production, as indicated by a low POC/Chl a ratio (<99), low C/N ratio, and positive correlations between PN, POC, and Chl a. Isotopic analysis of the particulate N (PN) and nitrate (NO3-) indicated that the N-15-enriched PN in both periods originally came from sewage-dissolved inorganic N. These results suggest that the typhoon-induced decomposition processes, rather than algal blooms, in this semi-enclosed bay in the northern South China Sea, providing new understanding of the impact of the typhoons on marine biogeochemistry and ecology.

TI  - Evaluation and Calibration of MODIS Near-Infrared Precipitable Water Vapor over China Using GNSS Observations and ERA-5 Reanalysis Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is one of the most important parameters in climatic studies. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a key instrument and can provide spatially continuous precipitable water vapor (PWV) products. This study was focused on the performance evaluation of the MODIS near-infrared PWV product (MOD-NIR-PWV) over China. For a comprehensive assessment of the performance of MOD-NIR-PWV, PWV retrieved from the measurements at the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) stations (i.e., GNSS-PWV) and the ERA5 reanalysis dataset (ERA-PWV) from 2013 to 2018 were used as the reference. To investigate the suitability of using ERA-PWV as the reference for the evaluation, ERA-PWV was compared to the high-accuracy GNSS-PWV at 246 GNSS stations and PWV retrieved from radiosonde observations (RS-PWV) at 78 radiosonde stations over China. The results showed that the mean bias and mean root-mean-square (RMS) of the differences between ERA-PWV and GNSS-PWV across all the stations were 0.5 and 1.7 mm, respectively, and the mean correlation coefficient of the two datasets was above 0.96. The values were 0.4 and 1.9 mm and 0.97, respectively, for the differences between ERA-PWV and RS-PWV. This suggests the suitability of ERA-PWV as the reference for the evaluation of MOD-NIR-PWV. In addition, MOD-NIR-PWV was compared with both GNSS-PWV and ERA-PWV, and their mean bias and mean RMS were 2.9 and 3.8 mm (compared to GNSS-PWV) and 2.1 and 3.0 mm (compared to ERA-PWV), respectively. The positive bias values and the non-normal distribution of the differences between MOD-NIR-PWV and both reference datasets imply that a considerable systematic overestimation of MOD-NIR-PWV over China may exist. To mitigate the systematic bias, ERA-PWV was utilized as the sample data due to its spatial continuities, and a grid-based calibration model was developed based on the annual and semiannual periodicities in the differences between MOD-NIR-PWV and ERA-PWV at each grid point. After applying the calibration model to correct MOD-NIR-PWV, the calibrated MOD-NIR-PWV was compared with ERA-PWV and GNSS-PWV for precision and accuracy analysis, respectively. The comparison showed that the model could significantly improve the precision by 94% and accuracy by 53%, which manifested the effectiveness of the calibration model in improving the performance of MOD-NIR-PWV over China.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach for Estimating the Trophic State of Urban Waters Based on Remote Sensing and Environmental Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of remotely sensed estimates of the trophic state index (TSI) of inland urban water bodies, key environmental factors (water temperature and wind field) were considered during the modelling process. Such environmental factors can be easily measured and display a strong correlation with TSI. Then, a backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) was applied to develop the TSI estimation model using remote sensing and environmental factors. The model was trained and validated using the TSI quantified by five water trophic indicators obtained for the period between 2018 and 2019, and then we selected the most appropriate combination of input variables according to the performance of the BP-NN. Our results demonstrate that the optimal performance can be obtained by combining the water temperature and single-band reflection values of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery as input variables (R-2 = 0.922, RMSE = 3.256, MAPE = 2.494%, and classification accuracy rate = 86.364%). Finally, the spatial and temporal distribution of the aquatic trophic state over four months with different trophic levels was mapped in Gongqingcheng City using the TSI estimation model. In general, the predictive maps based on our proposed model show significant seasonal changes and spatial characteristics in the water trophic state, indicating the possibility of performing cost-effective, RS-based TSI estimation studies on complex urban water bodies elsewhere.

AB  - The increasingly occurrence of flood events claims our capacity to enhance risk reduction and damage mitigation. The current large availability of satellite data constitutes a fundamental resource for disciplines such as fluvial geomorphology and hydrology that exploit the new technologies and techniques to develop innovative approaches for improving flood phenomenon investigation. The present work, extracted from a PhD thesis, describes the application of advanced analyses and data integrations to detect and to monitor flood events. The new data fusion methodologies are tested in various areas, at different spatial and temporal scales, in various surface conditions. The results (flood extent maps, geomorphic index maps, flood inundation maps, etc.) demonstrate the advantage to use complementary information sources and the progress in addressing scientific research towards the production of operational systems.

TI  - Comparison of sand fly trapping approaches for vector surveillance of <i>Leishmania</i> and <i>Bartonella</i> species in ecologically distinct, endemic regions of Peru
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summary Leishmaniasis and human bartonellosis, two neglected tropical diseases, are endemic in Peruvian Andean regions. However, no human bartonellosis cases has been reported in the Amazon jungle where leishmaniasis has high prevalence. The improvement of sand fly trapping methods and identification of putative Leishmania and Bartonella vectors across Andean and Amazonian regions are important steps towards the design of better control strategies and reducing the risk of transmission in endemic areas. In this paper the authors explored the effectiveness of different trap types, based in LED colors and odor attractants, for sand fly collections in endemic areas of leishmaniasis and bartonellosis. Also, we reported for the first time the detection of Bartonella DNA in sand fly species from the Peruvian Amazon jungle, and the first record in Peru of L. (V.) naiffi infecting Lu. hirsuta hirsuta. The information provided by this manuscript will serve as a baseline for future surveillance and intervention studies about sand fly species as potential vectors of Leishmania and Bartonella in highly endemic areas.Background In Peru, the information regarding sand fly vectors of leishmaniasis and bartonellosis in the Amazon region is limited. In this study, we carried out sand fly collections in Peruvian lowland and highland jungle areas using different trap type configurations and screened them for Leishmania and Bartonella DNA. Methodology/Principal findings Phlebotomine sand flies were collected in Peruvian Amazon jungle and inter Andean regions using CDC light trap, UV and color LED traps, Mosquito Magnet trap, BG Sentinel trap, and a Shannon trap placed outside the houses. Leishmania spp. screening was performed by kDNA PCR and confirmed by a nested cytochrome B gene (cytB) PCR. Bartonella spp. screening was performed by ITS PCR and confirmed by citrate synthase gene (gltA). The PCR amplicons were sequenced to identify Leishmania and Bartonella species. UV and Blue LED traps collected the highest average number of sand flies per hour in low jungle; UV, Mosquito Magnet and Shannon traps in high jungle; and Mosquito Magnet in inter Andean region. Leishmania guyanensis in Lutzomyia carrerai carrerai and L. naiffi in Lu. hirsuta hirsuta were identified based on cytB sequencing. Bartonella spp. related to Bartonella bacilliformis in Lu. whitmani, Lu. nevesi, Lu. hirsuta hirsuta and Lu. sherlocki, and a Bartonella sp. related to Candidatus B. rondoniensis in Lu. nevesi and Lu. maranonensis were identified based on gltA gene sequencing. Conclusions/Significance UV, Blue LED, Mosquito Magnet and Shannon traps were more efficient than the BG-Sentinel, Green, and Red LED traps. This is the first report of L. naiffi and of two genotypes of Bartonella spp. related to B. bacilliformis and Candidatus B. rondoniensis infecting sand fly species from the Amazon region in Peru.

TI  - Unwatched Pollution: The Effect of Intermittent Monitoring on Air Quality
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Intermittent monitoring of environmental standards may induce strategic changes in polluting activities. This paper documents local strategic responses to a cyclical, once-every-six-day air quality monitoring schedule under the federal Clean Air Act. Using satellite data of monitored areas, I show that air quality is significantly worse on unmonitored days. This effect is explained by short-term suppression of pollution on monitored days, especially during high-pollution periods when the city's noncompliance risk is high. Cities' use of air quality warnings increases on monitored days, which suggests local governments'role in coordinating emission reductions.

TI  - Analysis of Agronomic Drought in a Highly Anthropogenic Context Based on Satellite Monitoring of Vegetation and Soil Moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to analyze agronomic drought in a highly anthropogenic, semiarid region, the western Mediterranean region. The proposed study is based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) satellite data describing the dynamics of vegetation cover and soil water content through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Water Index (SWI). Two drought indices were analyzed: the Vegetation Anomaly Index (VAI) and the Moisture Anomaly Index (MAI). The dynamics of the VAI were analyzed as a function of land cover deduced from the Copernicus land cover map. The effect of land cover and anthropogenic agricultural activities such as irrigation on the estimation of the drought index VAI was analyzed. The VAI dynamics were very similar for the shrub and forest classes. The contribution of vegetation cover (VAI) was combined with the effect of soil water content (MAI) through a new drought index called the global drought index (GDI) to conduct a global analysis of drought conditions. The implementation of this combination on different test areas in the study region is discussed.

TI  - Spatially Modeling the Synergistic Impacts of Global Warming and Sea-Level Rise on Coral Reefs in the South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and sea-level rise (SLR) induced by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations can cause coral bleaching, death, and submergence of the world's coral reefs. Adopting the GIS and RS methods, we modeled how these two stressors combine to influence the future growth of the atolls and table reefs of three archipelagoes in the South China Sea (SCS), based on geomorphic and ecological zones. A large-scale survey of the coral communities in Xisha Islands in 2014, Dongsha Islands in 2014-2016 and Nansha Islands in 2007 provided zone-specific process datasets on the range of reef accretion rates. Sea surface temperature and extreme (minimum and maximum) SLR data above 1985-2005 levels by 2100 in the SCS were derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) models forced with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Our model projected that: (1) the Xisha Islands and Dongsha Islands may have a better growth status, because the reef flat biotic sparse zone may be recolonized with hard coral and become a biotic dense zone; (2) the southern Nansha Islands reefs have a risk of stopping growing due to their earlier annual bleaching years. The increasing of water depths of these reefs is stronger in the RCP with more emissions. Our approach offers insights into the best-case and worst-case impacts of two global environmental pressures on potential future reef growth under a changing climate.

TI  - Plague Exposure in Mammalian Wildlife Across the Western United States
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Plague is caused by a bacterial pathogen (Yersinia pestis) that can infect a wide range of mammal species, but its presence in wildlife is often underappreciated. Using a large-scale data set (n = 44,857) that details the extent of Y. pestis exposure in wildlife, we document exposure in 18 wildlife species, including coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and black bears (Ursus americanus). Evidence of plague activity is widespread, with seropositive animals detected in every western state in the contiguous United States. Pathogen monitoring systems in wildlife that are both large scale and long-term are rare, yet they open the door for analyses on potential shifts in distribution that have occurred over time because of climate or land use changes. The data generated by these long-term monitoring programs, combined with recent advances in our understanding of pathogen ecology, offer a clearer picture of zoonotic pathogens and the risks they pose.

TI  - Self-Supervised Change Detection in Multiview Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large amount of unlabeled remote sensing acquired from different sources and at different times (defined as multiple views in this article) presents both an opportunity and a challenge for change detection. Recently, many generative model-based methods have been proposed for remote sensing image change detection on such unlabeled data. However, the high diversities in the learned features weaken the discrimination of the relevant change indicators in unsupervised change detection tasks. Moreover, these methods lack research on massive archived images. In this work, a self-supervised change detection approach based on an unlabeled multiview setting is proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by the use of a multiview contrastive loss in the feature alignment between multiview images. In this approach, a pseudo-Siamese network is trained to regress the output between its two branches pretrained in a contrastive way on a large dataset of single-sensor or cross-sensor image pairs. Finally, the feature distance between the outputs of the two branches is used to define a change measure, which can be analyzed by thresholding to get the final binary change map. Experiments are carried out on two single-sensor and three crass-sensor datasets. The proposed approach is compared with other supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art change detection methods. Results demonstrate both improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and the proposed approach narrows the gap between unsupervised and supervised change detection.

TI  - Assessing food availability: A novel approach for the quantitative estimation of the contribution of small farms in regional food systems in Europe
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent findings on the contribution of smallholders to global food production and security challenge the values used in several reports of international organizations. The skewed distribution of the number of farms and the agricultural area by farm size may explain overestimations in small farms' food production. In fact, the highest values found in literature seem to be more strongly correlated to the total number of small farms than to the actual area they cover, suggesting errors in the estimation procedures. Additionally, a significant part of the small farms is not considered in official statistics, thus limiting the use of the data and also leading to underestimations. New efforts are thus needed to develop and apply methodologies to reduce the error and uncertainty of these estimates. In this paper we demonstrate the progress obtained by using a novel approach to provide new and more accurate estimates on the availability of food produced in small farms in 17 European regions (NUTS-3 level) distributed in 8 countries. Our assessment was carried out using two data sets: [1] data on crop area and production for a priori selected key products in each reference region, collected through questionnaires to small producers; [2] remote sensing-based products derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, including crop type maps with ground-truth validation and small-scale farming systems probability maps. To reduce error propagation resulting from self-reported yield estimates, we used robust measures of central tendency based on Tukey's bi-weight function to compute the overall production in small farms in each region, minimizing the effect of outliers. The self-reported yields by small farmers were also compared with national and regional values of productivity per unit area and discussed in light of previous findings. Our results highlight not only the importance of small farms in the European context, but also their diversity in productivity levels. In addition to the novel methodological steps that underlie our study, which involve the combination of remote sensing data with data resulting from field surveys, the approach undertaken allows to better understand the contribution of small farmers to food security in each regional context, and the potential they have to support short food supply chains. Our findings can be key in supporting policy options that aim to enhance food security by reducing the EU footprint through strengthening and diversifying regional food systems.

TI  - Lymphedema after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Who is at Risk?
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the accepted approach to stage the clinically negative axilla. The incidence of lymphedema (LE) after SLNB is about 5%. We hypothesize that patients undergoing axillary excision of >5 lymph nodes (LNs) are at increased risk of developing LE. Methods and Results: A single institution prospective breast cancer database was retrospectively reviewed from January 2013 to December 2017, to identify patients who underwent SLNB and were diagnosed with LE. Inclusion criteria was (1) de novo breast cancer, (2) SLNB in clinically node negative patients, and (3) no preoperative diagnosis LE of an extremity. Exclusion criteria was history of axillary lymph node dissection. Age, body mass index, tumor-node-metastasis status, surgery type, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy were analyzed. Of the 3325 patients identified, 2940 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Median follow-up time was 24 months. Forty-seven (2%) patients were diagnosed with LE, and nine patients (19%) had >5 LNs excised. LE was diagnosed in 3.7% of patients who had >5 LNs excised versus 1.4% of patients with <= 5 LNs excised. Incidence of LE was higher in patients with >5 LNs excision (p = 0.006). Conclusion: Our study showed that patients have a higher likelihood of developing LE when >5 LNs are excised.

TI  - Outcomes of early reoperation in severe pancreatic fistula and/or haemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
T2  - Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Although advances in multidisciplinary management reduce the mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) from medical complications, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and/or postpancreatectomy haemorrhage (PPH) still remain as common morbidities and main causes of mortality. The morbidity of POPF and/or PPH after PD in our centre, Yangon Specialty Hospital, is 18-30% per year. And there are still ongoing disputes regarding management of POPF and/or PPH after PD.Methods: It is a hospital based prospective descriptive study carried out between 2018 January and 2020 April in surgical units at Yangon General Hospital, New Yangon General Hospital and our centre. Total 28 reoperated patients with POPF and/or PPH patients after PD were included in the study. The indications for reoperation in this study were patients with SIRS together with drain amount more than 300 ml/day and/or blood in drain/ NGT with Hb drop ≥ 3 g% or sentinel bleed. Preoperative CECT scan was done if condition was favorable. In this study, demographic distribution, proportion of reoperation, timing of reoperation, types of procedure were also recorded while outcomes of reoperation was emphasized in this eposter.Results: There were 56 patients who suffered from POPF and/or PPH after PD for periampullary carcinoma during this study period. Although reoperation was advised to 34 patients, who met the indications for reoperation, six of them declined operation for various reasons. Therefore, total 28 patients were reoperated (50%). Fig. 1 showed the intraoperative findings of POPF and PPH patient. Median timing of reoperation was 9 days (2-25 days) and 71% were reoperated within 10 days. While external tube wirsungosotmy (Fig. 2) was performed in majority of POPF cases as a damage control surgery, PPH patients ended up with mainly laparotomy and GDA ligation for arrest of haemorrhage because of lack of interventional radiology (IR) support at present. Among reoperated patients, 14 patients (50%) survived and 14 patients (50%) expired. Therefore, overall in-hospital mortality was 50% in reoperated cases. The main cause was multi-organ failure due to severe sepsis. According to the Fig. 3, in-hospital mortality rate of POPF was 16% and that of PPH was 66% while that of POPF and PPH was 80% in this study. Gangl et al. (2011) [1] reported that the combination of pancreatic ﬁstula and severe hemorrhage was a strong predictor of postoperative mortality (relative risk (RR), 22.75). And Tamijmarane et al. (2006) [2] pointed out that patients themselves are in such a moribund condition that their associated mortality rate ranges between 38 and 50%. In addition, it was surprisingly found that all six patients, who needed reoperation, died with conservative management in this study.Conclusions: It is found that reoperation is necessary in patients when it is indicated i.e. mainly clinical based. Early reoperation and damage control surgery is found to have better outcomes in especially POPF patients before organ failure or haemorrhage supervenes. And it is hard to say the accurate timing of reoperation and optimal procedures because this study has some limitations like small sample size, and limited resources for multidisciplinary management. Therefore, further study with larger sample size and optimal resources and management will be necessary for better and more significant results.Fig. 1: Showing intraoperative findings of POPF and PPH.Fig. 2: Showing method of external tube Wirsungostomy insertion.Fig. 3: Outcomes of reoperative management.

TI  - A Machine Learning-based Cloud Detection Algorithm for the Himawari-8 Spectral Image
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud Masking is one of the most essential products for satellite remote sensing and downstream applications. This study develops machine learning-based (ML-based) cloud detection algorithms using spectral observations for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. Collocated active observations from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) are used to provide reference labels for model development and validation. We introduce both daytime and nighttime algorithms that differ according to whether solar band observations are included, and the artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) techniques are adopted for comparison. To eliminate the influences of surface conditions on cloud detection, we introduce three models with different treatments of the surface. Instead of developing independent ML-based algorithms, we add surface variables in a binary way that enhances the ML-based algorithm accuracy by similar to 5%. Validated against CALIOP observations, we find that our daytime RF-based algorithm outperforms the AHI operational algorithm by improving the accuracy of cloudy pixel detection by similar to 5%, while at the same time, reducing misjudgment by similar to 3%. The nighttime model with only infrared observations is also slightly better than the AHI operational product but may tend to overestimate cloudy pixels. Overall, our ML-based algorithms can serve as a reliable method to provide cloud mask results for both daytime and nighttime AHI observations. We furthermore suggest treating the surface with a set of independent variables for future ML-based algorithm development.

TI  - Ecological Security Assessment Based on Remote Sensing and Landscape Ecology Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The various ecological processes of human beings are not only restricted by the landscape pattern on the regional scale but also affect the local and regional landscape together with global climate change. To date, most of the research on ecological security is based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model, while there were a few studies based on the landscape ecology model approach. In addition, there has been little literature focus on the dynamic change process of ecological security, especially the simulation and prediction of the future development trend of ecological security. The purpose of this research is to establish a landscape ecological security evaluation method based on grid division, be aimed at breaking the inherent drawbacks of the administrative region as a unit mode approach, anticipated to better reflect the landscape ecological security status of the study area. A complex framework was constructed by integrating random forest algorithm, Fishnet model, landscape ecology model, and CA-Markov model. Multitemporal remote sensing data were selected as a data source, and land use maps of the study area were obtained through the random forest machine learning algorithm firstly. And then, the study area is divided into 307 grids of 2 kmx2 km using the Fishnet model. Next, the landscape disturbance index, landscape vulnerability index, and landscape loss index are used on the grid scale to establish a landscape ecological security evaluation model. Finally, ecological security assessment of Zhengzhou city was carried out, and the distribution map of the landscape ecological status in 1986, 1996, 2006, 2016, and predicted for 2026 was obtained. The results of the study showed that, as time goes by, the areas with high ecological safety gradually decrease. It is predicted that by 2026, the ecological security level of Zhengzhou will be dominated by lower ecological security areas. The research results can provide basic information and decision support for government agencies and land use planners to ensure responsible and sustainable development of the urban environment and ecology.

TI  - RQCSNet: A deep learning approach to quantized compressed sensing of remote sensing images
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a deep neural network is proposed that can be used to perform a quantized compressed sensing of remote sensing images. This network, dubbed RQCSNet consists of three parts: sensing, nonlinear quantization, and reconstruction. All network's parts are trained simultaneously according to the input data. RQCSNet has fully convolutional architecture, and it can work with different resolutions of the input images without the need for large initial fully connected layers. Furthermore, its structure reduces the blocky artefacts in the final reconstructed images by considering the effects of different image blocks in the reconstruction process. The proposed model has the ability to learn the nonlinear quantization function according to the input data and sending the measured values from the transmitter to the receiver with a fewer bit budget. Also, RQCSNet can learn the compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm without initial image reconstruction (that is usually the first step of reconstruction in other models), which reduces network flops. The results are presented on standard datasets of UCMerced as a remote sensing data that is the main concentration of this article, and as well as the set11 which is a dataset widely used for the benchmark of the state-of-the-art models. The experiments show that RQCSNet has a better performance than existing models in terms of the quality of image reconstruction and time complexity. As a benchmark, our network has a mean PSNR improvement of about 1.2 dB in reconstructed images compared to available techniques, at a measurement rate of 0.25. The effect of adding noise to the quantized measured data from the transmitter to the receiver at the time of transmission is also investigated in this article, and it is shown that the quality of image reconstruction will be robust to the noise once adding a noise layer to the network during training.

TI  - Urban correction of global DEMs using building density for Nairobi, Kenya
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flood models that use Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to simulate extent and depth of flood inundation rely on the accuracy of DEMs for predicting flood events. Despite recent advances in developing vegetation corrected DEMs, the effect of building height and density errors in global DEMs in urban areas are still poorly understood, and their correction remains a challenge. In this research we developed a methodology for building error correction that can be applied to any other case study, where building density data and a local reference DEM data are available. This methodology was applied to Nairobi, Kenya using six global DEMs (SRTM, MERIT, ALOS, NASADEM, TanDEM-X 12 m, and TanDEM-X 90 m DEM). Our results show building error at highest building density varying between 1.25 m and 5.07 m for the DEMs used, with the MERIT DEM showing the smallest vertical height error from the reference DEM. The six DEMs were corrected by deriving a linear relationship between building density and DEM error. Our findings show that the removal of building density error resulted in the improvement of the vertical height accuracy of the global DEMs of up to 45% for MERIT and 40% for ALOS. This methodology was also applied to the Central Business District (CBD) area of Nairobi, characterized by taller buildings and high building density. The error parameters in the CBD area resulted to be between 15 to 45% higher than those of the Nairobi city wide area for the six global DEMs, thus providing further insights into the contribution of building heights to errors in global DEMs. Building height data is still unavailable on a global scale and our results show that global DEMs can be usefully corrected for building density errors in urban areas, even where specific building height data are not available.

TI  - Targeted Axillary Dissection after Chemotherapy: Feasibility Study with Clip and Carbon Dye Tattoo - Neotarget Trial
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary staging in patients with complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is still controversial. Our objective was to test tattoo alone and subsequentially tattoo plus clip as markers in the targeted axillary dissection of ycN0 patients. Methods: Prospective cohort of cT1-T3, cN1 (proven histologically), M0 patients scheduled to receive NAC. Exclusion criteria were lobular histology, prior axillary surgery, and clinical N2/3. In cohort 1 this positive node (Neotarget node) was tattooed at diagnosis. If ycN0, a targeted axillary dissection was performed. After an interim analysis with negative results we changed the protocol in order to do a double marking procedure (Cohort 2): the positive node was clipped at diagnosis and after NAC a tattoo was done before surgery. Results: Thirteen patients in Cohort 1 and 18 patients in Cohort 2. Failure to identify the Neotarget node with multiple nodes retrieved in 9/13 (69%) of Cohort 1 patients. Also in 5/13 (38%) of Cohort 1 patients and 3/18 (17%) of Cohort 2 there was a failure to clearly identify tattooed nodes. In Cohort 2, clip identification by surgical specimen radiography allowed the identification of the tagged node in 17/18 (94,4%) of cases. The concordance between the clipped node and sentinel nodes was 16/18 (89%). Conclusions: The introduction of double marking by clipping the metastatic node and verifying their removal by surgical specimen radiography, using carbon ink as a tracer, allowed the identification of the metastatic node in 94% of cases, with a simple, reproducible, and easy-to-implement targeted axillary dissection procedure.

TI  - Absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in stray cats
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 positive or seropositive owned cats have been reported worldwide. The detection of seropositive stray cats in the proximity of farms of infected minks, coupled with the demonstration of cat-to-cat transmission in experimental settings, raise the question whether stray cats may have an epidemiological role in the COVID-19 pandemic and may act as sentinel for the circulation of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in free roaming cats belonging to colonies located in an area highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and to correlate the results with the positivity rate in people sharing the same area. Interdigital, cutaneous, oropharyngeal, nasal and rectal swabs, as well as blood samples, were collected from 99 cats living in colonies and admitted to our hospital for neutering. This caseload corresponds to the 24.2% of the feline population living in the 25 sampled colonies and to the 5.6% of all the free-roaming registered cats. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in swabs was assessed using real time RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies were assessed using commercially available ELISA kits and confirmed by serum virus neutralization. In people, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate ranged from 3.0% to 5.1% (mean rate: 4.1%) and the seropositive rate from 12.1% to 16.3% (mean rate: 14.2%). Most of the colonies were in urban areas and resident cats had frequent contacts with external cats or people. A COVID-19 positive caretaker was found, whereas all the cats were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and seronegative. Although the negative results cannot exclude previous infections followed by decrease of antibodies, this study suggests that colony cats do not have an important epidemiological role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Further studies on larger caseloads are warranted, also in the light of the emerging new viral variants, on a One Health perspective.

TI  - Soil moisture content estimate with drying process segmentation using shortwave infrared bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) has been widely focused and studied in various fields of research, including atmosphere-land water/energy exchange, drought, and vegetation-related topics. Many indices and models have been proposed to illustrate the reflectance features changing with SMC, and to estimate SMC from the reflectance of narrow bands and broadbands, using lab, field, airborne and satellite data. These methods/indices were mostly developed for all levels of SMCs, from saturated to air-dry; however, we found that a single relationship mapping saturated to air-dry can lead to a false impression of accurate estimation. The inconsistency of a regression relationship between spectral reflectance features and SMCs over the whole drying process results in a low estimation accuracy for relatively low SMCs. In this study, a segmentation method is proposed with the goal of a more accurate SMC estimate. The whole drying process of three soil samples, representing varied soil characteristics, is monitored, and the transition points are determined by evaporation rate change (as stage-1 drying with high SMC and stage-2 drying with low SMC). An index, the shortwave normalized index (SNI), is built for SMC estimation, and the SNI index trend during drying is supported by a radiative transfer-based model. As validated, the SNI index is capable of SMC estimates, and the segmentation method improves estimation accuracy astonishingly compared with current methods.

AB  - Modern lifestyle that is based on ideologies such as consumerism, individualism and materialism has led to overconsumption, mass extinction and climate change in the world and threatens the wellbeing of every member on this planet. An increasing number of studies indicate that mindfulness practice may address the socio-ecological challenges of sustainability through nurturing a non-dualistic worldview, empathy and compassion. This study adopts a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to explore how the philosophy and practice of mindful consumption and the insight of interbeing might contribute to a more connected and conscious community. We include the first-person narratives from a female British teacher-researcher, who used what she had learned from the Plum Village monastery to develop a mindfulness program for elementary school students, parents and teachers in a Thai public school for the past 11 years. Her story unveils the issues regarding different perspectives of mindfulness among various wisdom traditions, and the challenges in teaching and researching mindfulness practice as a foreign lay practitioner in Thailand. We concluded that embracing polysemia and respecting the existence of every human being, animal, plant and mineral of the whole ecosystem is vital for meaningful transformations at individual and societal level.

TI  - Lq-SPB-Net: A Real-Time Deep Network for SAR Imaging and Despeckling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large quantities of sampling data and speckle noise are two serious problems existing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The former puts enormous strain on data measurement, transmission, and storage. The latter deteriorates imaging quality, disturbing the subsequent processing in SAR systems. This study proposes a real-time deep network to address these issues. The proposed network is able to concurrently achieve SAR imaging and despeckling with down-sampled data. Specifically, to fit more diverse imaging regions, we suppose that the noise in the SAR imaging-despeckling observation model follows a universal complex generalized Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, an optimization problem with a convex Lq-norm (q > 1) fidelity term is constructed through the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We employ an L1-norm sparse constraint and a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) projection-based detail preservation constraint to further promote the imaging and speckle reduction capabilities. Then, the complex-valued split Bregman method (CV-SBM) is applied to convert the proposed problem into an equivalent sequence of sub-problems. We devise a computationally efficient solution for the fidelity term-related sub-problem, due to the specific down-sampled strategy in SAR. A substitutive cost function and a CNN structure are introduced to solve the projection-related sub-problem. Finally, the iterative steps of CV-SBM are cast into a deep network-dubbed Lq-split Bregman (SPB)-Net to yield a desirable imaging and despeckling result within a small number of iterations. Numerical experiments based on the real Radarsat-1 data validate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed Lq-SPB-Net in real-time imaging and despeckling with down-sampled data.

TI  - High-Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: A Clinical Review
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Given the rapidly evolving nature of the field, the current state of "high-risk" head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HNcSCC) is poorly characterized. Methods Narrative review of the epidemiology, diagnosis, workup, risk stratification, staging and treatment of high-risk HNcSCC. Results Clinical and pathologic risk factors for adverse HNcSCC outcomes are nuanced (e.g., immunosuppression and perineural invasion). Frequent changes in adverse prognosticators have outpaced population-based registries and the variables they track, restricting our understanding of the epidemiology of HNcSCC and inhibiting control of the disease. Current heterogeneous staging and risk stratification systems are largely derived from institutional data, compromising their external validity. In the absence of staging system consensus, tumor designations such as "high risk" and "advanced" are variably used and insufficiently precise to guide management. Evidence guiding treatment of high-risk HNcSCC with curative intent is also suboptimal. For patients with incurable disease, an array of trials are evaluating the impact of immunotherapy, targeted biologic therapy, and other novel agents. Conclusion Population-based registries that broadly track updated, nuanced, adverse clinicopathologic risk factors, and outcomes are needed to guide development of improved staging systems. Design and development of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in advanced-stage HNcSCC populations are needed to evaluate (1) observation, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or elective neck dissection for management of the cN0 neck, (2) indications for surgery plus adjuvant radiation versus adjuvant chemoradiation, and (3) the role of immunotherapy in treatment with curative intent. Considering these knowledge gaps, the authors explore a potential high-risk HNcSCC treatment framework.

TI  - Mapping flood by the object-based method using backscattering coefficient and interference coherence of Sentinel-1 time series
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The SAR has the ability of all-weather and all-time data acquisition, it can penetrate the cloud and is not affected by extreme weather conditions, and the acquired images have better contrast and rich texture information. This paper aims to investigate the use of an object-oriented classification approach for flood information monitoring in floodplains using backscattering coefficients and interferometric coherence of Sentinel-1 data under time se-ries. Firstly, the backscattering characteristics and interference coherence variation characteristics of SAR time se-ries are used to analyze whether the flood disaster information can be accurately reflected and provide the basis for selecting input classification characteristics of subsequent SAR images. Subsequently, the contribution rate index of the RF model is used to calculate the importance of each index in time series to convert the selected large number of classification features into low dimensional feature space to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the data redundancy. Finally, the SAR image features in each period after multi-scale segmentation and feature selection are jointly used as the input features of RF classification to extract and segment the water in the study area to monitor floods' spatial distribution and dynamic characteristics. The results showed that the various attributes of backscatter coefficients and interferometric coherence under time series could accu-rately correspond with the actual flood risk, and the combined use of backscattering coefficient and interferomet-ric coherence for flood extraction can significantly improve the accuracy of flood information extraction. Overall, the object-based random forest method using the backscattering coefficient and interference coherence of Sentinel-1 time series for flood extraction advances our understanding of flooding's temporal and spatial dynam-ics, essential for the timely adoption of adaptation and mitigation strategies for loss reduction.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of chickpea crop in arid environment by comparing high-resolution UAV image and LANDSAT imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data play an essential role in environmental analysis and crop management. The arid agriculture region of Thal, Pakistan, is the major chickpea-growing region of the world. It was important to analyze the chickpea growth rate and yield with modern growing technology for better production in the changing climate. This study compared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat imagery to monitor the crop growth and environmental parameters throughout the growing season. Twelve plots (2 x 2 m) were established in the field to monitor seven environmental parameters (plant height, number of pods and plant density, and final yield) for chickpea crop growth. A UAV drone mounted with Zenmuse X3 camera with four spectral was flown over the chickpea field on a biweekly basis to capture images with a spatial resolution of 1.86 m. The Landsat imagery (30 m spatial resolution) was also obtained, having the same UAV flight date. In spatio-temporal analysis, various vegetation indices, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), were derived from UAV and Landsat imageries. The environmental impact parameters for crop growth were compared with the estimated final yield of chickpea crop. A coefficient of correlation (r(2) = 0.67; p <= 0.05) between observed chickpea crop yield and UAV-derived SAVI was significant (p <= 0.05). In comparison, a non-significant coefficient (r(2) = 0.21; p >= 0.05) was found between NDVI derived from Landsat imagery with yield. The chickpea crop yield was analyzed by estimating simple linear regression between NDVI and actual yield of chickpea crop during 30-40 days before the harvesting period. The average difference between actual yield and predicted yield through SAVI-D and NDVI-L was 558.42, 553.12, 556.84 kg/ha, respectively.

TI  - A Functional Variant on 9p21.3 Related to Glioma Risk Affects Enhancer Activity and Modulates Expression of <i>CDKN2B-AS1</i>
T2  - HUMAN MUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs associated with glioma risk on 9p21.3, but biological mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that a functional SNP on 9p21.3 affects activity of an enhancer, causing altered expression of nearby genes. We considered all SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the 9p21.3 sentinel SNP rs634537 that mapped to putative enhancers. An enhancer containing rs1537372 exhibited allele-specific effects on luciferase activity. Deletion of this enhancer in GBM cell lines correlated with decreased expression of CDKN2B-AS1. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis using non-diseased brain samples showed rs1537372 to be a consistently significant eQTL for CDKN2B-AS1. Additionally, our analysis of Hi-C data generated in neural progenitor cells showed that the bait region containing rs1537372 interacted with the CDKN2B-AS1 promoter. These data suggest rs1537372, a SNP at the 9p21.3 risk locus, is a functional variant that modulates expression of CDKN2B-AS1.

TI  - Potential distribution models from two highly endemic species of subterranean rodents of Argentina: which environmental variables have better performance in highly specialized species?
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - South American rodents of the genus Ctenomys (tuco-tucos) occupy the underground environment, present high specificity to loose and friable soils and have restricted mobility, with a generally fragmented distribution. We use species distribution models (SDMs) in two Ctenomys species from the Atlantic coast and continental areas of Argentina. We develop SDMs using Maxent software for Ctenomys australis and Ctenomys talarum, which coexist in a narrow coastal landscape with restricted distributions. We model the potential distributions of both species using, first, bioclimatic variables (Group 1), and second, Landsat 8 bands and granulometric layers (Group 2). According to the known distributions of the species, the Group 2 variables showed the greatest accuracy for inferring their potential distributions. The most important variables for predicting habitat suitability were, primarily, the majority of granulometric variables and some Landsat 8 bands such as the bands 4 and 5, related to the vegetation cover. We also analyze the level of overlapping niches between these two species, and we found that there is a certain degree of geographical overlap between them, and also present ecologically similar niches, despite the fact that the characteristics of their habitats differ in certain aspects. We conclude that in tuco-tucos species, their potential distributions are better predicted by variables that consider the particular characteristics of soils and cover vegetation, since they are specialized species of substrates. Also, a higher spatial resolution allows a better performance of the Ctenomys species models, which was expected for species with restricted distributions.

TI  - Assessing the effects of georeferencing error in a vertical comparison study of GDEMs on a local scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global digital elevation models (GDEMs) are one of the most important sources of elevation data. Like other spatial datasets, GDEMs are inevitably affected by various types of errors in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. One of the main sources of horizontal errors is georeferencing error which in steep areas intensifies the vertical error. Since horizontal and vertical errors are interwoven with one another, any error introduced in horizontal dimension influences its vertical counterpart. In this paper, for the first time, we intend to answer this question: to what extent the impact of georeferencing error is really important in vertical accuracy of GDEMs and their vertical comparison. Hence, the main purposes of this study are evaluation of georeferencing effects on (i) the vertical accuracy of GDEMs and (ii) vertical comparison between GDEMs. In this regard, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) GDEMs over three different study areas (BumeHen, TazehAbad and Sainte-Maxime regions) were used and assessed. In order to assess the effects of georeferencing error on GDEMs accuracy, studies were conducted in two general categories, namely Local to Global (LG) and Global to Global (GG). In the first category, these effects were studied on vertical and horizontal differences of ASTER, AW3D30, and SRTM GDEMs with their corresponding reference DEMs (REFDEMs). In the second category, these effects were assessed on vertical and horizontal differences of ASTER and SRTM GDEMs with AW3D30 GDEM. To this end, prior to making GDEMs georeferencing consistent, they were vertically assessed. For the sake of consistency of GDEMs georeferencing, a registration process was performed and then, the registered GDEMs were vertically and horizontally assessed. After the registration process, in the first category, 4.4%, 13%, and 3.3% and in the second category 2.3%, 5%, and 1.2% improvement occurred on average root mean square error (RMSE) over all GDEMs for BumeHen, TazehAbad and Sainte-Maxime regions, respectively. These results refer to the fact that GDEM registration always increases their vertical accuracy, which is in fact originated from the improvement in GDEM georeferencing consistency. Experimental results also indicate that the improvement rate of vertical errors after the DEM registration process is directly related to terrain slope angle. From another perspective, we illustrated that in general the amounts of achieved improvements in GDEMs vertical accuracy are much smaller than their nominal accuracies. Finally, our results show that the effect of horizontal error on vertical comparison between GDEMs is unavoidable, but this amount of error can be ignored because the ratio of improvements occurred in the GDEMs with respect to their nominal accuracies is very low.

AB  - Shorelines are one of the most important land surface phenomena with a dynamic nature. Coastal monitoring is an important parameter in sustainable development and environmental protection. Coastal monitoring requires the extraction of shorelines at different times. Nowadays, remote sensing data are considered the most efficient source of information for the study and interpretation of coastal landforms, tidal levels and changes of shoreline and water depth. The main objectives of studying the shoreline from Charak port to Aftab port are to provide a map to calculate shoreline changes, determine erosion and accretion areas and the extent of shoreline advance and retreat to better coastal management. Furthermore, design and construction of suitable coastal facilities, determining the safe margin and ultimately realizing the 14th principle of sustainable development, are other objectives. The case study in this paper is to extract the shoreline of Charak port to Aftab port in the Persian Gulf using five Landsat satellite imageries from 1998 to 2017. For this purpose, in the first stage by applying radiometric, atmospheric and noise reduction corrections and in the second stage by taking training samples of each imagery and also supervised classification methods (SVM and maximum likelihood methods), the boundary between "water" and "land" was specified in each image. Then, the accuracy of each classification method was evaluated using two parameters of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The results of image classification methods show that the SVM and maximum likelihood methods have a high accuracy in separating the boundary between water and land. Nevertheless, the SVM method has a higher accuracy than the maximum likelihood method. In these two methods, the minimum and maximum differences in overall accuracy are 0.06 and 0.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the minimum and maximum differences in kappa coefficient are 0.0016 and 0.0117, respectively. Finally, these imageries were transferred to ArcGIS software and shorelines were extracted and beach maps were prepared at a scale of 1: 50,000.

TI  - Estimation of daily global solar radiation based on MODIS satellite measurements: The case study of Adrar region (Algeria)
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In solar energy studies, solar irradiance data at a given site are a fundamental input for reliably predicting performance behavior and the potential of solar applications. Unfortunately, this parameter is not measured in many parts of the world, especially in developing nations, because of the lack of measuring facilities. In this paper, an alternative method for resource assessment is proposed and evaluated. In the proposed method, a model satellite-derived solar irradiance technique was implemented to estimate daily global solar irradiance using satellite earth observation data, particularly products derived from NASA's MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The estimation results were validated with the observed data collected in the Renewable Energy Research Unit in the Saharan Region of Adrar (URERMS) over a three-year period. The effects of cloud cover and solar zenith angle on the daily mean global solar irradiance are studied. The accuracy of the model is evaluated with various statistical parameters (RMSE, R, MBE, MAE). The results show that the correlation between the estimated and measured values of global solar irradiance is significant, and the effect of cloud and solar zenith angle on the estimation is confirmed.

TI  - Development and validation of an automated emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system to enhance public health surveillance in Yukon: a lower-resourced and remote setting
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAutomated Emergency Department syndromic surveillance systems (ED-SyS) are useful tools in routine surveillance activities and during mass gathering events to rapidly detect public health threats. To improve the existing surveillance infrastructure in a lower-resourced rural/remote setting and enhance monitoring during an upcoming mass gathering event, an automated low-cost and low-resources ED-SyS was developed and validated in Yukon, Canada.MethodsSyndromes of interest were identified in consultation with the local public health authorities. For each syndrome, case definitions were developed using published resources and expert elicitation. Natural language processing algorithms were then written using Stata LP 15.1 (Texas, USA) to detect syndromic cases from three different fields (e.g., triage notes; chief complaint; discharge diagnosis), comprising of free-text and standardized codes. Validation was conducted using data from 19,082 visits between October 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) records were used as a reference for the inclusion of International Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) diagnosis codes. The automatic identification of cases was then manually validated by two raters and results were used to calculate positive predicted values for each syndrome and identify improvements to the detection algorithms.ResultsA daily secure file transfer of Yukon's Meditech ED-Tracker system data and an aberration detection plan was set up. A total of six syndromes were originally identified for the syndromic surveillance system (e.g., Gastrointestinal, Influenza-like-Illness, Mumps, Neurological Infections, Rash, Respiratory), with an additional syndrome added to assist in detecting potential cases of COVID-19. The positive predictive value for the automated detection of each syndrome ranged from 48.8-89.5% to 62.5-94.1% after implementing improvements identified during validation. As expected, no records were flagged for COVID-19 from our validation dataset.ConclusionsThe development and validation of automated ED-SyS in lower-resourced settings can be achieved without sophisticated platforms, intensive resources, time or costs. Validation is an important step for measuring the accuracy of syndromic surveillance, and ensuring it performs adequately in a local context. The use of three different fields and integration of both free-text and structured fields improved case detection.

TI  - Impacts of groundwater and climate variability on terrestrial groundwater dependent ecosystems: a review of geospatial assessment approaches and challenges and possible future research directions
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Terrestrial groundwater dependent vegetation (TGDV) are crucial ecosystems which provide important goods and services such as carbon sequestration, habitat, water purification and aesthetic benefits in semi-arid environments. Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts on surface water resources have led to increased competing claims on groundwater resources to meet an exponential water demand for environmental needs, agricultural and developmental needs. This has led to the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources, resulting in groundwater table declines, threatening the sustainability of TGDV. It is on this premise that the review aims to provide a detailed overview on the progress in remote sensing of TGDV. More specifically, the paper provides a background on TGDV and threats, and then further explores recent knowledge on vegetation response to groundwater variability and climate change impacts on TGDV. This review also focuses on recent progress in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques for mapping and monitoring of TGDV and explores the available satellite products and delineation techniques. Finally, the challenges of remote sensing and future research direction are explored. To date, research on TGDV has gained considerable interest with the year 2020 resulting in the most scientific journal publications. Of significant importance is an increase in studies integrating field measurements, model-based techniques with remotely sensed estimates. Despite this progress, only 0.06% of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) research has utilized remote sensing techniques in the past 20 years, with the top three publishing countries namely, Australia, USA, and China. The literature reveals that TDGV are highly heterogenous, complex ecosystems with unique responses to varying groundwater levels. The vegetation responses differ with the landscape, vegetation type, and seasonality at specific groundwater table thresholds. Despite significant progress in TGDV scientific research, further remote sensing studies are required to understand the annual and inter-annual vegetation response to groundwater variability at local scales. Further, climate impacts are difficult to discriminate from other influences such as disturbances, management, and anthropogenic activities. Moreover, new generation remote sensing products integrated with machine learning techniques have the potential to improve TGDV delineation. Despite these challenges, the development of cloud computing technologies such as google earth engine (GEE) and artificial intelligence (AI) provide advanced computer-processing capabilities for long-term monitoring and integration of multi-source datasets required to capture the effects of climate and groundwater variability on TGDV.

TI  - Time series analysis of automated surface water extraction and thermal pattern variation over the Betwa river, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand-dominated rivers undergo a temporal change in surface water extent and in the supply of the water during the year. These rivers are mainly recharged through precipitation, which showcases their vulnerability to climate-change-induced aridification. Accurately detecting the surface water spread of the river is very significant for understanding and preserving the ecosystem dependent on the river. The majority of the passive optical satellite sensors are incongruous for continuous periodic monitoring because of the cloud cover issue. However, the microwave satellites such as Sentinel-1 can produce cloud-free images, and the imageries are available for free to the users. In this study, inundated pixel fluctuation has been analysed for Betwa river, India, over a selected stretch for the time period ranging from September 2016 to July 2020 with the aim of managing and protecting the aquatic life of the river. The river for the study stretch has been divided into five segments. Segment 1 has the highest number of inundated water pixels, and segment 2 has the lowest. Air and water temperature pattern have also been studied, and they follow the same pattern almost for the entire study period. Precipitation mostly happens from the month of July to September for all the years under consideration. The Google Earth Engine cloud processing system has been used to process and analyze the optical and microwave satellite datasets. The multi-Otsu thresholding algorithm has been applied for the automated extraction of the surface water cover. VV (Vertical transmit and Vertical receive) polarisation has shown the best result for water extraction. The validation of the results has been done by comparing it with the MNDWI (Modified Normalised Difference Water Index) generated from the Sentinel-2 multispectral images. The results indicate an accuracy of 90.4% (mean overall accuracy). In addition to the water extraction analysis, the temporal thermal pattern of the river has also been studied based on LANDSAT-8 thermal bands. The gridded GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) datasets along with ERA 5 datasets have also been used in this study. The multi-Otsu-based local thresholding technique applied on each timestamp of the time series has proven to be highly accurate in extracting the surface water mask for the time period September 2016 to July 2020, highlighting the river water dynamics for each segment of the study stretch.

TI  - The prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use across trauma-exposed occupations: A meta-analysis and meta-regression
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Trauma exposure is associated with hazardous and/or harmful alcohol use. Occupational groups frequently exposed to trauma may be at risk of alcohol harm. This meta-analysis determined the prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use across trauma-exposed occupations and meta-regressions explored the impact of pre-defined covariates on the variance in prevalence estimates. Method: Literature was searched from 2000 to March 2020, using Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they used a standardized measure of alcohol use (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT)). Studies were excluded if they measured alcohol use following an isolated sentinel event (e.g., 9/11). The following occupations were included: first responders, health care workers, Armed Forces, war journalists and train drivers. Results: 1882 studies were identified; 55 studies were eligible. The pooled prevalence of hazardous use was 22% (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]: 17%-27%) and 11% (95% CI: 8%-14%) for harmful use. Hazardous alcohol use was significantly lower in health care workers (13%; 95% CI: 10%-16%) than first responders (26%; 95% CI: 20%-32%) and Armed Forces (34%; 95% CI: 18%-52%). There was marked heterogeneity across studies and higher prevalence rates in low-quality studies. The meta-regression identified higher proportion of males and younger mean age as predictors of variance. Conclusions: Male-dominated occupations, such as police officers and military personnel, showed higher levels of hazardous and harmful alcohol use, indicating that interventions tailored specifically for these occupational groups may be needed.

TI  - Monitoring crop growth using a canopy structure dynamic model and time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data are used by agricultural agencies for many essential operational crop monitoring programmes. But optical sensors often miss key growth stages due to cloud cover interference, impacting the performance of operational activities. Although the synergistic use of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery can provide time series data, any SAR-optical integration necessitates building a relationship between these two data sources. The objective of this study was to use a semi-empirical Canopy Structure Dynamics Model (CSDM), Growing Degree Days (GDD), and SAR parameters calibrated to optical NDVI to derive daily estimates of canola crop condition over an entire growing season. RADARSAT-2 Fine Quad-pol and RapidEye images were collected over three years for a study site in western Canada. Object-based image analysis was applied to study the relationship between the optical and SAR time series data. Significant correlations were documented between a number of SAR parameters and optical NDVI, specifically a ratio of backscatter intensities (HH-HV)/(HH+HV), a ratio of volume to surface scattering extracted from the Freeman Durden decomposition, and Entropy from the Cloude-Pottier decomposition. Correlations (r-values) between these SAR parameters and optical NDVI ranged from 0.63 to 0.84 for the three years of data. Based on this analysis, a simple statistical model was used to relate SAR parameters to optical NDVI, creating a SAR-calibrated NDVI (SAR(cal)-NDVI). A CSDM was fit to the SAR(cal)-NDVI for each canola field, constructing a temporal vegetation index curve which captured canopy development from emergence to senescence. Coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.87 0.86 and 0.82 for entropy, the volume-surface scattering ratio, and the ratio of backscatter intensities (HH-HV)/(HH+HV), respectively, demonstrating a good model fit. The CSDM describes well the temporal evolution of SAR(cal)-NDVI. Using the CSDM, SAR(cal)-NDVI and GDD, the canola condition can be estimated for any given day in the growing season. In fact when the CSDM was used to estimate SAR(cal)-NDVI for the exact days of RapidEye acquisitions, correlations with optically derived NDVI were high. The strongest correlations with RapidEye NDVI were reported for the volume-surface scattering ratio (R-2 of 0.69 and RMSE of 0.15). The SAR(cal)-NDVI estimated from the CSDM was also physically meaningful. Field-based biomass was significantly correlated (R-2 of 0.79) with the SAR(cal)-NDVI calculated using the volume-surface scattering ratio. Although further research is needed to extend this method to other crops, these results demonstrate that SAR data can be used to estimate vegetation conditions and when coupled with a CSDM, integrated into current monitoring operations based on optical NDVI. As a next step, the research team will be assessing SAR(cal)-NDVI in a national operational programme which reports on crop yields using modelling with optical-based NDVI.

TI  - An improved remote sensing based approach for predicting actual Evapotranspiration by integrating LiDAR
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially distributed information of actual Evapotranspiration (ET) is essentially required for various applications in agriculture, as well as studies related to water balance. An Energy Balance model that uses optical and thermal remote sensing datasets is appropriate for the spatially distributed estimation of ET, which is primarily controlled by local environmental conditions. In this study, we use the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), which is an Energy Balance model, to estimate an improved actual ET, by integrating canopy height information obtained from ICESat/GLAS, the first space-borne LiDAR satellite. Our model estimates latent heat flux (LE) as a residual of energy balance, while sensible heat flux (H) is estimated based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The spatial variability of H and LE estimated from Landsat TM/ETM+ images were compared with eddy covariance (EC) based in situ flux tower observations, in order to document the SEBS model uncertainties in three forest sites in the East and Southeast Asian ecosystem. We identified that canopy height (h(c)) is one of the critical parameters that can induce uncertainties in SEBS model estimations. Therefore, h(c) obtained from LiDAR was introduced in parameterization of the roughness length for momentum transfer (z(0m)). In situ based h(c) obtained from flux tower stations, and the normalized difference vegetation index based formulation of h(c) proposed by Su (2001), were also introduced in the SEBS z(0m) parameterization. Root mean square error of LiDAR integrated SEBS (SEBSLiDar) for estimated H values reduced by (20, 45, and 23)% compared to Landsat integrated SEBS (SEBSLandsat), and (18, 7, and 9)% com-pared to In situ integrated SEBS (SEBSInsitu) at the three selected forest sites (SMC, QYZ, and SMF), respectively, while the mean coefficient of determination values for the estimated LE improved by (9.09 and 5.88)% compared to SEBSLandsat and SEBSInsitu, respectively, with reference to ground-based flux tower observations. Our analysis reveals that LiDAR-based parameterization of z(0m) can significantly increase the accuracy of estimated roughness lengths within an ET model, which can therefore improve the accuracy of the estimated turbulent heat fluxes. SEBSLiDAR was further evaluated for the spatially distributed mapping of actual ET. We have observed that ET estimated by SEBSLandsat overestimated in forest sites compared to EC observations; however, LiDAR-integrated SEBS marginally improved the accuracy of ET, thereby leading to an improvement in the mean correlation value of 0.87 and mean normalized standard deviation value of 0.93 approaching unity based on Taylor diagram, which more closely approximates the actual ground-based measurements. The proposed methodology overcomes the current limitation in the energy balance models in estimating roughness lengths, by providing accurate formulation of h(c) by specifically incorporating LiDAR mea-surements in areas of tall vegetation canopies. The operational improvement in roughness lengths by next-generation SEBSLiDAR model provides an opportunity to improve the estimation accuracy of water and energy fluxes, specifically ET.Overall, our proposed SEBSLiDAR model provides a benchmark that is useful to policy makers and water resource managers in devising a plan for sustainable use of water resources in the East Asian region, as well as other similar ecosystems.

TI  - Sustainable Development Goal Drivers in Food Systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interacting driving forces in food systems, resulting in cumulative driver effects and synergies, induce non-linear processes in multiple directions. This paper critically reviews the discourse on driving forces in food systems and argues that mindset is the primary predictor for food system outcomes. In the epoch of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Anthropocene, mindset matters more than ever. Transformative narratives are beginning to transcend the dominant social paradigm, which is still driving the food system's overall trajectory. The psychosocial portrayal of the systemic mindset found in organic food systems presented in this paper "flips the script" and hypothesizes that worldview and paradigm have the most causal linkages with unsustainable driver synergies and reversely the biggest leverage on the mitigation thereof. Borrowing from ecological economics discourses, the paper sharpens the driver definition by applying the DPSIR analytical tool as a modified diagnostic framework and modeling approach for food systems. This research sheds new light on the nature of drivers of change, which are often portrayed as almighty and inevitable trends shaping food systems. Instead, it is proposed that drivers emerge from the actors' mindset, affecting food system behavior in a non-linear way. Mindset drives reinforcing feedback loops, resulting in vicious and virtuous cycles. These driver motives manifest in subsystems and continue to drive their interaction across food system elements. Mindset acts as an encapsulated input of food systems, all the while responding to feedback and releasing new drivers. A transformation framework along leverage points of the food system is presented that features the concept of SDG drivers.

TI  - MSDM v1.0: A machine learning model for precipitation nowcasting over eastern China using multisource data
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern China is one of the most economically developed and densely populated areas in the world. Due to its special geographical location and climate, eastern China is affected by different weather systems, such as monsoons, shear lines, typhoons, and extratropical cyclones. In the near future, the rainfall rate becomes difficult to predict precisely due to these systems. Traditional physics-based methods such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) tend to perform poorly on nowcasting problems due to the spin-up issue. Moreover, various meteorological stations are distributed in this region, generating a large amount of observation data every day, which have great potential for application to data-driven methods. Thus, it is important to train a data-driven model from scratch that is suitable for the specific weather situation of eastern China. However, due to the high degrees of freedom and nonlinearity of machine learning algorithms, it is difficult to add physical constraints. Therefore, with the intention of using various kinds of data as a proxy for physical constraints, we collected three kinds of data (radar, satellite, and precipitation data) in the flood season from 2017 to 2018 in this area and preprocessed them into tensors (256 x 256) that cover eastern China with a domain of 12.8 x 12.8 degrees. The developed multisource data model (MSDM) combines the optical flow, random forest, and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. It treats the precipitation nowcasting task as an image-to-image problem, which takes radar and satellite data with an interval of 30 min as inputs and predicts radar echo intensity with a lead time of 30 min To reduce the smoothing caused by convolutions, we use the optical flow algorithm to predict satellite data in the following 120 min The predicted radar echoes from the MSDM together with satellite data from the optical flow algorithm are recursively implemented in the MSDM to achieve a 120 min lead time. The MSDM predictions are comparable to those of other baseline models with a high temporal resolution of 6 min To solve blurry image problems, we applied a modified structural similarity (SSIM) index as a loss function. Furthermore, we use the random forest algorithm with predicted radar and satellite data to estimate the rainfall rate, and the results outperform those of the traditional, nonlinear radar reflectivity factor and rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships that use logarithmic functions. The experiments confirm that machine learning with multisource data provides more reasonable predictions and reveals a better nonlinear relationship between radar echo and precipitation rate. Apart from developing complicated machine learning algorithms, exploiting the potential of multisource data will yield more improvements.

TI  - Detection of Oil Pollution Using SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Imagery: A Case Study of the Persian Gulf
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal regions in the Persian Gulf are renowned for having the largest oil reserves. Pipelines, as a means of oil transportation, are one of the most common options for transporting petroleum products in these regions. Hence, the risk of oil spill pollution has become a vital challenge for local authorities, which has gradually increased since the last decade. Therefore, it is essential to use a method for timely detection of oil spills to prevent environmental damage. In this study, Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 image have been used for timely detection of oil slicks in the Persian Gulf. The area of oil pollution that extracted from Sentinel-2 (optical data), Sentinel-1 (SAR data), and field data is 114.7, 98.5, and 124.7 square kilometres, respectively. The results indicated that the object-based image analysis (OBIA) method using optical data had better results than using SAR data. In addition, the results indicated that the OBIA could be used as a method to produce ground truth map. Therefore, this research demonstrates the applicability of remote sensing data to recognize oil spill pollution on the surface of the water with the applicability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - A controlled human infection model of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> pharyngitis (CHIVAS-M75): an observational, dose-finding study
T2  - LANCET MICROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Streptococcus pyogenes is a leading cause of infection-related morbidity and mortality. A reinvigorated vaccine development effort calls for new clinically relevant human S pyogenes experimental infection models to support proof of concept evaluation of candidate vaccines. We describe the initial Controlled Human Infection for Vaccination Against S pyogenes (CHIVAS-M75) study, in which we aimed to identify a dose of emm75 S pyogenes that causes acute pharyngitis in at least 60% of volunteers when applied to the pharynx by swab.Methods This observational, dose-finding study was done in a clinical trials facility in Melbourne (VIC, Australia). Groups of healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years, at low risk of complicated S pyogenes disease, and without high type-specific anti-emm75 IgG antibodies against the challenge strain were challenged and closely monitored as inpatients for up to 6 days, and then as outpatients for 6 months. Antibiotics were started upon diagnosis (clinical signs and symptoms of pharyngitis and a positive rapid molecular test) or after 5 days in those without pharyngitis. Rapid test results were confirmed by standard bacterial culture. After a sentinel participant, cohorts of five and then ten participants were challenged, with protocol-directed dose-escalation or de-escalation for subsequent cohorts. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants at each dose level with pharyngitis by day 5 after challenge. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03361163.Findings Between July 10, 2018, and Sept 23, 2019, 25 healthy adults were challenged with emm75 S pyogenes and included in analyses. Pharyngitis was diagnosed in 17 (85%; 95% CI 62-97) of 20 participants at the starting dose level (1-3 x 10(5) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL). This high proportion prompted dose de-escalation. At the lower dose level (1-3 x 10(4) CFU/mL), pharyngitis was diagnosed in one of five participants. Immunological, biochemical, and microbiological results supported the clinical picture, with acute symptomatic pharyngitis characterised by pharyngeal colonisation by S pyogenes accompanied by significantly elevated C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma and interleukin-6), and modest serological responses to streptolysin O and deoxyribonuclease B. There were no severe (grade 3) or serious adverse events related to challenge.Interpretation We have established a reliable pharyngitis human infection model with reassuring early safety findings to accelerate development of vaccines and other interventions to control disease due to S pyogenes.

TI  - Determination of burn severity models ranging from regional to national scales for the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying meaningful measures of ecological change over large areas is dependent on the quantification of robust relationships between ecological metrics and remote sensing products. Over the past several decades, ground observations of wildfire and prescribed fire severity have been acquired across hundreds of wildland fires in the United States, primarily utilizing the Composite Burn Index (CBI) plot protocol. These observations have been coupled to spaceborne passive spectral reflectance indices (e.g. Landsat-derived variations of the Normalized Burn Ratio [NBR]) to produce regression models describing their relationship. Here we develop regression models by vegetation type for multiple vegetation classification systems representing a range of spatial scales, and a decision tree framework for evaluating these regression models. Our overall goals were to determine which scale of ecological classifications provided the best estimate of burn severity from Landsat data and how to choose the best regression model. We aggregated a total of 6280 CBI plots for 234 wildland fires that burned between 1994 and 2017 and produced Landsat-derived NBR and differenced NBR (dNBR) values for each plot. We then calculated best fit linear or higher order regression equations between CBI and NBR/dNBR for each landcover classification system from smallest to largest scale: LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BPS), National Vegetation Classification macrogroup (NVC) landcover classifications, Omernick III, II, and I ecoregions, LANDFIRE Fire Regime Groups (FRG), and the entire conterminous United States (CONUS) dataset. The CONUS regression model goodness of fit was moderate (R2 = 0.55, P < 0.001) for dNBR and poor (R2 = 0.30, P < 0.001) for NBR. Within landcover classifications, CBI was better fit by dNBR than NBR. Finer scale regional regression models including BPS (dNBR R2 = 0.56 and 0.00-0.83 R2 range; NBR R2 = 0.43 and 0.00-0.82 R2 range) and NVC (dNBR R2 = 0.55 and 0.15-0.78 R2 range; NBR R2 = 0.41 and 0.00-0.79 R2 range) were on average the same or better than the CONUS models for dNBR and NBR, with the strongest fit models exhibiting R2 >= 0.70, whereas larger scale regional models R2 ranged from 0.28 to 0.5. However, variation in accuracy among landcover types indicate that dNBR and NBR regression models could be used to effectively estimate CBI for future fires in certain regions, while for other regions models may require additional field observations or alternative spectral transformations. Our decision tree schema can be used to help users determine which scale is likely to produce the most accurate results using our models. The CBI regression models developed here, paired with the decision tree, provide users with a simple method to estimate burn severity in units of CBI for any fire within CONUS with moderate to high levels of confidence and provide a template for further development of models with new data going forward.

TI  - Identifying Sources of Faecal Contamination in a Small Urban Stream Catchment: A Multiparametric Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small urban streams discharging in the proximity of bathing waters may significantly contribute to the deterioration of water quality, yet their impact may be overlooked. This study focuses on the Elm Park stream in the city of Dublin that is subject to faecal contamination by unidentified sources. The aim of the study was to identify a minimum number of "sentinel" sampling stations in an urban catchment that would provide the maximum amount of information regarding faecal pollution in the catchment. Thus, high-resolution sampling within the catchment was carried out over the course of 1 year at 11 stations. Faecal indicator bacteria were enumerated and microbial source tracking (MST) was employed to evaluate human pollution. In addition, ammonium, total oxidised nitrogen, and phosphorus levels were monitored to determine if these correlated with faecal indicator and the HF183 MST marker. In addition, the effect of severe weather events on water quality was assessed using automated sampling at one of the identified "sentinel" stations during baseflow and high flow conditions over a 24-h period. Our results show that this urban stream is at times highly contaminated by point source faecal pollution and that human faecal pollution is pervasive in the catchment. Correlations between ammonium concentrations and faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) as well as the human MST marker were observed during the study. Cluster analysis identified four "sentinel" stations that provide sufficient information on faecal pollution in the stream, thus reducing the geographical complexity of the catchment. Furthermore, ammonium levels strongly correlated with FIB and the human HF183 MST marker under high flow conditions at key "sentinel" stations. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of pairing MST, faecal indicators, and ammonium monitoring to identify "sentinel" stations that could be more rapidly assessed using real-time ammonium readouts to assess remediation efforts.

TI  - Modeling the effectiveness of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on forest health in Buxa Tiger Reserve, India, using fuzzy logic and AHP approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are the most valuable natural resource to protect organisms as well as ecosystem at a different level. With the rising change of land use and land cover pattern due to anthropogenic and natural disturbances, this resource is now subjected to experience constant exploitation and degradation. This paper explored the level of disturbances on forest health in Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR), a foothill ecosystem of Himalaya. Sentinel-2 data (2019) and fuzzy logic models were executed to understand the forest health status by using different vegetation indices. GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to know the beat-wise spatial disturbances of natural and anthropogenic factors in the study area. Then, disturbance maps were categorized into five zones from very high to very low. The result reveal that overall imprint of natural disturbance in BTR was a little bit high (very high = 13.76%, high = 31.58%, moderate = 15.91%, low = 27.03%, very low = 11.72%) in comparison to anthropogenic disturbance (very high = 11.09%, high = 19.07%, moderate = 24.47%, low = 20.01%, very low = 25.36%), but beat wise it varies significantly. Finally, the effectiveness of both disturbances on forest health was judged through correlation statistics. The forest beats (ID: 2, 4, 6, 7) which cover the core area of BTR have experienced less natural and anthropogenic disturbances with healthy and dense forest cover. On the other hand, less disturbance with poor forest health was found in hilly areas of buxa road and chunabhati beats (ID: 9, 15). Moreover, the effective natural and anthropogenic disturbances were mainly responsible to deteriorate the forest health adequately in most of the areas of BTR.

TI  - Extracting the spatio-temporal evolution and geographical features of shrinking Gongga Mountain glacier group during 1989-2017
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate-induced spatio-temporal evolutionary characteristics of glaciers have a strong response in understanding the surface earth system processes, including hydrology, ecology, and topography. With use of multispectral remote sensing, this study explores the longtime glacier shrinkage evolution and their geographical features of Gongga Mountain glaciers (i.e. Gongga Mountain glacier group), in eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. We used a band ratio and decision-tree classification mixed method to automatically delineate Gongga Mountain glaciers shrinking nature. Based on the multispectral Landsat images over nearly 30 years, the long-time spatiotemporal shrinkage evolution of Gongga Mountain glaciers was extracted, in which the glacier shrinkage area changes are consistent with the results from previous works. This study analyzed the nature of shrinking glaciers with topographic derivatives (i.e., different glacier scale, altitude, slope gradient, and slope direction). We noticed that the characteristic of shirking glaciers is associated with the topographic variables. The maximum shrinkage was concentrated at altitudes of 5000-5500 m, and a slope angle of 30 degrees in the south direction. Findings shed light that glaciers in our study area are correlated with temperature changes and precipitation with a correlation coefficient of-0.97 and 0.35, respectively, suggesting that the decreasing glaciers are highly correlated with the temperature increase. This study implies the usefulness of remote sensing in understanding the long-time ecological environment change and helping manage the potential glacial disasters in eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Analysis of erosion-accretion dynamics of major rivers of world's largest mangrove forest using geospatial techniques
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphological dynamics is the dominating process behind the Sundarbans mangrove forest development. Here, satellite images can illuminate Sundarbans' erosion-accretion dynamics to improve our understanding of better river management. Previous morphological studies were on mangrove vegetation loss or gain and shoreline changes detection. Nevertheless, those studies did not provide channel/river specific erosion and accretion dynamics for the Sundarbans in Bangladesh. In this study, we analyzed historical Landsat satellite images from 1980 to 2019 for six major rivers, namely Passur, Shibsa, Arpangasia, Baleshwar, Malancha, and Shella of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, which carry freshwater from upstream and supply them into all the tributaries of Sundarbans. Image analysis shows a remarkable erosion rate in all the major rivers. The erosion rates were significantly higher for Passur (2139 ha, 55 ha/yr), Baleshwar (2122 ha, 54 ha/yr), and Shibsa (1809, 46.5 ha/yr) rivers compared to the other three rivers (Arpangasia-995 ha, 26 ha/yr; Malancha-774 ha, 20 ha/yr; Shella332 ha, 8.5 ha/yr). The spatial pattern of lateral erosion was not uniform for all major rivers. The southern parts of all the rivers were prone to severe erosion compared to the central and northern parts. Reduced freshwater flow has less effect on the lateral erosion of major rivers of the Sundarbans. Besides, NDVI analysis shows that vegetation density has declined tremendously over the last 40 years (highest NDVI value in 1980 and 2019 was 0.87 and 0.44 respectively) along the major river banks as well as in whole Sundarbans which in turn reduces soil binding capacity. Hence, our work suggests that mangrove restoration with careful consideration of biophysical characteristics in the degraded site will aid better resistance against strong wave action.

TI  - Assessing the snow cover dynamics and its relationship with different hydro-climatic characteristics in Upper Ganges river basin and its sub-basins
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt is an important source of water in upstream part of the Ganges river basin (GRB), which provides water for different purposes to its 655 million inhabitants. However, studies assessing relationship between snow cover dynamics and changes in hydro-climatic variables are limited within this region, motivating the current research. In this study, MODIS snow cover product (MOD10A1) was used to assess the snow cover area (SCA) dynamics within the Upper Ganges river basin (UGRB) and its sub-basins for the time period of 2002-2014; available climate and hydrological data were used to assess the hydrological characteristics within three selected sub-basins in Nepal; and relationships between snow cover and different hydro-climatic variables are established for three sub-basins owing to availability of hydro-climatic data. Results show that the average annual maximum SCA is around 24.6-47.5% for UGRB and its sub-basins. Upper Yamuna river basin (UYRB) with lowest mean elevation among the sub-basins shows a single SCA peak in spring within an annual cycle, whereas UGRB and the higher sub-basins show an additional lower peak in fall mainly resulted from snow sublimation. During 2002-2014, SCA shows slight decreasing trends for UGRB (Kendall's Tau Tau = -0.039) and the higher elevation zones B (3001-4500 m a.s.l.) and C (>4500 m a.s.l.) of most sub-basins, with significance in Zone C of SaRB (Tau = -0.070) and KoRB (Tau = -0.062). Annual discharge for Gandaki river basin (GaRB) and Koshi river basin (KoRB) shows non-significant decreasing trends (Tau = -0.182, -0.303) which are resulted from decreasing discharge in different seasons in different sub-basins. Seasonal correlation analysis indicates an important water supply from rainfall in GaRB and combined water supply from rainfall and snowmelt in KoRB, along with dominant contribution of precipitation in monsoon months and snowmelt in non-monsoon months for all the three sub-basins.

TI  - Ranula as the First Symptom of HIV Infection in Young Patients
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Oral manifestations are often the earliest HIV signs. Salivary gland diseases are a common form of HIV expression. A ranula can occur in association with HIV. However, this manifestation is rarely considered as the disease sentinel sign. We present two cases of children consulting for a ranula, leading to the diagnosis of a previously unknown HIV infection. Case Reports. Two children, respectively, 5 and 13, were treated for a ranula by marsupialization. Relapse occurred in both cases, and thereafter, a ranula excision was performed. While the follow-up was uneventful, HIV infection was diagnosed during the patients' care. The only sign or symptom observed was the ranula. A routine HIV testing of ranula patients would have allowed earlier care. Conclusion. Routine HIV testing of patients with a ranula is justified and may be recommended, especially for children. Ranula excision associated with the sublingual gland resection is suggested in order to avoid recurrence.

TI  - How molecular imaging will enable robotic precision surgery The role of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and navigation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Molecular imaging is one of the pillars of precision surgery. Its applications range from early diagnostics to therapy planning, execution, and the accurate assessment of outcomes. In particular, molecular imaging solutions are in high demand in minimally invasive surgical strategies, such as the substantially increasing field of robotic surgery. This review aims at connecting the molecular imaging and nuclear medicine community to the rapidly expanding armory of surgical medical devices. Such devices entail technologies ranging from artificial intelligence and computer-aided visualization technologies (software) to innovative molecular imaging modalities and surgical navigation (hardware). We discuss technologies based on their role at different steps of the surgical workflow, i.e., from surgical decision and planning, over to target localization and excision guidance, all the way to (back table) surgical verification. This provides a glimpse of how innovations from the technology fields can realize an exciting future for the molecular imaging and surgery communities.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Endometrial Cancer: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is known as a common gynecological malignancy. The incidence rate is on the increase annually. Lymph node status plays a crucial role in evaluating the prognosis and selecting adjuvant therapy. Currently, the patients with high-risk (not comply with any of the following: (1) well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, pathological grade G1 or G2; (2) myometrial invasion< 1/2; (3) tumor diameter < 2 cm are commonly recommended for a systematic lymphadenectomy (LAD). However, conventional LAD shows high complication incidence and uncertain survival benefits. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) refers to the first lymph node that is passed by the lymphatic metastasis of the primary malignant tumor through the regional lymphatic drainage pathway and can indicate the involvement of lymph nodes across the drainage area. Mounting evidence has demonstrated a high detection rate (DR), sensitivity, and negative predictive value (NPV) in patients with early-stage lower risk EC using sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) with pathologic ultra-staging. Meanwhile, SLNM did not compromise the patient's progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with low operative complications. However, the application of SLNM in early-stage high-risk EC patients remains controversial. As revealed by the recent studies, SLNM may also be feasible, effective, and safe in high-risk patients. This review aims at making a systematic description of the progress made in the application of SLNM in the treatment of EC and the relevant controversies, including the application of SLNM in high-risk patients.

TI  - A geospatial assessment of growth pattern of aquaculture in the Indian Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) comprising over 100 estuarine islands and shared by human habitation and mangrove forests is considered to be a potential area for coastal aquaculture. This study, using LANDSAT imageries of the last two decades (1999-2019), delineated the spatiotemporal expansion of aquaculture at the expense of agricultural land, mudflats, and some mangroves. It also estimated a futuristic land transformation to aquaculture using the Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model. From the geospatial analysis, it is observed that (1) the aquacultures are mostly located around 22 degrees 30'N, i.e., far away from the saline seafront, (2) total aquaculture area has increased to nearly 5.82% of the entire SBR in 2019 from 3.59% in 1999 and, (3) cyclone Aila and its surge inundation have influenced in their expansion. This growth of aquaculture took place with the loss of 3.71% (10,536.67 ha) agricultural land, 3.87% (730.40 ha) mudflat, and 0.28% (623.23 ha) mangrove from 1999 to 2009, and 6.02% (13,471.50 ha) agricultural land, 9.98% (1583.64 ha) mudflat, and 0.18% (382.35 ha) mangrove during 2009-2019. According to the predictive modeling, similar to 6% of the present agriculture area is prognosticated to be converted to aquaculture by the next decade under a business-as-usual scenario.

TI  - Comparison of Snowmelt Runoff from the River Basins in the Eastern and Western Himalayan Region of India using SDSRM
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The runoff from the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) acts as a vital source of water, and therefore, estimation of runoff from snowmelt is very important. This study has been done with an objective to evaluate and compare snowmelt runoff for Mago basin in Arunachal Pradesh (Eastern Himalaya) and Alaknanda basin in Uttarakhand (Western Himalaya) using Spatially Distributed Snowmelt Runoff Model (SDSRM) with MODIS data. The performance of SDSRM was found to be satisfactory with model efficiency (ME) greater than 0.65 and R-2 greater than 0.7 in both the basins. The temperature was adjusted using temperature lapse rate, and snow parameters like snow density, snow depth, snow water equivalent, degree day factor and snowmelt depth were generated. Comparatively, the Eastern Himalayan basin was found to have higher mean values of these snow parameters than the Western Himalayan basin. The highest contribution of snowmelt runoff in the Eastern Himalayan basin was found to be 31.23% in the month of April and in the Western Himalayan basin, it was found as 44.70% in the month of May. It was also found from this study that snowmelt in both the Eastern and Western Himalayan basins starts from April and continues till September. The snowmelt contribution was comparatively higher in the Western Himalayan basin.

TI  - Estimation of soil microplastic input derived from plastic gauze using a simplified model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic gauzes have been widely used in the BTH region against haze events and for agricultural practices. The breakage of plastic gauzes would lead to the release of microplastics into soils, but it is difficult to estimate the inputs due to their wide implementation. In this study, we have conducted an estimation model based on the remote sensing technology for plastic gauze identification and the data from field experiments and literature. This model first managed to interpret the distribution of plastic gauzes from the Landsat8 images with the average overall accuracy at 0.92 and the average kappa at 0.77. By deeming the implementation duration of plastic gauzes from their distribution and using the breakage rates of plastic materials in soils reported in the literature, the model estimated that on average 1629.68 tons of microplastics have been released to soils from plastic gauze annually in the BTH region. Comparing with the microplastics released from other sources (e.g., personal care products, household dusts, laundry, and tire wear), plastic gauze could be a considerable contributor to soil microplastics.

TI  - Regional evaluation of satellite-based methods for identifying end of vegetation growing season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn phenology plays an important role in regulating ecosystem carbon and water cycling, but it has received less attention than spring phenology. Satellite-based methods have been widely applied in monitoring autumn phenology at large spatial scales. However, few studies have evaluated and compared the performance of different satellite-based methods in autumn phenology identification. Here, we compared the spatiotemporal variations of end of vegetation growing season dates (EOS) as determined from eight prevailing satellite-based methods against long-term field observations at 31 sites in China. We found that field-based observations in forest and grassland sites, respectively, had rates of EOS delay of 2.11 and 3.85 days per 1 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature (MAT) during 2001-2014. However, nearly all the eight satellite-based methods underestimated these delay rates compared with the ground observations over all sites. We also found that the eight methods weakly agreed with the field-observed interannual variations of EOS. At the regional scale, the identified average EOS differed up to 38 and 40 days among the investigated satellite-based methods in forest and grassland ecosystems respectively. The delayed rate of identified EOS with the increase of MAT ranged from 0.77 to 3.51 days degrees C-1 for forests and from 0.41 to 2.95 days degrees C-1 for grasslands. The identified EOS by most of the eight methods had delayed temporal trends in forests during 2001-2014 while we found advanced trends in grassland ecosystems. The large discrepancy in EOS identification among the prevailing satellite-based methods highlight the need for more accurate satellite-based methods in data gap-filling and phenometrics detection, and more extensive, multi-species based field observations that can be used to constrain and validate the satellite-based methods.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Damage Mapping With InSAR Coherence Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is playing an increasing role in the rapid mapping of damage after natural disasters. In particular, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can image the Earth's surface and map damage in all weather conditions, day and night. However, current SAR damage mapping methods struggle to separate damage from other changes in the Earth's surface. In this study, we propose a novel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time history of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous variations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. We quantify Earth surface change using time series of interferometric SAR coherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly detector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event coherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the coherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the forecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of confidence in the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage detection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local behavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to calculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multiyear time series of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Our approach shows good agreement with observed damage and quantitative improvement compared to using pre- to co-event coherence loss as a damage proxy.

TI  - Urban Impervious Surface Automatic Threshold Detection Model Derived From Multitemporal Landsat Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping urban impervious surfaces (UIS) from satellite images is crucial for understanding urban land cover change directions and addressing UIS change-induced environmental issues. The UIS index is an effective way to reduce the computational cost of processing remote sensing imageries although continuous UIS detection from multitemporal Landsat images, repeated fine-tuning, and reselection for a proper threshold should be considered. In this article, we proposed a novel UIS index and an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based UIS automatic threshold selection model (UISAT) to overcome those shortages when detecting UIS derived from multitemporal Landsat images. The proposed UIS index transformed different temporal Landsat images into index images with distinguishable pixel values for each gray pixel. In this way, the pixel gray values representing UIS were enhanced, and non-UIS was weakened with lower gray scales in the transformed index images. Next, an automatic threshold selection strategy was developed to enhance the applicability of the PSO model in terms of threshold fine-tuning and reselection. Then, we performed comprehensive assessments for the UISAT model, including in comparison to an improved convolutional deep belief network for relative accuracy verification, random points matching with Google Earth images, and comparing to other typical indices. The results demonstrated that the UISAT model provided the best performance in UIS detection from multitemporal Landsat images. The producer's accuracies (PAs) of UISAT results in Beijing, Hefei, and Guangzhou, China, were 91.73%, 93.87%, and 92.84%, while the user's accuracies (UA) were at 91.51%, 93.35%, and 92.24%. The proposed model outperformed the existing commonly used UIS indices [e.g., the Biophysical Composition Index (BCI), the Combinational Build-up Index (CBI), the Genetic Algorithm-based Urban Cluster Automatic Threshold (GA-UCAT), and the Gaussian-based Automatic Threshold Modified Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (G-MNDISI)] by an average increase of 6.51% in overall accuracy.

TI  - Bias-correcting carbon fluxes derived from land-surface satellite data for retrospective and near-real-time assimilation systems
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to monitor and understand natural and anthropogenic variability in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a growing need of many stakeholders across the world. Systems that assimilate satellite observations, given their short latency and dense spatial coverage, into high-resolution global models are valuable, if not essential, tools for addressing this need. A notable drawback of modern assimilation systems is the long latency of many vital input datasets; for example, inventories, in situ measurements, and reprocessed remote-sensing data can trail the current date by months to years. This paper describes techniques for biascorrecting surface fluxes derived from satellite observations of the Earth's surface to be consistent with constraints from inventories and in situ CO2 datasets. The techniques are applicable in both short-term forecasts and retrospective simulations, thus taking advantage of the coverage and short latency of satellite data while reproducing the major features of long-term inventory and in situ records. Our approach begins with a standard collection of diagnostic fluxes which incorporate a variety of remote-sensing driver data, viz. vegetation indices, fire radiative power, and nighttime lights. We then apply an empirical sink so that global budgets of the diagnostic fluxes match given atmospheric and oceanic growth rates for each year. This step removes coherent, systematic flux errors that produce biases in CO2 which mask the signals an assimilation system hopes to capture. Depending on the simulation mode, the empirical sink uses different choices of atmospheric growth rates: estimates based on observations in retrospective mode and projections based on seasonal forecasts of sea surface temperature in forecasting mode. The retrospective fluxes, when used in simulations with NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), reproduce marine boundary layer measurements with comparable skill to those using fluxes from a modern inversion system. The forecasted fluxes show promising accuracy in their application to the analysis of changes in the carbon cycle as they occur.

TI  - Sentinel-2 images deliver possibilities for accurate and consistent multi-temporal benthic habitat maps in optically shallow water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of frequently updated maps has always been the ultimate goal of remote sensing in benthic habitat data acquisition. Although the techniques offer cost and time effectiveness, the lack of consistency of inputted images can cause issues in successfully performing accurate multi-temporal mapping with minimum effort. This research aimed to assess the consistency of Sentinel-2 images for benthic habitat mapping in the waters of Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. We employed two approaches: 1) assessing the consistency of Sentinel-2 image used to map four classes of benthic habitat from 2017 to 2019 and 2) an in-depth analysis of three images in May 2019 to assess the consistency of four-class benthic habitat mapping (coral reef, seagrass, macroalgae and bare substratum). This research incorporated atmospheric, sunglint and water column corrections and four classification algorithms: Isodata, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Maximum Likelihood. The consistency of Sentinel-2 images was assessed using overall accuracy (OA), agreement percentage (AP) and total classification performance (TCP). Our results indicate that Sentinel-2 images are reliable enough for accurate benthic habitat mapping with OA >80% and consistent with agreement >80% in both approaches given the right image conditions, which are minimum cloud cover, haze, and sunglint. These factors strongly contribute to the consistency of the resulting benthic habitat classification from the Sentinel-2 images. Also, to maximize the rich image availability in the Sentinel-2 archive database, we suggest selecting images with minimal atmospheric and sunglint disturbances instead of performing image corrections that may introduce noise, leading to lower accuracy and consistency. Finally, we encourage the use of Sentinel-2 images in benthic habitat monitoring since the long-term plan of the Sentinel-2 mission guarantees the availability of these datasets.

TI  - Area, lake-level and volume variations of typical lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and their response to climate change, 1972-2019
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most lakes have undergone significant changes on the Tibetan Plateau in recent decades, affecting water resources on the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas. In this paper, we investigated the variations of 25 lakes in five sub-regions on the Tibetan Plateau from 1972 to 2019 based on SRTM DEM data and Landsat imagery. We used a method to derive lake-levels based on DEM and lake boundaries delineated from Landsat imagery, and then calculated the changes in lake area, level, and volume in 1972 to 2019. We also analyzed the potential impacts of temperature, precipitation, glacial and permafrost melting in lake changes during this period. The results show that the lakes tended to shrink until 2010 in southern and western plateau, after which they began to expand gradually but the overall trend is still shrinking. Limited meltwater from glaciers and permafrost and low precipitation are the main reasons for their shrinkage. The lakes in the central plateau, northwest plateau and northeast plateau tend to expand overall. The reason for the expansion of the lakes is not only precipitation but also the melting of glaciers and permafrost. Overall, the lake changes have gone through 3 phases, namely a slight decrease during 1972-2000, a rapid increase during 2000-2010, and a slowdown in the last decade (2010-2019). Multiple factors such as temperature, precipitation, the state of glaciers and permafrost have contributed to the changes in the lake.

TI  - Suitable Potential Land Evaluation for Surface Water Irrigation Using Remote Sensing and GIS-MCE in the Case of Rib-Gumara Watershed, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation plays a vital role to increase agricultural productivity and improve the livelihoods of the communities specifically and the economy of Ethiopia in general. However, there are gaps in development of irrigation schemes and irrigation practice. Therefore, land suitability evaluation is critical to identify the potential lands for surface irrigation. The aim of the study was to identify suitable lands for surface irrigation in Rib-Gumara watershed using remote sensing and GIS-based multicriteria evaluation techniques. The main criteria used in the study were land-use/land-cover (LULC), distance to rivers, slope, and soil physical and chemical properties like soil type, texture, drainage, depth, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity (ECe), pHs and exchangeable sodium percentage. The LULC types were extracted from Landsat 8 image using a maximum likelihood classifier. Surface analysis was used to extract slope factor from ASTER DEM, and watershed analysis was also employed to delineate watershed and extract rivers which are drained in the watershed. Likewise, Euclidean distance spatial analysis was also utilized to evaluate the distance of rivers to the potential land. Finally, each criterion was standardized and the analytical hierarchy process was applied to develop suitable irrigation land. The irrigation land suitability was ranked as highly suitable (S1), moderately suitable (S2), marginally suitable (S3) and not suitable (N1). Cross-tabulation was also done to understand the contribution of each factor to suitable irrigation land. The results of study show that 971.37 km(2) (27.55%) of the area of the watershed was highly suitable, whereas 2291.28 km(2) (64.99%) of the area was moderately suitable, 72.34 km(2) (2.05%) was marginally suitable and 190.46 km(2) (5.4%) was not suitable. Therefore, the government should intensively work and launch different irrigation scheme projects to utilize these potential irrigation lands of Rib-Gumara watershed.

TI  - Atonement impasse: The perennial problem of communicating Christ's atonement to Muslims
T2  - MISSIOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - For 1400 years, Muslims and Christians in interfaith dialogue have encountered a perennial impasse surrounding the historical account of Jesus' death. For most Muslims who hold a traditional interpretation of the Qur'an, Jesus did not die on the cross, but was assumed to heaven and another was crucified in his place. For Christians, however, the cross and subsequent resurrection are the center of gospel faith. This article recognizes the impasse over the crucifixion, but proposes that the conceptual distance surrounding the concept of atonement is a prior concern that needs to be addressed before one overcomes the historical question. In order to consider the barriers to communication and mutual understanding surrounding Jesus' cross, we must first recognize that the qur'anic understanding of atonement presents linguistic, ritual, narrative, and worldview barriers to a biblical understanding of atonement. As such, before one answers the question, "Did Jesus die on the cross?" it is imperative to ask, "Why would Jesus' death on the cross matter?" This article seeks to explain the distinct understanding of atonement represented in the Qur'an and to propose that the Book of Hebrews is uniquely suited to present a biblical understanding of atonement to one who is influenced by the Qur'an.

TI  - A review of constraints and solutions for collecting raptor samples and contextual data for a European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The COST Action 'European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility' (ERBFacility) aims to develop pan-European raptor biomonitoring in support of better chemicals management in Europe, using raptors as sentinel species. This presents a significant challenge involving a range of constraints that must be identified and addressed. The aims of this study were to: (1) carry out a comprehensive review of the constraints that may limit the gathering in the field of raptor samples and contextual data, and assess their relative importance across Europe; and (2) identify and discuss possible solutions to the key constraints that were identified. We applied a participatory approach to identify constraints and to discuss feasible solutions. Thirty-one constraints were identified, which were divided into four categories: legal, methodological, spatial coverage, and skills constraints. To assess the importance of the constraints and their possible solutions, we collected information through scientific workshops and by distributing a questionnaire to stakeholders in all the countries involved in ERBFacility. We obtained 74 answers to the questionnaire, from 24 of the 39 COST participating countries. The most important constraints identified were related to the collection of complex contextual data about sources of contamination, and the low number of existing raptor population national/regional monitoring schemes and ecological studies that could provide raptor samples. Legal constraints, such as permits to allow the collection of invasive samples, and skills constraints, such as the lack of expertise to practice necropsies, were also highlighted. Here, we present solutions for all the constraints identified, thus suggesting the feasibility of establishing a long-term European Raptor Sampling Programme as a key element of the planned European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility.

TI  - Discriminating the biophysical signal from human-induced effects on long-term primary production dynamics. The case of Patagonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal trend of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) is frequently used to estimate the effect of humans on ecosystems. In water-limited ecosystems, like most grazing areas in the world, the effect of humans act upon ANPP in combination with environmental variations. Our main objective was to quantify long-term (1981-2012) changes of ANPP and discriminate the causes of these changes between environmental and human at a subcontinental scale, across vast areas of Patagonia. We estimated ANPP through a radiative model based on remote sensing data. Then, we evaluated the relation between ANPP and environmental interannual variations of two hierarchically related factors: El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) through the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and precipitation. We described the effect of humans through the shape of the temporal trends of the residuals (RESTREND) of the environmental model and quantified human relative impact through the RESTREND: ANPP trend ratio. ANPP interannual variation was significantly explained by ENSO (through SOI) and precipitation in 65% of the study area. The SOI had a positive association with annual precipitation. The association between ANPP and annual precipitation was positive. RESTREND analysis was statistically significant in 92% of the area where the tested environmental model worked, representing 60% of the study area, and it was mostly negative. However, its magnitude, revealed through the RESTREND: ANPP trend ratio, was relatively mild. Our analysis revealed that most of ANPP trends were associated with climate and that even when human density is low, its incidence seems to be mainly negative.

TI  - Shedding Light on Agricultural Transitions, Dragon Fruit Cultivation, and Electrification in Southern Vietnam Using Mixed Methods
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural transition represents an essential component of land use and land cover change in countries across the world, as economic and social factors pressure agriculturalists out of traditional subsistence farming into commodity production. Modernization has altered modes of income, land ownership, and livelihood in Southeast Asia drastically in recent years. The Binh Thuan Province of southern Vietnam experienced a particularly radical transformation with the introduction of dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) cultivation, which has been profoundly encouraged by outside markets in China, Australia, Japan, and the United States. Dragon fruit plantation dynamics and recent expansion are captured via remotely sensed nighttime lights (NTL) data acquired by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible/Infrared Imager/ Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), revealing a seasonal signal important for differentiating various land uses on the ground. We employed the Breaks for Additive and Seasonal Trend (BFAST) algorithm to reduce and summarize seasonal trends in NTL data and then used the BFAST output combined with a Normalized Difference Lights Index (NDLI) value for each year in the period of 2012 through 2018 in a decision tree classifier to differentiate dragon fruit land use from city lights across the province. The final output was contextualized with a series of semistructured interviews to examine and characterize a changing agricultural landscape associated with dragon fruit cultivation. Dragon fruit plantation in southern Vietnam follows the land system transition pathways of many other agricultural contexts but presents unique physical and social outcomes for further investigation.

TI  - Satellite estimation of dissolved organic carbon in eutrophic Lake Taihu, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes serves as a substrate for heterotrophic bacterial growth, a regulator of the global carbon cycle, and a light absorption agent. DOC in eutrophic lakes is greatly influenced by phytoplankton phenology and terrigenous input by rivers. Therefore, it is necessary and significant to dynamically monitor the concentration, storage, and riverine exchange flux of DOC. By using in-situ DOC measurements from 2004 until 2018 (N = 2019), a machine learning algorithm, namely, a multilayer back-propagation neural network (MBPNN) model, was developed in this work to improve the remote sensing estimation of DOC concentrations in eutrophic Lake Taihu. The model yielded a mean estimation error of 15.14% for the testing dataset. The monthly mean DOC concentration significantly increased from 2003 to 2018 (N = 192, p < 0.01). High DOCs were observed in lake bays with high chlorophyll a (Chl-a) levels, and phytoplankton growth explained more than 50% of the monthly DOC variations. Then, given the evenly mixed DOC in the water column on the monthly and annual scales, we further estimated the monthly mean DOC storage in the lake from 2003 until 2018 and DOC fluxes (input and output) due to rivers during 2008-2018. Although the mean net riverine DOC input (50.56 +/- 32.22 x 10(3) t C) was approximately 5.2 times the average DOC storage (9.73 +/- 1.23 x 10(3) t C), phytoplankton growth controlled DOC variations, which indicated that much terrigenous DOC was transformed into other carbon forms after entering Lake Taihu. This study verified the feasibility of remote sensing of DOC (surface concentration, storage, and riverine exchange flux) in eutrophic lakes.

TI  - A simple and robust wetland classification approach by using optical indices, unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important for their peat reservoir, dynamic land cover and natural resources, ecological and hydrological regimes, fossil fuels reservoir, and crucial carbon storage. The global wetlands are decreasing since 1800 due to climatic phenomena and human activities. Wetland mapping with satellite data is not new but an ongoing challenge due to its precision relies on data quality and data classification schemes. The accuracy of such mapping is emerging due to the gradual establishment of satellite data and subsequent data modeling technologies, i.e., big data modeling with machine learning (ML) algorithms. Our study introduced a simple, scalable, and robust wetland classification by applying unsupervised (K-means cluster - KMC) and supervised (Support vector machine classification - SVMc) ML algorithms. We used Landsat optical data to model normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), as the primary inputs for KMC. Later KMC data were supervised by SVMc with training data from 20 field observations. The accuracy tests insights that both optical indices have considerably less error and all SVMc models have about 99% accuracy. The 1 to 1 validation insights that our wetland classification presented more detail wetland cover areas than reference data. The test case SVMc showed that Class 1 and 2 are optimally fitting, Class 3 and 4 are overfitting, and Class 5 is underfitting. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis insight that all SVMc models are optimally fitting and SVMc is more sensitive to NDVI than NDWI. From SVMc models we can see that Selisoo bog in Estonia lost a considerable amount of wetland covers including water bodies, and more large forest covers are taking wetland areas, i.e., mixed forest and coniferous trees. Our methodological approach insights a simple and robust wetland classification based on advanced unsupervised and supervised ML algorithms despite some unavoidable limitation.

TI  - Three decades of landscape change across the largest peri-urban horticultural region of Argentina: urban growth, productive intensification and the need for resilient landscape management
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and agricultural land expansion are the largest drivers of global land cover change. Here, we aimed to quantify three decades of land-use/land-cover change across one of the main horticultural regions of South America. We assessed landscape change implementing a supervised classification workflow on Landsat satellite imagery (1986, 1996, 2005 and 2015). Between 1986 and 2015, horticulture extent decreased (51.47%) at the expense of a high increase in greenhouses (2652.83%). Additionally, high density urbanization experienced a strong expansion (111.58%), while low density urbanization increased only between 1986 and 2005, replacing natural grassland, herbaceous parks and livestock. These results demonstrate a regional urban growth and productive intensification process that echoes similar global processes with consequential losses of open field horticultural areas and a non-equitable distribution of semi-natural areas in this region. Adequate territorial planning toward ecological resilient territories that consider ecological processes and prioritize semi-natural vegetation cover is urgently needed.

TI  - Modelling the spatial pattern of heatwaves in the city of Bern using a land use regression approach
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heatwaves have been the deadliest weather extreme events in Europe in the last decades. People living in cities are especially prone to such events due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect which increases the heat stress in urban surroundings especially during calm, steady, and radiation intensive synoptic situations. Since official measurement stations in cities are scarce, studies on spatial patterns of UHIs often rely on satellite data, hobby meteorologists' data, or on model outputs. Additionally, analyses of spatial UHI patterns using point-based measurements need adequate and cost-effective methods for spatial interpolation. In this study, air temperature data retrieved by 60 low cost measurement devices (LCD) are used to model the spatial pattern of the UHI with a land use regression (LUR) approach in Bern, Switzerland. For this purpose, 14 spatial variables with different buffer radii were calculated to evaluate their effect on the UHI and to interpolate the air temperature data. As a result, three models covering three different heatwaves at nighttime were developed. Given good model performance throughout the different scenarios, the here presented study demonstrates the successful interpolation of low cost temperature data by LUR modelling based on publicly accessible spatial information within a city.

TI  - Assessment of traffic congestion with high-resolution remote sensing data and deep convolution neural network
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, high resolution (HR) images, GIS and deep convolution neural network (DCNN) are used for assessment of traffic congestion. A DCNN architecture comprises one convolution layer, two pooling layers and a five-layer fully connected neural network (FCNN) evaluated for identifying vehicles in a movable window in HR images. A simple mathematical method is followed for changing the scale and orientation of the movable window to optimally mask and measure the area of vehicles. A formula is appraised to compute the traffic density using the estimated vehicles and road areas. A threshold is used to estimate traffic congestion from the measured traffic density. The method is validated by applying on World View-2 pan-sharpened multispectral images having spatial resolution 0.46 m. In comparison to CNN and ResNet-18, the proposed approach achieves a quite promising accuracy (99%) and needs less training and processing time for measuring traffic congestion in HR images.

TI  - InletTracker: An open-source Python toolkit for historic and near real-time monitoring of coastal inlets from Landsat and Sentinel-2
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their global abundance and high ecological and socio-economic significance, the dynamics of coastal inlets often remain poorly quantified at multi-decadal time scales. Here, we introduce InletTracker (https://github. com/VHeimhuber/InletTracker), a new tool that reconstructs the time-evolving state of dynamic coastal inlets over the last 30+ years from publicly available Landsat 5, 7 and 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. InletTracker is a Google Earth Engine enabled python toolkit that uses a novel least-cost pathfinding approach to trace inlets along and across the berm (i.e., barrier, bar), and then analyses the resulting transects to infer whether an inlet is open or closed. To evaluate the performance of InletTracker, we applied the tool at 12 intermittent coastal inlets with different maximum inlet widths (<= 30-200 m), geomorphological setting and opening frequency located across Southeastern and Southwestern Australia. This exercise involved 6363 unique binary inlet state predictions (i.e., open vs. closed) that were validated against visually inferred inlet states (from the satellite imagery itself), on-ground observational records, and in-situ water levels from inside the inlets. InletTracker reproduced the visually inferred inlet states with an average accuracy across all sites of 89% for the combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 record (15-30 m resolution) and 94% for the Sentinel-2 record only (10 m resolution). Overall, we found good agreement between the predictions of the tool and the three independent validation datasets for all but the smallest sites. Our results demonstrate that InletTracker will enable coastal engineers, managers, and researchers to gain new insights into the dynamics and drivers of coastal inlets or similar shallow water land forms such as river mouths, tidal flats, floodplains, wetlands or delta channel networks. Further, the high spatial (i.e., 10 m) and temporal (i.e., 5-daily) resolution provided by Sentinel-2 makes InletTracker a viable option for near real-time monitoring of even relatively small inlets with a minimum channel width of around 10 m and frequent, short-duration, openings.

TI  - Histopathological effects of short-term aqueous exposure to environmentally relevant concentration of lead (Pb) in shorthorn sculpin (<i>Myoxocephalus scorpius</i>) under laboratory conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) has been used as a sentinel species for environmental monitoring, including heavy metal contamination from mining activities. Former lead-zinc (Pb-Zn) mines in Greenland resulted in elevated concentrations of metals, especially Pb, in marine biota. However, the potential accumulation of Pb and effects of the presence of Pb residues in fish on health of sculpins observed in the field have not been validated in laboratory experiments. Therefore, our aim was to validate field observation of shorthorn sculpin via controlled laboratory exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved Pb. We evaluated the effects of a short-term (28 days) exposure to Pb on Pb residues in sculpin blood, gills, liver, and muscle and the morphology of gills and liver. The highest level of Pb was found in the gills, followed by muscle and then liver. Pb levels in liver, gills, and blood of Pb-exposed sculpins were significantly higher than those in control fish, showing that blood is suitable for assessing Pb accumulation and exposure in sculpins. Histopathological investigations showed that the severity score of liver necrosis and gill telangiectasia of Pb-exposed sculpins was significantly greater than in control fish. The number of mucous cells in gills was positively correlated with Pb concentrations in organs. Overall, the results validated field observation for the effects of Pb on wild sculpin and contributed to the improved use of the shorthorn sculpin as sentinel species for monitoring contamination from Pb mines in the Arctic.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite land surface albedo products over China using ground-measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo (LSA) is an important parameter in surface energy balance and global climate change. It has been used in the fields of energy budgets, climate dynamics, and land surface processes. To apply satellite LSA products more widely, the product accuracy needs to be evaluated at different scales and under atmospheric and surface conditions. This study validates and analyzes the errors of the LSA datasets from the Global LAnd Surface Satellites (GLASS) product, the European Space Agency's Earth Observation Envelope Programme (GlobAlbedo), the Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project, the Gap-filled Snow-free Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters product (MCD43GF), and the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) Albedo dataset from the AVHRR data (CLARA-SAL) against the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) measurements at different spatiotemporal scales over China from 2005 to 2015. The results show that LSA estimated by GLASS agrees well with the CERN measurements on a continental scale. The GLASS product is characterized by a correlation coefficient of 0.80, a root-mean-square error of 0.09, and a mean absolute error of 0.06. The consistency between GLASS, GlobAlbedo, and CLARA-SAL is slightly lower over the regions with high aerosol optical depth (AOD) (e.g. Sichuan Basin, northern China) and high cloud cover compared with that in regions with lower AOD and low cloud cover. The estimation errors are related to varying atmospheric and surface conditions and increase with increasing AOD and cloud cover and decreasing enhanced vegetation index. Therefore, algorithms under complex atmospheric and surface conditions (e.g. high AOD, sparse vegetation) should be optimized to improve the accuracy of LSA products.

TI  - Estimation and mapping of surface soil properties in the Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan using high-resolution remote sensing data
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil surveys and mapping with traditional methods are time-consuming and expensive especially in mountainous areas while demand for detailed soil information is steadily increasing. This study tested two spatial hybrid approaches to predict and map basic soil properties using high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and multispectral satellite imagery in a study area located in the Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan. Terrain attributes and spectral indices extracted from DEM with 12.5 m spatial resolution and Pleiades-1 data were used as auxiliary variables. A total of 115 soil samples were collected from the surface layer of 423 ha area and tested for soil organic carbon, soil reaction (pH in H2O and KCl solutions), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), sand, silt, clay and hygroscopic water content. The predictive capability of Universal Kriging (UK) and Random Forest Kriging (RFK) was evaluated using spatial cross-validation technique. To model and quantify the associated uncertainty of these models a probabilistic framework, kriging variance approach was applied. The uncertainty models were validated using independent and randomly selected control points (20% of the reference samples). For this, the actual fraction of true values falling within symmetric prediction intervals was calculated and visualized known as accuracy plot. Although the performances of the tested models were similar, RFK was superior in view of both accuracy and computed biases. The models were capable of delineating spatial pattern, mostly elevation dependent as well as the local patterns attributed by e.g., variations in vegetation, land use and soil erosion. UK model produced a few local erratic spatial patterns (e.g., in the case of pH) corresponding to the artifacts such as roads and houses in the image that should be considered in future applications. When comparing the uncertainties, both the models produced considerable underestimations and overestimations depending on soil property. RFK provided better uncertainty estimation for the most of soil properties than UK, the latter technique was more appropriate for the clay and pH(KCl) prediction. This case study confirmed the importance of assumptions made in uncertainty modelling and quantification. Those soil properties were therefore reliably predicted that their residuals were compatible with the normality assumption and showed apparent spatial correlation, e.g., both the models severely overestimated uncertainty of CaCO3 due to lack of normality assumption and low spatial correlation. This study showed that high resolution remote sensing data are promising, and the procedure presented in this study can be reliably used to map the studied soil properties and extended to partially larger adjacent areas characterized by similar environmental conditions in the Caucasus Mountains. However, with respect to future digital soil mapping, we assume that it is important to consider sampling design, testing other modelling approaches their uncertainties and multi-scale digital terrain analysis as well.

TI  - An opposition equilibrium optimizer for context-sensitive entropy dependency based multilevel thresholding of remote sensing images
T2  - SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earlier 1D histogram-based entropic methods for multilevel image thresholding suffer from the lack of contextual information. Subsequently, the idea was extended for 2D histogram-based methods, where neighbourhood pixels were considered to retain the contextual information. Nevertheless, 2D histogram-based entropic methods are computationally intensive. Moreover, these methods are based on the maximization of entropic functions using an optimizer, leading to less accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a context-sensitive entropy dependency (CSED) based multilevel thresholding method. A new optimizer called opposition equilibrium optimizer (OEO) is introduced. The opposition based learning and escaping strategy are incorporated to enhance exploration capability. Here, 31 test functions including 8 from standard testbed IEEE CEC 2014 are used for validation. The merits are - i) reduced complexity, ii) improved accuracy, iii) better stability and scalability, iv) enhanced exploration capability, v) well suited to random problems with changing dimensions, etc. The search history, trajectory, and average fitness history of the OEO are explicitly discussed. The Box plots and the convergence curves are presented to confirm its stability and faster convergence. Friedman's mean rank test, Bonferroni-Dunn test, and Holm's test are also carried out to ensure OEO superiority over others. Encouraging thresholding results on high dimensional colour satellite images from the Landsat image gallery are shown based on the suggested method (CSED-OEO). The quantitative measures (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Feature Similarity Index, and Structure Similarity Index) are used for validation. The CSED-OEO is compared with state-of-the-art methods and found better. It means, realistically, the method may be useful for segmentation-based analysis of colour images.

TI  - Development and assessment of a hospital admissions-based syndromic surveillance system for COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada: ACES Pandemic Tracker
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to pose a major global public health risk. The importance of public health surveillance systems to monitor the spread and impact of COVID-19 has been well demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to describe the development and effectiveness of a real-time public health syndromic surveillance system (ACES Pandemic Tracker) as an early warning system and to provide situational awareness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.MethodsWe used hospital admissions data from the Acute Care Enhanced Surveillance (ACES) system to collect data on pre-defined groupings of symptoms (syndromes of interest; SOI) that may be related to COVID-19 from 131 hospitals across Ontario. To evaluate which SOI for suspected COVID-19 admissions were best correlated with laboratory confirmed admissions, laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions data were collected from the Ontario Ministry of Health. Correlations and time-series lag analysis between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions were calculated. Data used for analyses covered the period between March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020.ResultsBetween March 1, 2020 and September 21, 2020, ACES Pandemic Tracker identified 22,075 suspected COVID-19 hospital admissions (150 per 100,000 population) in Ontario. After correlation analysis, we found laboratory-confirmed hospital admissions for COVID-19 were strongly and significantly correlated with suspected COVID-19 hospital admissions when SOI were included (Spearman's rho=0.617) and suspected COVID-19 admissions when SOI were excluded (Spearman's rho=0.867). Weak to moderate significant correlations were found among individual SOI. Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions lagged in reporting by 3 days compared with suspected COVID-19 admissions when SOI were excluded.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the utility of a hospital admissions syndromic surveillance system to monitor and identify potential surges in severe COVID-19 infection within the community in a timely manner and provide situational awareness to inform preventive and preparatory health interventions.

TI  - Environmental impact of COVID-19 led lockdown: A satellite data-based assessment of air quality in Indian megacities
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, including restricted human movement and economic activities, have shown positive impacts on the environment. Present research analysed the effects of COVID-19 led lockdown on air quality with special reference to major pollutants, namely nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The assessment has been conducted for megacities of India (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata) for four months, that is, March and April in 2019 and 2020 using Sentinel 5P and MCD19A2 data. A decrease in concentrations of air pollutants, specifically NO2 and SO2, has been observed during the lockdown period in all the cities; whereas CO and AOD have exhibited discrete pattern of spatio-temporal variation. Four megacities except Kolkata have revealed a positive correlation between NO2 concentration and population density. The results conclude overall improvement in air quality during COVID-19 led lockdown. The current situation provides a unique opportunity to implement a structural economic change that could help us move towards a city with low emission economy. Realizing the achievable improvement of air quality, the study suggests further in-depth research on source attribution of individual pollutants to assess the prospect of emission reduction actions.

TI  - Flooding and child health: Evidence from Pakistan
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the impact of flooding in Pakistan on child health using satellite data and two household datasets. Flooding may influence child health, as measured by weight-for-height z-score, through two key channels. First, excessive flood waters can catalyze the spread of diarrheal disease, negatively impacting child health. Second, excessive flood waters - even when damaging in some areas - provide water to rice paddies and other agriculture, increasing food availability in the post-flood period. This may positively influence child health. In Pakistan, we find evidence of both channels: floods increase incidence of morbidity (diarrhea and fever) as well as meal frequency in the post flood season. We also find that floods increase dietary diversity, but only in districts with high rice harvesting intensity where flooding may predict favorable growing conditions. Because these mechanisms (disease incidence and dietary adequacy) act against one another, we find weak overall impact of floods on child health. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mangrove carbon stocks in Pongara National Park, Gabon
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are recognized for their valued ecosystem services to coastal areas, and the functional linkages between those services and ecosystem carbon stocks have been established. However, spatially explicit inventories are necessary to facilitate management and protection of mangroves, as well as providing a foundation for payment for ecosystem service programs such as REDD+. We conducted an inventory of carbon stocks in mangroves within Pongara National Park (PNP), Gabon using a stratified random sampling design based on forest canopy height derived from TanDEM-X remote sensing data. Ecosystem carbon pools, including aboveground and belowground biomass and necromass, and soil carbon to a depth of 2 m were assessed using measurements and samples from plots distributed among three canopy height classes within the park. There were two mangrove species within the inventory area in PNP, Rhizophora racemosa and R. harrisonii. R. harrisonii was predominant in the sparse, low-stature stands that dominated the west side of the park. In the east side of the park, both species occurred in tall-stature stands, with tree height often exceeding 30 m. Canopy height was an effective means to stratify the inventory area, as biomass was significantly different among the height classes. Despite those differences in aboveground biomass, the soil carbon density was not significantly different among height classes. Soils were the main component of the ecosystem carbon stock, accounting for over 84% of the total. The ecosystem carbon density ranged from 644 to 943 Mg C ha(-1 )among the three height classes. The ecosystem carbon stock within PNP is estimated to be 40,588 Gg C. The combination of pre-inventory information about stand conditions and their spatial distribution within the assessment area obtained from remote sensing data and a spatial decision support system were fundamental to implementing this relatively large-scale field inventory. This work exemplifies how mangrove carbon stocks can be quantified to augment national C reporting statistics, provide a baseline for projects involving monitoring, reporting and verification (i.e., MRV), and provide data on the forest composition and structure for sustainable management and conservation practices.

TI  - Modeling the electricity consumption by combining land use types and landscape patterns with nighttime light imagery
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring electricity consumption (EC) under high spatiotemporal resolution is important for optimizing energy utilization. Although current studies have established various regression models to spatialize EC using Nighttime light (NTL) imagery under the accepted assumption that EC is directly related with NTL, the impact of other factors on the EC-NTL relationship is not fully considered. In this study, we introduced land use types and landscape patterns to optimize EC-NTL model. Specifically, we constructed 12 indicators using NTL and Landsat TM/ETM + imageries to model EC, which considers both human activity and landscape patterns on different land use types. A multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was applied to build the heterogeneous relationship. Experiments were conducted on 292 prefecture-level cities in China. Results showed that the MGWR model gets an adjusted R-2 as 0.92, which is 13.6% and 8.2% higher than the simple and multiple linear regression. Five indicators obviously correlated with EC were pinpointed, including the total area of urban and industrialmining land, NTL mean, NTL standard deviation and patch density of rural settlement. It is argued that scale is an effective proxy at urban and industrial-mining land, while NTL distribution is representative at rural settlement for modelling EC. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of the urban heat island footprint in the context of urbanization, a case study in Beijing, China
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving our understanding of the spatial pattern of the urban heat island (UHI) effect is an important aspect of current studies on the urban thermal environment. In this study, we applied a UHI footprint (UHI FP) analysis for the metropolitan region of Beijing using a two-dimensional Gaussian model, based on the Landsat series and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime datasets. The temporal trend of the summer UHI FP metrics and their possible associations with urbanization factors (i.e., GDP, population, and built-up area in statistical yearbook) were explored. We found that the study area experienced an extensive UHI effect in the daytime during summer, with more than 2 degrees C UHI intensity and a footprint of over 1900 km(2). During the period 2000-2019, the spatial extent of the UHI FP exhibited a significant increasing trend, including nearly 20% increase in the UHI FP region with higher thermal risk and nearly 30% in the ordinary UHI FP region. Moreover, the UHI FP showed a significant association with urbanization factors, indicating that economic, population, and urban land uses are responsible for the expansion of the UHI effect. This study highlights the importance of footprint analysis to depict the dynamic characteristics of the thermal environment of cities. Further UHI FP study is required to provide comprehensive references for sustainable urban planning and development.

TI  - Label-free quantification proteomics reveals the active peptides from protein degradation during anaerobic fermentation of tea
T2  - LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although active peptide is an important functional component, the mechanism of releasing peptides promoted by the degradation of tea protein during fermentation is still unclear. The profiles of peptides and tea proteins in pickled tea during anaerobic fermentation were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that water-soluble proteins are the main target of hydrolysis in the fermentation, and the degradation of tea protein clusters at different fermentation time triggers the continuous release of peptides. ILW, WLR, WY, YV, ELW, FY, and PYV are considered to be the key peptides related to the antioxidant activity of pickled tea, and enzyme proteins especially rubisco and tubulin family proteins may be responsible for the release of these potential antioxidant peptides. Peptides derived from tea proteins are suggested to be one of the key antioxidants in pickled tea. The findings can promote to targeted degradation of tea protein to increase the active peptides and function in microbial fermented tea.

TI  - Assessment of flash flood hazard based on morphometric aspects and rainfall-runoff modeling in Wadi Nisah, central Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of monitoring and observational data is hampering the assessment of flash flood hazard in arid environments. This study forecasts and investigates flash floods hazards in Wadi Nisah basin in the central region of Saudi Arabia. An integrated approach of Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and Watershed Modeling System (WMS) is presented to determine the flash flood hazards based on morphometric analysis along with rainfall runoff modeling. RS datasets including Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data for digital elevation model (DEM), and SPOT-5 satellite images for land cover mapping, in addition to meteorological data (represented in historical rainfall logs) are used. The study area is divided into 14 sub-basins according to the 5th stream order. The morphometric parameter's analysis clearly show that 42.3%-62% of the total region of Wadi Nisah is highly prone to flooding. Furthermore, medium- and low-hazard areas make up 2.1%-36.4% and 16.5%-55.6% of the total area, respectively. Rainfall-runoff modeling shows that the peak discharge values of sub-basin 14, covers 39.6% of the Wadi Nisah total area, making it greater than that of other sub-basins for each return period, ranging from 12.3 m(3)/s for a 5-year return period to 294.5 m(3)/s for a 100-year return period. Accordingly, sub-basin 14 poses more flood risk than other Wadi Nisah sub-basins, as confirmed by the morphometric ranking method analysis.

TI  - Mapping essential urban land use categories with open big data: Results for five metropolitan areas in the United States of America
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of various land use types are critically important for urban planning, environmental management, disaster control, health protection, and biodiversity conservation. Recent advances in remote sensing and social sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses, limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using openly available multi-source geo-spatial "big data". With street blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height, socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II) classification could be high as 91% and 86%, respectively. A multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models achieved better performance than base models such as random forest, extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88% and 81%, respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in block-level land use classifications, which have important implications for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis and potential impact factors of vegetation variation in the karst region of Southwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The karst region of Southwest China is one of the largest in the world. Due to the effects of human activities and climate change, rocky desertification has become the primary ecological disaster which has significantly hindered the economic growth in Southwest China. In recent decades, the Chinese government has carried out a number of ecological restoration projects in Southwest China. This study aims to analyze the changes in vegetation coverage and its main driving factors in the Southwest China and the karst region of Southwest China from 2001 to 2015 through trend analysis, Hurst index correlation analysis, correlation analysis, and residual analysis. The results showed that (1) both Southwest China and the karst region of Southwest China experienced significant increasing trends in annual fractional vegetation cover, at a rate of 0.0028 year(-1) and 0.0029 year(-1), respectively; (2) the NDVI of the Southwest China and the karst region of Southwest China was stable, and the vegetation coverage areas showed low to medium fluctuations, accounting for 97.17% and 98.32% respectively; (3) the NDVI of the Southwest China and the karst region of Southwest China had strong sustainability, and the sustainable and improved regions account for 74.79% and 75.77% respectively; and (4) climate change had little influence on vegetation restoration, and human activities had a great influence on vegetation restoration. The relative contribution rates of human activities and climate change to vegetation NDVI changes in the Southwest China were 86% and 14%, respectively, and 90% and 10% in karst regions of Southwest China. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of vegetation change in karst region and may provide scientific support for local vegetation restoration and conservation policies.

T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The endeavors to develop manufacturing methods that can enhance polymer and composite structures in spacecraft have led to much research and innovation over many decades. However, the thermal stability, intrinsic material stress, and anisotropic substrate properties pose significant challenges and inhibit the use of previously proposed solutions under extreme space environment. Here, we overcome these issues by developing a custom-designed, plasma-enhanced crosslinked poly(p-xylylene):diamond-like carbon superlattice material that enables enhanced mechanical coupling with the soft polymeric and composite materials, which in turn can be applied to large 3D engineering structures. The superlattice structure developed forms an integral part with the substrate and results in a space qualifiable carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer featuring 10-20 times greater resistance to cracking without affecting the stiffness of dimensionally stable structures. This innovation paves the way for the next generation of advanced ultra-stable composites for upcoming optical and radar instrument space programs and advanced engineering applications.

TI  - Dynamics of active fire data and their relationship with fires in the areas of regularized indigenous lands in the Southern Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in active fire data in the Amazon puts the entire international community on alert, as they may result in fires and deforestation. Thus, this study aims to present the dynamics of active fire data and their relationship with the fires in 16 Regularized Indigenous Lands (RILs) located entirely in the state of Rondonia, in the southern amazon. The entire historical series of active fire data (from 1998 to 2020) were obtained to achieve the objectives, and nine Landsat-OLI scenes from September 2020 were processed. The active fire data dynamics revealed that the correlation coefficient between the total number of active fire data in the immediate surroundings (10 km) and the number of active fire data within the analyzed indigenous land areas was higher than 0.7. This means that the variation in the number of fire outbreaks within indigenous lands can be explained by the number of outbreaks occurring outside them. Image processing revealed 11 classes of land use and land cover with an overall accuracy of 92%. Based on the mapping of land use and cover for the nine Landsat scenes, it is possible to verify that the burnt area totaled 3,943.50 km(2). Besides, 953.90 km(2) (24.19%) were located entirely within the indigenous lands, mainly on the Massaco and Urn Eu Wau Wau indigenous lands. By analyzing the density of active fire data, it is possible to verify that most of the outbreaks are located at the edges of the RILs. This shows that these areas work as a barrier to the spread of fire in the South of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, despite the identification of regions burnt within indigenous lands, the study concluded that RILs are essential for protecting the Amazon's native vegetation.

TI  - Spectral decomposition of remote sensing reflectance variance due to the spatial variability from ocean color and high-resolution satellite sensors
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of the remote sensing reflectance, R-rs, now routinely retrieved from ocean color (OC) and high spatial resolution sensors, is often used to characterize water variability due to changes in inherent optical properties of the water body. At the same time, R-rs is partially variable because of uncertainties in its retrieval in the process of atmospheric correction. Using data from SNPP-VIIRS and Landsat-8 OLI sensors, the contribution of the main components to the variance of R-rs due to its spatial variability is determined based on a model in which variances were considered proportional to the mean values of the corresponding components. It is shown that there is practically no spatial variability in the open ocean waters and water variability is proportional to the spatial resolution of the sensor in coastal waters. Variances due to surface effects, inaccuracies of aerosol models, and sunglint can contribute significantly to R-rs variance, which characterizes R-rs spatial variability, with variances due to the water variability itself often being significantly smaller.

TI  - Recurrent-based regression of Sentinel time series for continuous vegetation monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time series of optical satellite imagery describing vegetation activity provide essential information for the efficient and regular monitoring of vegetation. Nevertheless, the temporal resolution of optical sensors is strongly affected by cloud cover, resulting in significant missing information. The use of complementary acquisitions, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, opens the door to the development of new multi-sensor methodologies aiming at the reconstruction of missing information. However, the joint exploitation of new radar and optical missions, such as the Sentinel, raises new challenges given the different nature and response of the two data sources. In this work, the SenRVM methodology is proposed as a new multi-sensor approach to regress SAR time series towards Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A deep Recurrent Neural Network architecture which integrates SAR acquisitions and ancillary data is adopted. The regression task permits a continuous optical temporal resolution of 6 days. Multiple experiments are carried out to assess the SenRVM framework by studying two large-scale areas in France. Through an extensive interpretation of the results, SenRVM is evaluated on three main vegetation types (grasslands, crops, and forests). High accurate results (R2 0.83 and MAE < 0.05) over more than 140,000 vegetation polygons are obtained, both for multi-class and class-specific models. The importance of the SenRVM input features is discussed through an ablation study, highlighting that the relevance of the features differs for the various classes. The good performances of SenRVM are assessed by evaluating the quality of the reconstruction over short- and long-term data gaps. Results are compared to five state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, some preliminary experiments are first carried out to show how SenRVM results could be used to improve the existing cloud & shadow masks. The recovering of time series breaks caused by vegetation cover changes is also illustrated.

Although far from trivial, this would imply that these impacts only affect ecosystems that arc already heavily modified by humans and are relatively limited in their spatial extent, at least as compared with some key anthropogenic pressures on the environment that attract much more scientific and public attention, such as dimate change or plastic pollution. However, there are a number of reasons to believe that ALAN and its impacts are more pervasive, and therefore need to be viewed from a broader geographic perspective rather than an essentially urban one. Here we address, in turn, 11 key issues when considering the degree of spatial pervasiveness of the biological impacts of ALAN. First, the global extent of ALAN is likely itself commonly underestimated, as a consequence of limitations of available remote sensing data sources and how these are processed. Second and third, more isolated (rural) and mobile (e.g., vehicle headlight) sources of ALAN may have both very widespread and important biological influences. Fourth and fifth, the occurrence and impacts of ALAN in marine systems and other remote settings, need much greater consideration. Sixth, seventh, and eighth, there is growing evidence for important biological impacts of ALAN at low light levels, from skyglow, and over long distances (because of the altitudes from which it may be viewed by some organisms), all of which would increase the areas over which impacts are occurring. Ninth and tenth, ALAN may exert indirect biological effects that may further expand these areas, because it has a landscape ecology (modifying movement and dispersal and so hence with effects beyond the direct extent of ALAN), and because ALAN interacts with other anthropogenic pressures on the environment. Finally, ALAN is not stable, but increasing rapidly in global extent, and shifting toward wavelengths of light that often have greater biological impacts.

TI  - A novel remote sensing method to determine reservoir characteristic curves using high-resolution data
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method of determining reservoir characteristic curves based on high-resolution resource satellite data was proposed in this paper, using remote sensing processing and analysis technology. According to the physical characteristics of absorption, radiation and reflection of surface water on ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared bands, etc., the satellite images at different reservoir water level and different periods were processed to analyze the relationship of measured water level corresponding to the water area. Based on the relationship, the relevance among reservoir water level, water surface area, and reservoir capacity was established, so as to determine the reservoir characteristic curve. The method was applied and validated at Jinshuitan Reservoir and Shitang Reservoir in the Ou River Basin. The results show that this method has high accuracy, and the maximum relative error between calculating values and measured values at different water level are -2.33% and -2.11% in Jinshuitan Reservoir and Shitang Reservoir, respectively. The method improves the convenience of determining the reservoir characteristic curve greatly, and the storage capacity of the reservoir can be calculated rapidly by this method.

TI  - Disrupting the Empire and Forging IR: The Role of India's Early Think Tanks in the Decolonisation Process, 1936-1950s
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HISTORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike their Western counterparts, the roles and history of non-Western think tanks have been little studied. The first Indian think tank, the Indian Institute of International Affairs (IIIA), has been mostly considered peripheral to the history of International Relations and the end of the British Empire. Yet, this organisation was neither just an addition to Dominion institutes studying international affairs, nor simply a colonial institution against which the nationalist Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) emerged. Moulded in the image of the metropole think tank, Chatham House, and its sister organisations, the IIIA was set up with the same objective of strengthening the empire through new institutional bonds and a common global outlook. Instead, it contributed to disrupting the imperial logic underlying this project through India's internationalisation and the diverging worldview it publicised within the Commonwealth. The ICWA can be understood within this trajectory of emancipation from the global project of Empire, and within a larger struggle to define the world order. Revisiting early Indian think tanks helps us better understand the relation between IR, political power, and decolonisation, and retrieve a non-Western international engagement, one parallel but distinct from the well-known anticolonial internationalism of the interwar years.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts of burning biomass on regional transport under various emission conditions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted by burning biomass has become the main source of pollution in cities; this pollution seriously threatens the ecosystem and inhabitants' health. A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of burning biomass on PM2.5 regional transport. In this study, Harbin-Changchun Megalopolis is the research area. Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model combined with satellite data and PM2.5 monitoring data, we quantitatively analyzed the regional transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass upwind of each city under different emission conditions. Conditions at burn sites, especially emission intensity and meteorological factors, as well as transport distance play significant roles in the regional transport of PM2.5. Higher emission intensity aggravated the concentration of downwind PM2.5, at most 19.7 mu g.m(-3). Shorter transport distance strengthened the impact of biomass burning on downstream PM2.5 by weakening elimination, which could be up to 96.8 mu g.m(-3). Moreover, meteorological factors at fire points were closely related to the transport of PM2.5. First, lower planetary boundary layer height could enhance the transport of PM2.5 from the burning biomass by inhibiting vertical diffusion, and the enhancement could be up to 46.1 mu g.m(-3). Second, compared to strong wind, light wind caused the weaker dilution, enhancing PM2.5 regional transport by as much as 32.5 mu g.m(-3). Third, relatively humidity at 30%-40% had the strongest effect in facilitating the transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass. We conclude that comprehensively considering these three factors, namely the emission intensity, transport distance and meteorological factors at burn sites can facilitate the cross-regional development of accurate prediction models and effective pollution control measures.

TI  - St Helena Marine Water Quality: Background Conditions and Development of Assessment Levels for Coastal Pollutants
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - St Helena is an isolated oceanic island located in the tropical South Atlantic, and knowledge of broadscale oceanography and productivity in its surrounding waters is limited. This study used model outputs (2007-2017), remote sensing data (1998-2017) and survey measurements (April 2018 and 2019) to determine background conditions for nutrients, chlorophyll and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in offshore waters and propose standards (thresholds) for assessing inshore water quality based on 50% deviation from seasonal (usually June to November) or annual averages. Seasonal thresholds were proposed for surface nitrate (average 0.18 mu M), phosphate (average 0.26 mu M), silicate (average 2.60 mu M), chlorophyll (average 0.45 mu g chl l(-1)), and SPM (average 0.96 mg l(-1)). Associated background values for most surface parameters (phosphate 0.17 mu M, silicate 1.57 mu M, chlorophyll 0.30 mu g chl l(-1); from model outputs and remote sensing) were slightly higher than offshore observations (April 2019). For nitrate, the average background value (0.12 mu M) was lower than the observed average (0.24 mu M). At depth (150-500 m), annual background values from model outputs were high (nitrate 26.8 mu M, phosphate 1.8 mu M, silicate 17.3 mu M). Observed water masses at depths >150 m, identified to be of Antarctic and Atlantic origin, were nutrient-rich (e.g., 16 mu M for nitrate, April 2019) and oxygen deficient (<4-6 mg l(-1)). A thermocline layer (between ca. 10 and 230 m), characterized by a sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (average 0.3-0.5 mu g chl l(-1)) near the bottom of the euphotic zone (ca. 100 m), is likely to sustain primary and secondary production at St Helena. For assessing inshore levels of chemical contaminants and fecal bacteria estimated from survey measurements, standards were derived from the literature. A preliminary assessment of inshore observations using proposed thresholds from surface offshore waters and relevant literature standards indicated concerns regarding levels of nutrients and fecal bacteria at some locations. More detailed modeling and/or field-based studies are required to investigate seasonal trends and nutrient availability to inshore primary producers and to establish accurate levels of any contaminants of interest or risk to the marine environment.

TI  - Detection of Hydrothermal Alteration Zones using Landsat 8 OLI image: A Case Study of Gold Prospecting in Nyongwon Area, DPR Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focused on the detection of alteration zones associated with the hydrothermal gold deposit using Landsat 8 OLI image data. In this paper, the hydrothermal alteration zones in the study area were detected from visible-near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of Landsat 8 OLI image data. One of the important issues for detecting hydrothermal alteration zones is to reduce the effects of the vegetation spectrum that affects the spectral feature extraction of the hydrothermally altered minerals in the relatively dense cover area. In this paper, we extracted the feature of the vegetation spectrum in the area using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) technique, then subtracted the corresponding vegetation abundance from the image pixel spectrum, finally we obtained the image with reduced vegetation effects. In the study area, the mapped hydrothermal alteration zones are mainly regions with high content of iron oxide and clay minerals and these are regions closely associated with hydrothermal mineralization. Crosta technique was used for mapping these altered zones. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out by selecting Landsat 8 OLI bands 2, 4, 5, 6 for mapping iron oxides and Landsat 8 OLI bands 2, 5, 6, 7 for mapping clay minerals. These alteration zones including the iron oxides and clay minerals in the study area were clearly represented in the generated images. These alteration zones are valuable for prospecting the gold deposit based on the ore geological characteristics of this area.

TI  - Regional mass variations and its sensitivity to climate drivers over glaciers of Karakoram and Himalayas
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional scale mass change provides a substantial understanding to the influence of climate change on the glacier surface. However, the scarce ground observations and large spatial extent limit the use of field-based mass balance estimation. In this study, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data were used to estimate the regional glacier mass variation over the Karakoram and Himalayas (KH) region during 2002-2019 hydrological years. Our study showed that the total mass change rate over the KH region was - 55.0 +/- 8.7 Gt yr(-1) for the study period. We have identified four positive/negative clusters of mass change over the KH region, with the eastern part of the Karakoram (KK) and part of the Central Himalaya (CH) regions have experienced a positive mass change. In contrast, the junctio n area between the Western Himalaya (WH) and CH region observed an extreme negative mass change. The results demonstrated that the annual mass change for WH become negative or nearly zero from 2007/08 onwards, while for CH and Eastern Himalaya (EH) regions, it became negative since 2005/06. The GRACE-derived mass change was validated with the published in-situ mass balance data, which reveals a high correlation (r = 0.77) over the region. The performance of obtained results were also compared with Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-1 (ICESat-1) data for the period 2003-2009, indicating a correlation of 0.87 and 0.91 for monthly and annual scale, respectively. Moreover, the interannual mass change in the glaciated region was analyzed using hydro-climatic data and energy fluxes, suggesting a higher correlation of mass change with total precipitation and snowfall over the spatiotemporal scale. However, this correlation fails at locations where evaporation, runoff, and radiation have prominently influenced the mass loss. The uncertainty and sensitivity test for mass change demonstrated that snowfall and temperature have a strong influence on the response of mass change. Overall, this study provided regional mass change and their relationship with hydro-climatic variables, which will provide a better understanding related to the water availability in the downstream areas.

TI  - Predictive soil mapping using historic bare soil composite imagery and legacy soil survey data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing need for detailed soil property maps to support land use planning, soil carbon accounting, and precision agriculture. While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958-1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75-25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R-2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R-2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R-2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g(-1), with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time.

TI  - ESTABLISHMENT OF A DIAGNOSTIC METHOD FOR PELVIC SENTINEL LYMPH NODE METASTASIS BY CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND IN UTERINE CANCER
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the usefulness of conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in distinguishing metastasis of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with gynecological cancer. We examined 74 SLNs of patients with endometrial cancer (n = 26) and cervical cancer (n = 11). Patients underwent US and CEUS followed by SLN biopsy; US and CEUS results were evaluated visually and quantitatively and compared between pathological metastasis-negative and -positive groups. To support CEUS results, the microvessel density of SLNs was evaluated immunohistochemically. Seventeen positive and 40 negative SLNs were evaluable. Margin and enhancement patterns by visual assessment revealed significant differences (p = 0.046 and 0.022, respectively). In quantitative time-intensity curve analyses, the weakest peak intensities (PImin), PI ratio and PI difference indicated significant differences (p = 0.045, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were 0.64, 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. The most effective PI ratio from the AUC was 1.3 (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 70%), and the PI difference from the AUC was 20 (sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 70%). Microvessel density was significantly lower in metastatic lesions than in other areas. The quantitative analysis of CEUS seemed to be a reasonable method for distinguishing lymph node metastasis in patients with gynecological cancer.

TI  - Circulating exosomal <i>miR-363-5p</i> inhibits lymph node metastasis by downregulating <i>PDGFB</i> and serves as a potential noninvasive biomarker for breast cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (LN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical LN-negative breast cancer (BC) patients but it is prone to false-negative results and complications. Thus, an accurate noninvasive approach for LN staging is urgently needed in clinical practice. Here, circulating exosomal microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in peripheral blood from BC patients and age-matched healthy women were obtained and analyzed. We identified an exosomal miRNA, miR-363-5p, that was significantly downregulated in exosomes from plasma of BC patients with LN metastasis which exhibited a consistent decreasing trend in tissue samples from multiple independent datasets. Plasma exosomal miR-363-5p achieved high diagnostic performance in distinguishing LN-positive patients from LN-negative patients. The high miR-363-5p expression level was significantly correlated with improved overall survival. Functional assays demonstrated that exosomal miR-363-5p modulates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling activity by targeting PDGFB to inhibit cell proliferation and migration. Our study revealed, for the first time, plasma exosomal miR-363-5p plays a tumor suppressor role in BC and has the potential for noninvasive LN staging and prognosis prediction of BC.

TI  - Regional suitability prediction of soil salinization based on remote-sensing derivatives and optimal spectral index
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is an extremely serious land degradation problem in arid and semi-arid regions that hinders the sustainable development of agriculture and food security. Information and research on soil salinity using remote sensing (RS) technology provide a quick and accurate assessment and solutions to address this problem. This study aims to compare the capabilities of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI in RS prediction and exploration of the potential application of derivatives to RS prediction of salinized soils. It explores the ability of derivatives to be used in the Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI multispectral data, and it was used as a data source as well as to address the adaptability of salinity prediction on a regional scale. The two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) optimal spectral indices are used to screen the bands that are most sensitive to soil salinity (0-10 cm), and RS data and topographic factors are combined with machine learning to construct a comprehensive soil salinity estimation model based on gray correlation analysis. The results are as follows: (1) The optimal spectral index (2D, 3D) can effectively consider possible combinations of the bands between the interaction effects and responding to sensitive bands of soil properties to circumvent the problem of applicability of spectral indices in different regions; (2) Both the Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI multispectral RS data sources, after the first-order derivative techniques are all processed, show improvements in the prediction accuracy of the model; (3) The best performance/accuracy of the predictive model is for sentinel data under first-order derivatives. This study compared the capabilities of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI in RS prediction in finding the potential application of derivatives to RS prediction of salinized soils, with the results providing some theoretical basis and technical guidance for salinized soil prediction and environmental management planning.

TI  - Super-resolution method using generative adversarial network for Gaofen wide-field-view images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the spatial distribution of crops is of great significance for scientific research and production practices. Such accurate information can be extracted from high-spatial-resolution optical remote sensing images. However, acquiring these images with a wide coverage is difficult. We established a model named multispectral super-resolution generative adversarial network (MS_SRGAN) for generating high-resolution 4-m images using Gaofen 1 wide-field-view (WFV) 16-m images. The MS_SRGAN model contains a generator and a discriminator. The generator network is composed of feature extraction units and feature fusion units with a symmetric structure, and the attention mechanism is introduced to constrain the spectral value of the feature map during feature extraction. The generator loss introduces feature loss to describe the feature difference of the image. This is realized using pre-trained discriminator parameters and a partial discriminator network. In addition to realizing feature loss, the discriminator network, which is a simple convolutional neural network, also realizes adversarial loss. Adversarial loss can provide some fake high frequency details to the generator to get a more sharpened image. In the Gaofen 1 WFV image test, the performance of MS_SRGAN was compared with that of Bicubic, EDSR, SRGAN, and ESRGAN. The results show that the spectral angle mapper (3.387) and structural similarity index measure (0.998) of MS_SRGAN are higher than those of the other models. In addition, the image obtained by MS_SRGAN is more realistic; its texture details and color distribution are closer to the reference image to a greater extent. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Spatial modeling and susceptibility zonation of landslides using random forest, naive bayes and K-nearest neighbor in a complicated terrain
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, one of the most frequent natural hazards around several regions in the world is the landslide events. The area of Jabal Farasan in the northwest Jeddah of Saudi Arabia suffers from landslide events. The main cause of these events was identified due to the anthropogenic activities represented by mining activities. In this work, different machine learning algorithms (MLA), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) were implemented to predict the landslides events integrated with remote sensing data. The objective is to generate landslides susceptibility prediction map using different MLA. The landslides inventory map was prepared in the present study based on the historical landslide's events. Landslides at 1354 locations were used to train the models and validate the prediction. Landslides controlling factors include: elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, distance from roads, lineaments density, and topographic wetness index (TWI). Our findings indicate that landslides more likely occurs in the areas of mining activities, close to the roads and the Wadi tributaries due to the high slope angle in some cases. Subsequently, the prediction maps were classified into landslide occurrence location and non-landslides occurrence's model's validation using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the model accuracy varied between 86 and 89% for RF, KNN, and NB. The produced landslide susceptibility map in this study would provide useful information for hazard management and control in such natural hazards.

TI  - Spatial and decadal prediction of land use/land cover using multi-layer perceptron-neural network (MLP-NN) algorithm for a semi-arid region of Asir, Saudi Arabia
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study uses Landsat satellite images of 1990, 2000 and 2018 to identify the land-use changes. Multilayer perceptron-neural network based land change modelling (LCM) has been applied to model future land-use/land cover (LULC). The prediction model has been validated using simulated and classified LULC maps of 2018 which resulted into an overall accuracy of 88%. The results indicate 389.27% increase in built-up area as the prominent land-use change during 1990-2018 and an increase of 56.25% in built-up area is forecasted during the year 2018-2040. Land absorption coefficient and land consumption rate indices, used to characterize urban expansion, indicate continued compact built-up structure during 1990-2018 due to population increase. The observations derived from this study would be useful as it will help the regional planners with forecasted land-use beforehand in planning the built-up and abundantly available natural resources in the area according to the increasing future demands.

TI  - How Do Pathologists in Academic Institutions Across the United States and Canada Evaluate Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer? A Practice Survey
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: There are little data on how changes in the clinical management of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer have influenced pathologist evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes.Methods: A 14-question survey was sent to Canadian and US breast pathologists at academic institutions (AIs).Results: Pathologists from 23 AIs responded. Intraoperative evaluation (IOE) is performed for selected cases in 9 AIs, for almost all in 10, and not performed in 4. Thirteen use frozen sections (FSs) alone. During IOE, perinodal fat is completely trimmed in 8, not trimmed in 9, and variable in 2. For FS, in 12 the entire node is submitted at 2-mm intervals. Preferred plane of sectioning is parallel to the long axis in 8 and perpendicular in 12. In 11, a single H&E slide is obtained, whereas 12 opt for multiple levels. In 11, cytokeratin is obtained if necessary, and immunostains are routine in 10. Thirteen consider tumor cells in pericapsular lymphatics as lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and 10 consider it isolated tumor cells (ITCs).Conclusions: There is dichotomy in practice with nearequal support for routine vs case-by-case multilevel/ immunostain evaluation, perpendicular vs parallel sectioning, complete vs incomplete fat removal, and tumor in pericapsular lymphatics as LVI vs ITCs.

TI  - Sentinel-1 soil moisture at 1 km resolution: a validation study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an assessment of a pre-operational soil moisture product at 1 km resolution derived from satellite data acquired by the European Radar Observatory Sentinel-1 (S-1), representing the first space component of the Copernicus program. The product consists of an estimate of surface soil volumetric water content Theta [m(3)/m(3)] and its uncertainty [m(3)/m(3)], both at 1 km. The retrieval algorithm relies on a time series based Short Term Change Detection (STCD) approach, taking advantage of the frequent revisit of the S-1 constellation that performs C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The performance of the S-1 Theta product is estimated through a direct comparison between 1068 S-1 Theta images against in situ Theta measurements acquired by 167 ground stations located in Europe, America and Australia, over 4 years between January 2015 and December 2020, depending on the site. The paper develops a method to estimate the spatial representativeness error (SRE) that arises from the mismatch between the S-1 Theta retrieved at 1 km resolution and the in situ point-scale Theta observations. The impact of SRE on standard validation metrics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (R) and linear regression, is quantified and experimentally assessed using S-1 and ground Theta data collected over a dense hydrologic network (4-5 stations/km(2)) located in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). Results show that for the dense hydrological network the RMSE and correlation are similar to 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and 0.71, respectively, whereas for the sparse hydrological networks, i.e., 1 station/km(2), the SRE increases the RMSE by similar to 0.02 m(3)/m(3) (70% Confidence Level). Globally, the S-1 Theta product is characterized by an intrinsic (i.e., with SRE removed) RMSE of similar to 0.07 m(3)/m(3) over the Theta range [0.03, 0.60] m(3)/m(3) and R of 0.54. A breakdown of the RMSE per dry, medium and wet Theta ranges is also derived and its implications for setting realistic requirements for SAR-based Theta retrieval are discussed together with recommendations for the density of in situ Theta observations.

TI  - Aluminium adjuvants in vaccines-A way to modulate the immune response
T2  - SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aluminium salts have been used as adjuvants in vaccines for almost a century, but still no clear understanding of the mechanisms behind the immune stimulating properties of aluminium based adjuvants is recognized. Aluminium adjuvants consist of aggregates and upon administration of a vaccine, the aggregates will be recognized and phagocytosed by sentinel cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells. The adjuvant aggregates will persist intracellularly, maintaining a saturated intracellular concentration of aluminium ions over an extended time. Macrophages and dendritic cells are pivotal cells of the innate immune system, linking the innate and adaptive immune systems, and become inflammatory and antigen-presenting upon activation, thus mediating the initiation of the adaptive immune system. Both types of cell are highly adaptable, and this review will discuss and highlight how the occurrence of intracellular aluminium ions over an extended time may induce the polarization of macrophages into inflammatory and antigen presenting M1 macrophages by affecting the: endosomal pH; formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); stability of the phagosomal membrane; release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs); and metabolism (metabolic re-programming). This review emphasizes that a persistent intracellular presence of aluminium ions over an extended time has the potential to affect the functionality of sentinel cells of the innate immune system, inducing polarization and activation. The immune stimulating properties of aluminium adjuvants is presumably mediated by several discrete events, however, a persistent intracellular presence of aluminium ions appears to be a key factor regarding the immune stimulating properties of aluminium based adjuvants.

TI  - Active fire detection in Landsat-8 imagery: A large-scale dataset and a deep-learning study
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Active fire detection in satellite imagery is of critical importance to the management of environmental conservation policies, supporting decision-making and law enforcement. This is a well established field, with many techniques being proposed over the years, usually based on pixel or region-level comparisons involving sensor-specific thresholds and neighborhood statistics. In this paper, we address the problem of active fire detection using deep learning techniques. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been enjoying an enormous success in many fields, but their use for active fire detection is relatively new, with open questions and demand for datasets and architectures for evaluation. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a new large-scale dataset for active fire detection, with over 150,000 image patches (more than 200 GB of data) extracted from Landsat-8 images captured around the world in August and September 2020, containing wildfires in several locations. The dataset was split in two parts, and contains 10-band spectral images with associated outputs, produced by three well known handcrafted algorithms for active fire detection in the first part, and manually annotated masks in the second part. We also present a study on how different convolutional neural network architectures can be used to approximate these handcrafted algorithms, and how models trained on automatically segmented patches can be combined to achieve better performance than the original algorithms - with the best combination having 87.2% precision and 92.4% recall on our manually annotated dataset. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models are available on Github (https://github.com/pereira-gha/activefire), creating opportunities for further advances in the field.

TI  - Resting Behavior of Blood-Fed Females and Host Feeding Preferences of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Morphological Forms in Senegal
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector of most arboviruses in tropical and subtropical urban areas. In West Africa, particularly in Senegal, domestic and wild populations have been described. Both Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) and Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf) were found in progenies of Ae. aegypti families from several localities of Senegal. However, nothing is known about their resting and trophic behavior, which are key data for vector control. To fill this gap, blood-fed mosquitoes were collected monthly indoors and outdoors with BackPack aspirators and BG-Sentinel 2 traps between July and November 2019 from four urban sites. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to analyze blood-fed Aaa and Aaf specimens. Both forms were found resting in all investigated places with the highest proportions found in scrap metals (51.7% for Aaa and 44.1% for Aaf) and used tires (19.2% for Aaa and 26.1% for Aaf). Blood-fed Aaf females showed lower occupation of the indoors environment compared to Aaa. Overall, the percentages of single bloodmeals from human were 80.5% (916/1138) for Aaa and 71.1% (263/370) for Aaf. A low frequency of other domestic hosts, including bovine, ovine, and cat were detected for both forms. This study provides the first data on resting and trophic behavior of Aaa and Aaf in Senegal. Both forms showed differences in their resting behavior but fed primarily on human and highlight the risk of arboviruses transmission in urban areas.

TI  - Recent advancements in multi-temporal methods applied to new generation SAR systems and applications in South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and continuous monitoring of Earth's ground surface changes, triggered by natural phenomena or induced by human activities, is nowadays possible using Earth Observation (EO) technologies. Indeed, the exploitation of remotely sensed data collected by constellations of new-generation satellite platforms, complemented with in-situ measurements and ground-based observation systems, represents a well-established practice to get valuable information on Earth's crust and subsurface dynamics. The effects of extreme natural or man-induced events (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding phenomena, sea-level rise, big fires, etc.) have severe societal and economic impacts. In particular, the technologies based on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images reached significant improvements in the last decade due to the growing availability of vast amounts of data collected by multiple-satellite sensors operating at different frequency bands and with complementary viewing angles, polarization and acquisition modes. Accordingly, to process a large amount of SAR data in a timely fashion, up-to-date high-performance computing (HPC) methods and tools are required. This paper addresses the state-of-the-art of SAR technologies for the analysis of long sequences of multiple sets of SAR images and provides a perspective on the forthcoming improvements of these technologies. In particular, the emphasis is placed on novel interferometric SAR and change detection methods, giving an overview of how those processing techniques have been used for investigating sites located in South and Central America. Moreover, an overview of the new generation of SAR sensors' observational capability, especially in the field of ground deformation analysis for mitigating the risk associated with natural and human-induced hazards, is provided. COSMO-SkyMed, ALOS, Sentinel-1, and SAOCOM data are exploited to show how natural and human-induced terrain displacement phenomena can be detected and investigated in different portions (X-, L- and C-band) of the microwave spectrum using SAR technologies.

TI  - A Bayesian approach towards daily pan-Arctic sea ice freeboard estimates from combined CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 satellite observations
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of sea ice freeboard from satellite radar altimeters are crucial in the derivation of sea ice thickness estimates, which in turn provide information on sea ice forecasts, volume budgets, and productivity rates. Current spatio-temporal resolution of radar freeboard is limited as 30 d are required in order to generate pan-Arctic coverage from CryoSat-2 and 27 d are required from Sentinel-3 satellites. This therefore hinders our ability to understand physical processes that drive sea ice thickness variability on sub-monthly timescales. In this study we exploit the consistency between CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-3B radar free-boards in order to produce daily gridded pan-Arctic free-board estimates between December 2018 and April 2019. We use the Bayesian inference approach of Gaussian process regression to learn functional mappings between radar free-board observations in space and time and to subsequently retrieve pan-Arctic freeboard as well as uncertainty estimates. We also employ an empirical Bayesian approach towards learning the free (hyper)parameters of the model, which allows us to derive daily estimates related to radar free-board spatial and temporal correlation length scales. The estimated daily radar freeboard predictions are, on average across the 2018-2019 season, equivalent to CryoSat-2 and Sentinel3 freeboards to within 1 mm (standard deviations < 6 cm), and cross-validation experiments show that errors in predictions are, on average, <= 4 mm across the same period. We also demonstrate the improved temporal variability of a pan-Arctic daily product by comparing time series of the predicted freeboards, with 31 d running means from CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards, across nine sectors of the Arctic, as well as making comparisons with daily ERA5 snow- fall data. Pearson correlations between daily radar freeboard anomalies and snowfall are as high as +0.52 over first-year ice and +0.41 over multi-year ice, suggesting that the estimated daily fields are able to capture real physical radar freeboard variability at sub-weekly timescales.

TI  - Extraction of Absolute Water Level Using TanDEM-X Bistatic Observations With a Large Perpendicular Baseline
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of Wetland synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) has often been restricted in practical hydrological monitoring because it is based on relative estimates of water level changes between two synthetic aperture radar acquisitions, as opposed to absolute water levels obtained by ground measurements. TanDEM-X bistatic observations can provide absolute water level estimates using simultaneous phase measurements by a two-satellite constellation with TerraSAR-X. We evaluated two datasets of TanDEM-X bistatic observations acquired during an experimental science phase on August 26 and 31, 2015, with a very large baseline configuration to extract absolute water levels of Everglades wetland in southern Florida, USA. The perpendicular baselines are 1.43 and 1.36 km, and the ambiguities of height were calculated as 3.61 and 3.90 m in each interferometric pair, respectively. Hourly water level measurements provided by the Everglades depth estimation network (EDEN) were used to verify the estimated absolute water levels. Several stage stations located in densely vegetated areas that showed incoherence were excluded from the verification as outliers. The verification results show an excellent agreement (degree of determination > 0.95) between the InSAR derived absolute water levels and the stage station measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the TanDEM-X results and stage records was 0.77 and 0.66 m, respectively. Severe volume decorrelations over the vegetated area, owing to the large perpendicular baselines, were detected, despite near zero temporal baseline of the bistatic observations. The absolute water levels can be used as excellent constraints for wetland surface flow models.

TI  - Evaluation of whole axillary status with lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study aims to evaluate the whole axillary status of patients with breast cancer by lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (LCEUS). Methods LCEUS was applied for 169 patients with suspected breast cancer. Abnormal patterns in lymphatic channels, sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), and non-enhanced but abnormal lymph nodes were investigated. The signs of distorted, attenuated, netted, or interrupted lymphatic channels, defective-filling or no-filling SLNs, and the appearance of non-enhanced but abnormal lymph nodes were designated as features of axillary metastasis. A positive outcome was given when any of the abnormal patterns was found in the LCEUS. The diagnostic efficiencies were calculated to differentiate the axillary lymphatic status using LCEUS for the whole axilla, compared with conventional ultrasound (US) and LCEUS for SLNs. Results The LCEUS procedure was successfully performed for 157 breast cancer patients with axillary dissection. Compared to normal axillae, abnormal patterns had a significantly higher frequency in metastatic axillae (p = 0.000). Using conventional US to evaluate the whole axillae, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 69.1%, 71.9%, and 70.7%, respectively. When LCEUS was used for SLN evaluation to predict the whole axilla, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 66.2%, 89.9%, and 79.6%, respectively. When LCEUS was used as the whole axillary evaluation method, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 76.5%, 86.5%, and 82.2%, respectively. Conclusion LCEUS can be an accurate method to observe the whole axillae in breast cancer patients. Lymphatic channels, SLNs, and non-enhanced but abnormal lymph nodes constitute the LCEUS for whole axillary evaluation.

TI  - Prediction of fugitive landfill gas hotspots using a random forest algorithm and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane from landfill gas is an important contributor of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Regular monitoring of fugitive landfill methane hotspots is of great practical and environmental importance. The Toronto Green lane landfill is selected in this study, and an analytical approach was developed to identify fugitive gas emission hotspots using the higher resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and a random forest (RF) algorithm. Landsat-8 imagery is traditionally used to identify landfill emission hotspots; however, the resulting spatial resolution is often inadequate for increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Various statistical, climatological, and spectral variables on final model performance were examined. The proposed RF approach reduced data spread, with standard deviations between 84.8% to 99.0%. The presence of water vapor might reduce the accuracy of spectral reflectance and lower model performance. The most significant bands in constructing the RF model are Sentinel-2 spectral band 1 and band 9, with a relative importance of 1.0 and 0.8, respectively. Results showed that the predicted land surface temperatures (LSTs) agree well with LSTs estimated from a conventional approach using Landsat-8 imagery, with R > 0.96. The proposed method maps the fugitive gas emission hotspots at the Green lane landfill with a higher spatial resolution.

TI  - Assessment of climate change effects on alpine summit vegetation in the transition of tropical to subtropical humid climate
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems are globally among the most vulnerable to the impacts of global warming. This study is carried out on high-mountain summits dominated by dwarf bamboo, Yushania niitakayamensis, in the alpine zone of subtropical Taiwan. A total of six summits were selected using a multi-summit approach, following the common protocol of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA). To assess the climate change effects, we used the soil temperature and statistical downscaling precipitation data to analyze the climatic changing patterns, also applied enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and vegetation diversity index to assess the vegetation responses among summits along the timeline. The results showed that the temperature has a significant increase in all summits, especially in winter. The annual chilling days have reduced around 50% from 2010 to 2019, which would imply the extension of plant growing season. The EVI values showed a tendency to increase over time. Furthermore, the long-term trend of EVI had an abnormal drop in 2018. This coincided with low precipitation and extremely high temperature in the early growing season, which may have caused water shortage and a decline in plant growth. Although the temperature was increasing significantly, the species diversity was slightly increasing in the first survey, but significantly decreased in the third survey. We suggest that the increase in temperature and the extension of the growing season might have led to the expansion of the bamboo species Y. niitakayamensis. Its expansion, combined with an extreme climate event could have caused the decline in species diversity.

TI  - Tracking short-term seasonally flooded areas to understand the dynamics of the Coatzacoalcos River in Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of rivers based on remote sensing data provides an opportunity for the observation of the natural dynamics of water and flood conditions. Taking advantage of the availability of radar data, we describe a methodology used to detect the river's water surface flooding patterns and the size of floods using observations from Sentinel-1 imagery. With the proposed methodology, characteristics of the river's normal average riverbed surface are determined, as well as the flood footprint. As a case study, it shows the annual and interannual water variability at the lower Coatzacoalcos Basin in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. This site was chosen after considering the evidence of seasonal flooding and the changes that happened during the 2015 to 2017 period. Our paper details the results on surface changes during this time period. The results on water surface cover have been validated through different sources of information to confirm the ability to differentiate flood areas and know the maximum flood extensions. An agreement above 92% is estimated to be reached with the use of the evaluated maps of binary water/no-water. Recurrent flood areas were detected where water remained during one or several weeks during the month of October, both in 2015 and 2017. Finally, a change in the extent of water maps in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals is achieved with the integration of historical data over time and space of the natural behavior of the rivers in the case study.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Dynamics in Response to Land-Use/Land-Cover Change in the Coastal City of Mumbai
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization and land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes have resulted in the unplanned and unsustainable growth of the Indian cities. This has resulted in a number of environmental issues such as escalating the urban heat island (UHI) intensity over the cities. Therefore, this study was designed to model and quantify the UHI dynamics of Mumbai city in response to the LU/LC change during 1991-2018 using temporal Landsat datasets. The result shows a significant decline in vegetation cover from 215.8 to 129.27 km(2), while the built-up areas have almost doubled, i.e., from 173.09 to 346.02 km(2) in the Mumbai city during 1991-2018. As a consequence of this, a significant increase in the LST has been noticed in both urban heat island (UHI) and non-UHI zones. Although the areas under UHI zones have not increased significantly, the land surface temperature (LST) gap (difference between minimum and maximum LST) has declined in the Mumbai city from 30.04 degrees C in 1991 to 20.7 degrees C in 2018. Further, the minimum and mean LST over each LU/LC classes have also shown a significant increase. On the other hand, the regression analysis shows that the association between UHI and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) has increased in the city, while the association of vegetation density (NDVI) and normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) has declined in the city. The study can provide useful insights into the process of urban planning and policy makings for urban spatial planning and UHI mitigation strategies.

TI  - Vignettes to Illustrate the Value of Tumor Biobanks in Cancer Research in Canada
T2  - BIOPRESERVATION AND BIOBANKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tumor biobanks are a common research infrastructure. As a collection of biospecimens and annotated data collected to support a multitude of research projects, biobanks facilitate access to materials that are the critical fuel for the generation of data in up to 40% of cancer research publications. However, quantifying how to measure biobanks' impact and their value on the field of cancer research discoveries and findings, has not been well elucidated. Methods: We have used a qualitative case study approach to illustrate the impact of tumor biobanks. We assessed the impact of three research studies published between 2010 and 2012 that required easily accessible "classic" biobanks. Each study utilized preassembled collections of tumor biospecimens with associated patient outcomes data at the outset of the research project. We compared the resulting journal impact factor, altmetric and field-weighted citation impact factor scores for each article to a set of six "benchmark" articles that represent cancer research and treatment discoveries from the same time period and two sentinel scientific discovery articles. Results: We developed a value model using a literature search and design-thinking methodologies to illustrate the contributions of these "classic" model biobanks to these research studies. Assessment of the three example articles supported by biobanks demonstrates that the output can have impact that is comparable to the impact of a set of benchmark articles describing milestones in the field of cancer research and cancer care. Conclusions: These case studies illustrate the value of the sustained investment of funds, planning, time, and effort on the part of the biobanks before the conduct of the research study to be able to ultimately support high-value research. The "value" model will enable further discussion around impact and may be useful in better delineating qualitative metrics of biobank value in the future.

TI  - Demographic responses to environmental change of the black-browed albatross, sentinel of the Patagonian Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In long-lived marine top-predators with delayed sexual maturity such as seabirds, adult survival is predicted to drive population dynamics. Major knowledge gaps exist for the cryptic sub-adult stages of the population. Yet as the oceans undergo dramatic change, investigating the trends of top-predator populations and their responses to environmental variability is key for a process-based understanding of climate change. Using integrated population models based on a longitudinal data set spanning nearly 2 decades, we investigated the demographic rates and environmental drivers shaping the dynamics of a longevous marine top-predator population, the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris in the Falklands. We quantified the dynamics of the whole population, including its cryptic sub-adult stages, and examined the effects of candidate environmental covariates on adult survival and productivity parameters. We found that high survival rates of both adults and juveniles are the main contributors to the growth of this albatross population, the only one that is increasing in the South Atlantic. The breeding parameters were affected by environmental fluctuations through bottom-up processes, with a negative effect of higher sea surface temperatures and a positive effect of wind intensity. The relatively constant adult survival was influenced by deeper ecosystem changes, captured by large-scale indices (Southern Annular Mode). Approximately half of the total population is composed of sub-adults, and the population dynamics are highly sensitive to changes in juvenile survival; addressing current knowledge gaps in these cryptic life-history stages is therefore a conservation goal of primary importance.

TI  - Impacts of juniper woody plant encroachment into grasslands on local climate
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands has been exacerbated by climate change and human activities. WPE may affect local climate by altering the exchange of mass and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. The lack of studies on the effects of WPE on local climate hinders our understanding of the interactions between changes in regional vegetation cover and climate. Here, we analyzed the differences of land surface temperature (Delta LST), albedo (Delta Albedo) and evapotranspiration (Delta ET) between juniper-woody-encroached grasslands and adjacent pure grasslands using 16-years of remote sensing data. Our results showed that juniper woody plant encroachment (JWPE) into the semi-arid and sub-humid grasslands reduced daytime LST and albedo, but increased nighttime LST and ET from an annual scale analysis. With each one percent increase in juniper cover, annual mean daytime Delta LST decreased similar to 0.026 degrees C, nighttime Delta LST increased similar to 0.01 degrees C, daily Delta LST decreased similar to 0.008 degrees C, Delta albedo decreased similar to 0.053%, and Delta ET increased similar to 1.31 mm/year. Furthermore, it is suggested that the impacts of JWPE on LST and ET were stronger in dry years than in normal and pluvial years, and that no significant variations in albedo were found among the different hydrological conditions. These results provide insights into applying satellite-based techniques to understand the feedbacks between woody vegetation dynamics and local climate change.

TI  - Mountain-wave-induced polar stratospheric clouds and their representation in the global chemistry model ICON-ART
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are a driver for ozone depletion in the lower polar stratosphere. They provide surface for heterogeneous reactions activating chlorine and bromine reservoir species during the polar night. The large-scale effects of PSCs are represented by means of parameterisations in current global chemistry-climate models, but one process is still a challenge: the representation of PSCs formed locally in conjunction with unresolved mountain waves. In this study, we investigate direct simulations of PSCs formed by mountain waves with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) with its extension for Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases (ART) including local grid refinements (nesting) with two-way interaction. Here, the nesting is set up around the Antarctic Peninsula, which is a well-known hot spot for the generation of mountain waves in the Southern Hemisphere. We compare our model results with satellite measurements of PSCs from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and gravity wave observations of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). For a mountain wave event from 19 to 29 July 2008 we find similar structures of PSCs as well as a fairly realistic development of the mountain wave between the satellite data and the ICON-ART simulations in the Antarctic Peninsula nest. We compare a global simulation without nesting with the nested configuration to show the benefits of adding the nesting. Although the mountain waves cannot be resolved explicitly at the global resolution used (about 160 km), their effect from the nested regions (about 80 and 40 km) on the global domain is represented. Thus, we show in this study that the ICON-ART model has the potential to bridge the gap between directly resolved mountain-wave-induced PSCs and their representation and effect on chemistry at coarse global resolutions.

TI  - Estimating subpixel turbulent heat flux over leads from MODIS thermal infrared imagery with deep learning
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The turbulent heat flux (THF) over leads is an important parameter for climate change monitoring in the Arctic region. THF over leads is often calculated from satellite-derived ice surface temperature (IST) products, in which mixed pixels containing both ice and open water along lead boundaries reduce the accuracy of calculated THF. To address this problem, this paper proposes a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to estimate THF over leads at the subpixel scale (DeepSTHF) based on remotely sensed images The proposed DeepSTHF provides an IST image and the corresponding lead map with a finer spatial resolution than the input IST image so that the subpixel-scale THF can be estimated from them. The proposed approach is verified using simulated and real Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images and compared with the conventional cubic interpolation and pixelbased methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-based method can effectively estimate subpixel-scale information from the coarse data and performs well in producing fine-spatial-resolution IST images and lead maps, thereby providing more accurate and reliable THF over leads.

TI  - Estimating 250-m Land Surface and Atmospheric Variables From MERSI Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI) onboard China's new generation of polar-orbiting meteorological satellite series FengYun-3 (FY-3) is providing global observations of the Earth's environment. One of the important characteristics of the MERSI sensor is that it has four bands at 250-m spatial resolution. However, very few high-level land surface and atmospheric products have been generated from MERSI data. This article presents an effective optimization method to estimate the continuous temporal distribution of multiple land surface and atmospheric variables at a 250-m spatial resolution from time series FY-3B MERSI top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. The MODIS cloud detection method was applied to the MERSI TOA reflectance to determine the clear observations. Then, a physics-based BRDF correction was adopt to reduce the topographic effects using the slope angle and aspect angle of the slope. Finally, a coupled land surface-atmosphere radiative transfer (RT) model and the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) optimization algorithm were used to estimate a suit of variables, including the leaf area index (LAI), the aerosol optical depth (AOD), the cloud optical thickness (COT), the cloud effective particle radius (CER), the land surface reflectance, the shortwave and visible albedo, the incident shortwave radiation (ISR), the incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of absorbed PAR (FAPAR), the surface broadband emissivity (BBE), and the TOA shortwave albedo. The method was applied to the data from the 18 SURFRAD, the America FluxNet (AmeriFlux), and the Images and Beijing Normal University net (BNUnet) sites. All the estimated variables were also compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. The estimated LAI, PAR, FAPAR, shortwave albedo, and ISR were also validated using ground measurements from the selected sites. The results show that our method can simultaneously estimate multiple temporally continuous variables in both clear- and cloudy-sky conditions, with an accuracy comparable to those of MODIS and GLASS products. The estimated LAI, PAR, FAPAR, shortwave albedo, and ISR are consistent with the field measurements, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.692, 0.783, 0.788, 0.559, and 0.833, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.427, 56.681 W/m(2), 0.092, 0.084, and 115.305 W/m(2), respectively. The proposed algorithm can effectively estimate the instantaneous atmospheric and land surface variables directly from satellite observations without cumbersome atmospheric corrections. Moreover, it can potentially be applied to multiple satellite observations.

TI  - Unsupervised Change Detection of Multispectral Images Based on PCA and Low-Rank Prior
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a new unsupervised change detection method based on low-rank prior for multispectral images. It is assumed that the changed and unchanged pixels are from different subspaces due to different appearance and statistical properties. So, low-rank representation (LRR) is employed to find informative pixels from the superpixels of the difference image (DI). Besides, taking the sparsity of changed pixels in the observed scenes into consideration, the selection rule is designed to distinguish these pixels. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for the training of changed and unchanged dictionaries from these pixels. Finally, the change map is estimated by comparing the reconstruction error of each pixel in DI on changed and unchanged dictionaries. By LRR, more representative pixels are found for subsequent dictionary learning, which can efficiently improve the performance of the proposed method. Experiments on multitemporal images from the Landsat satellite demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - The roles of machine learning methods in limiting the spread of deadly diseases: A systematic review
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Review
AB  - Machine learning (ML) methods can be leveraged to prevent the spread of deadly infectious disease outbreak (e.g., COVID-19). This can be done by applying machine learning methods in predicting and detecting the deadly infectious disease. Most reviews did not discuss about the machine learning algorithms, datasets and performance measurements used for various applications in predicting and detecting the deadly infectious disease. In contrast, this paper outlines the literature review based on two major ways (e.g., prediction, detection) to limit the spread of deadly disease outbreaks. Hence, this study aims to investigate the state of the art, challenges and future works of leveraging ML methods to detect and predict deadly disease outbreaks according to two categories mentioned earlier. Specifically, this study provides a review on various approaches (e.g., individual and ensemble models), types of datasets, parameters or variables and performance measures used in the previous works. The literature review included all articles from journals and conference proceedings published from 2010 through 2020 in Scopus indexed databases using the search terms Predicting Disease Outbreaks and/or Detecting Disease using Machine Learning. The findings from this review focus on commonly used machine learning approaches, challenges and future works to limit the spread of deadly disease outbreaks through preventions and detections.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change as a result of rapid urban expansion cause land surface temperature (LST) variations. The study aims to analyze urban LULC change and its impact on the seasonal, spatial and temporal Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) of Addis Ababa city and its surrounding from 1987 to 2019 using Landsat images. The result indicates that the Impervious Surface (IS) of Addis Ababa city and the surroundings have expanded from 81.49 km(2) in 1987 to 591.85 km(2) in 2019 with a 6.2% rate of change. On the other hand, vegetation cover which has a high thermal cooling effect has been degraded from 217.66 km(2) in 1987 to 157.8 km(2) in 2019. The spatial pattern of LST increased from northern highlands towards southern lowlands. The mean temperature for January and February 1987 was 26.22 degrees C and 27.76 degrees C, respectively. On 25 January 2002, the study area exhibited the mean LST of 28.25 degrees C, whereas on 26 February 2002, the mean temperature was increased to 31.26 degrees C. On 16 January 2019, the mean LST was 31.14 degrees C, whereas on 1 February declined to 30.62 degrees C. The study area exhibited a high mean LST on 21 March 2019 which was 36.1 degrees C, whereas on 15 October 2019 the mean LST was 25.41 degrees C. The study shows that very high LST exhibited on fallow land (27.78, 30.39 and 33.38 degrees C), crop (26.5, 28.66 and 30.83 degrees C), grassland (26.52, 28.53 and 31.15 degrees C) and IS (26.58, 28.38 and 31.39 degrees C) while low LST found on vegetation cover (22.76, 21.64 and 24.44 degrees C in 1987, 2002 and 2019, respectively). The mean LST has a positive correlation with fraction of IS (R-2 = 0.5152, 0.5855, 0.7184), CL (R-2 = 0.716, 0.6294, 0.7089), FL (R-2 = 0.6373, 0.6138, 0.8667) and GL (R-2 = 0.6513, 0.6073, 0.6442) while negative with VC (R-2 = 0.6295, 0.5601, 0.6357 in 1987, 2002 and 2019, respectively). The mean LST that exhibited in Z1 and Z2 was 25.47 and 26.91 degrees C, 26.06 and 28.88 degrees C, and 29.43 and 32.33 degrees C in 1987, 2002, and 2019, respectively. The IS declined when moving from the center to the peripheral area and the mean LST increased towards the rural area along urban-rural zones (URZs). In the north-south direction along URZs, the minimum and maximum mean LST in January increased from 15.83 degrees C in 1987 to 18.57 degrees C in 2019 and 33.64 degrees C in 1987 to 35.58 degrees C in 2019, respectively. Besides, the minimum and maximum mean LST for February in 1987 and 2019 was 17.57 degrees C and 18.97 degrees C and 32.82 degrees C and 35.21 degrees C, respectively. The minimum mean temperature also increased from 18.24 degrees C to 23.4 degrees C, and maximum mean LST from 32.84 degrees C to 41.9 degrees C from October to March 2019. Along east-west direction, the minimum and maximum mean LST in January was found 18.48 degrees C and 30.8 degrees C in 1987 while it was increased to 23.66 degrees C and 35.69 degrees C in 2019, respectively. The minimum and maximum mean LST in February was also increased from 20.17 to 23.57 degrees C and 30.81 to 34.91 degrees C from 1987 to 2019, respectively. Along northeast-southwest direction, the minimum mean LST in January 1987 was 16.17 degrees C and increased to 18.16 degrees C in 2019, whereas the maximum mean temperature increased from 32.1 degrees C in 1987 to 36.06 degrees C in 2019.The minimum mean LST in February 1987 was 19.43 degrees C and decreased to 18.5 celcius in 2019, whereas the maximum value raised from 32.07 degrees C in 1987 to 36.85 degrees C in 2019. The pattern of LST decreased when moving to URZ60 to URZ90 in the northwest direction of the city center and increased city center to URZ47 and city center to URZ165 in the southeast direction. The study revealed that SUHII was highly concentrated in the urban area than the peripheral area. Therefore, to reduce SUHI and to have a sound environment, vegetation cover with dense trees canopy and greenery areas covered with grasses and trees are very important for the city and the surrounding.

TI  - Early reflector localization improves the accuracy of localization and excision of a previously positive axillary lymph node following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Clipped axillary lymph node (CALN) localization after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for axillary node positive breast cancer can be difficult due to significant shrinkage or disappearance of the CALN after NAC. This study compares wire localization to a radar-based localization system utilizing a reflector that can be placed before or during NAC, in the months before definitive surgery, to facilitate accurate localization and excision of the CALN. Methods Between 2016 and 2019, women with T0-4 N1-3 M0 breast cancer who underwent NAC followed by axillary surgery with planned excision of a biopsy positive or clinically suspicious axillary node via wire or reflector localization were identified. A retrospective chart review was performed comparing successful localization and CALN retrieval by each localization technique. Results Ninety-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Forty-two patients underwent wire localization while 57 patients underwent reflector localization of the CALN. Successful identification of the CALN by wire or reflector was equivalent (83.3% vs 84.2%, respectively). Twenty-two reflectors placed before or during early/mid NAC (early placement) had 100% successful CALN localization and retrieval in the OR. Placement of wire or reflector localization devices within 8 weeks of surgery (late placement) only resulted in 79.2% localization success (p = .02). Conclusion This study suggests a benefit of axillary lymph node reflector placement in the early NAC setting. Early reflector placement allows for more accurate excision of the CALN during axillary surgery after NAC as compared to placement of localization wires or reflectors in the few weeks prior to surgery.

TI  - Land use/land cover dynamics and perception of the local communities in Bita district, south western Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human settlements and swift expansion of agriculture have simplified the natural ecosystems and causing the loss of copious biological diversity. The current study was conducted in Bita district, southwestern Ethiopia to examine the pattern of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics using multispectral satellite data for the years 1973, 1986, 2000 and 2018. The remote-sensed data were processed using ERDAS imagine 2014, ArcGIS map 10.5, and ENVI software. A supervised maximum likelihood classification algorithm was employed along with the visual interpretation of satellite images to classify each Landsat image into LULC categories. Semi-structured interviews and Focus Group Discussions were employed to identify major driving forces, impacts, and periodic LULC changes. The result revealed an alarming decrease in forestland but with an increase in the cropland. During the study periods, cropland, bareland and settlement areas have augmented by over 450% each. Conversely, grasslands and forestlands have reduced by over 45% each. The local communities perceived the population growth, and the expansion of coffee plantations and other croplands as the dominant drivers of LULC changes. The respondents also observed that the decline in forest cover triggered the loss of biodiversity, soil fertility and water availability. Decision-making on issues related to natural resource conservation, utilization and participatory resource management has to involve the engagement of the local community and other stakeholders. The deterioration in ecosystem services such as lack of benefits from medicinal plants from the forest, increase land degradation, and the decrease in water availability found to be the impacts of LULC change. This calls for a proper natural resource management plan and improvement in the livelihood of the community in the study area.

TI  - Regionwide temporal gradients of carbon allocation allow for shoot growth and latewood formation in boreal black spruce
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim In boreal ecosystems, phenological events display seasonal patterns. These patterns allow for the development of tissues during the short time window available for growth in cold climates. Primary and secondary growth, two expensive processes for plants, are supposedly modulated in time to optimize allocation of carbon to bud and woody tissues. We aimed to assess the phenology of primary and secondary meristems, testing their relationship over the closed black spruce stands of the commercially exploited forest region in Quebec, Canada. Location Quebec, Canada. Time period 2002-2016. Major taxa studied Gymnospermae. Methods We combined weekly scaled field observations with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract timings of photosynthesis and meristem growth in five black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] stands located along a latitudinal gradient and to assess their relationship. We then tested empirical models based on geographical position and seasonal temperatures to predict wood phenology (i.e., the onset and ending of earlywood and latewood formation), and compared its spatial patterns with existing predictions of bud phenology for the same study area. Results Photosynthesis started at the beginning of May, 3 weeks before bud reactivation and the onset of wood growth. Latewood formation started in mid-July, after shoot elongation was completed. For wood phenology models, the residual standard error ranged from 1 week to 12 days. Growth dynamics spatialized across the boreal forest of Quebec varied with the transition between the subarctic and humid continental climate. Main conclusions Shoot elongation and latewood formation were temporally separated, providing evidence of a trade-off in structural carbon allocation between primary and secondary growth in trees. Spatial patterns of wood phenology predicted for the black spruce polygons are consistent with spatial patterns of bud phenology, demonstrating synchronized temporal dynamics of meristems at the regional scale.

TI  - Continuous observations of forest canopy structure using low-cost digital camera traps
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing forest canopy dynamics is crucial for understanding the response of vegetation to environmental variability and change. While digital repeat photography is gaining increased attention for obtaining field phenology observations, colour indices derived from this method are often affected by leaf colour and actual canopy structure, complicating the physical interpretation of results. In addition, repeated photography requires power, storage capacity and remote data transfer, which are often limited in forest conditions. As an alternative, we tested a simple, cheap and fast solution to derive daily canopy structure observation from digital camera traps (CTs). Formerly deployed for wildlife monitoring, CTs are low-cost digital cameras designed for outdoor conditions and have low battery consumption, enable repeat acquisition, and often feature remote data transfer protocols.The trial was performed in a deciduous oak stand, where continuous images were acquired over a 1-year period using the time-lapse feature of the CT. Daily time series of canopy structure attributes were derived from the collected images using simple and automated procedures. Results were validated against reference manual cover photography measurements. The daily time series of foliage cover and leaf area index were then used to derive phenological transition dates, which were compared against phenological observations obtained from satellite Sentinel-2 data. Results indicated that field and satellite data provided comparable accuracy in determining the start of season (SOS). Larger discrepancies were found in determining the end of season (EOS), which can be attributed to the low number of good quality autumn images available from the satellite data. We concluded that CT is a robust method, which is ideally suited for routine, continuous field monitoring of canopy attributes and phenology. While this method can be used for evaluating remote sensing observations, the combination of CTs with satellite data holds great potential for greater spatiotemporal coverage, from field to landscape scales.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node assessment in breast cancer-an update on current recommendations
T2  - VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the preferred method of surgical pathological nodal staging of early breast cancer by the end of the nineties. As the most likely sites of metastasis, the SLNs allow a more precise staging, and indeed gross sectioning, step sectioning, immunohistochemistry, and molecular staging methods have been used to disclose metastatic involvement of these lymph nodes. This review summarizes the backgrounds of SLNB, trends in related surgery and pathology. It also gives an insight into European National recommendations related to SLN and divergent daily practices in European pathology departments, on the basis of replies to questionnaires from 84 pathologists from 38 European countries. The questionnaires revealed the post-neoadjuvant setting as an area where a significant minority of pathologists report less confidence in classifying residual nodal involvement into TNM categories. The review also summarizes the neoadjuvant therapy-related aspects of SLNB.

TI  - Long-term assessment of ecosystem services at ecological restoration sites using Landsat time series
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reversing ecological degradation through restoration activities is a key societal challenge of the upcoming decade. However, lack of evidence on the effectiveness of restoration interventions leads to inconsistent, delayed, or poorly informed statements of success, hindering the wise allocation of resources, representing a missed opportunity to learn from previous experiences. This study contributes to a better understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services at ecological restoration sites. We developed a method using Landsat satellite images combined with a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, and applied this to an arid rural landscape, the Baviaanskloof in South Africa. Since 1990, various restoration projects have been implemented to halt and reverse degradation. We applied the BACI approach at pixel-level comparing the conditions of each intervened pixel (impact) with 20 similar control pixels. By evaluating the conditions before and after the restoration intervention, we assessed the effectiveness of long-term restoration interventions distinguishing their impact from environmental temporal changes. The BACI approach was implemented with Landsat images that cover a 30-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 meter. We evaluated the impact of three interventions (revegetation, livestock exclusion, and the combination of both) on three ecosystem services; forage provision, erosion prevention, and presence of iconic vegetation. We also evaluated whether terrain characteristics could partially explain the variation in impact of interventions. The resulting maps showed spatial patterns of positive and negative effects of interventions on ecosystem services. Intervention effectiveness differed across vegetation conditions, terrain aspect, and soil parent material. Our method allows for spatially explicit quantification of the long-term restoration impact on ecosystem service supply, and for the detailed visualization of impact across an area. This pixel-level analysis is specifically suited for heterogeneous landscapes, where restoration impact not only varies between but also within restoration sites.

TI  - The unknownness of biodiversity: Its value and ethical significance for conservation action
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a consensus among scientists, conservationists and policy-makers that the diversity of life is a value that should be preserved. However, conservation concerns are usually not reducible to the protection of diversity. This raises the question: What are the specific reasons to protect biodiversity as diversity (if any)? Classical answers to this question refer to the value of diversity as insurance, to its links with stability or other valuable properties of ecosystems. In this article, we introduce an additional way to answer this question on the basis of eco-phenomenological analysis. Eco-phenomenology is a field of philosophy that explores our lived experience of the natural world, and its epistemological and ethical implications. So far, this approach has not been integrated with debates in conservation biology. Our article develops an eco-phenomenological approach to biodiversity inspired by the work of Emmanuel Levinas and his ethics of Alterity. Alterity is a unique characteristic of the other (human or non-human other) that escapes our conceptualisations, and therefore can alter our worldview, values, and attitudes. Among the multiple facets of the notion of Alterity, we focus on unknownness. We show that unknownness is an important ethical source of the value of biological diversity. We illustrate how this approach can be applied to conservation action with a case study discussion of the Tre ' zence Valley (south-west France).

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluates and compares performance of three supervised classification algorithms namely Maximum Likelihood (MXL), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using very high resolution WorldView-2 satellite imagery for vegetation type/land cover (VT/LC) mapping in Keoladeo National Park (KNP), India. We mapped 16 (8 gregarious VT and 8 LC) classes, and used Bootstrap (with 100 iterations) method for accuracy assessment. All three algorithms produced high overall accuracy (OA) (67-85%) and kappa (K) (65-83) values. Visual comparison of the predictions revealed that SVM (OA = 85.12% (K = 83.9) with 3.85% width of confidence interval) performed the best followed by ANN (69.72% (67.32) with 4.43%) and MXL (67.37% (65.22) with 4.33%). This research provides insight for selection of classification algorithm for detailed VT/LC mapping of wetland associated systems using very high resolution satellite data. The findings of this research are useful for environmental management, restoration and conservation planning of KNP, India. The database will be of high value for future development and sustainability issues in the park.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study sought to assess the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on two wetland systems (Makuleke and Nylsvley Nature Reserve) in the Limpopo Transfrontier River Basin (LTRB) in South Africa between 2014 and 2018. To fulfil this objective, multi-date Landsat images were used. Furthermore, the maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used to identify various LULC classes within delineated wetlands. The LULC changes were mapped from the two wetlands, with high overall accuracies, ranging from 80% to 89% for both study areas. The spatial extent of the Makuleke wetland declined by 2% between 2014 and 2018, whereas the Nylsvley wetland decreased by 3%. Built-up areas have increased slightly over the 2014 and 2018 period because of population growth and infrastructure development, which occupy a portion of the wetland. In Nylsvley wetland, it was evident that during the 5-year monitoring period, croplands increased steadily in the Nylsvley catchment. Overall, the results demonstrated a steady decline in natural vegetation cover in both wetlands. This information can aid in enforcing wetland legislations and LULC management practices that can help protect them from further encroachment and degradation.

T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geophysical and remote sensing datasets were employed to delineate potential zones of gold mineralization within the southern Kibi-Winneba belt of Ghana. The study area, which is characterized by the Birimian metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks with prevalence of intrusive granitoids hosts several scientifically unguided operational activities by artisanal miners locally referred to as Galamsey. In this study, various enhancement techniques were employed on geophysical datasets encompassing magnetic, gravity and radiometric to delineate various lithological units, which corroborated with the Birimian formation and its related granitoid intrusives within the study area. The Center for Exploration Targeting grid analysis and Line Module Algorithm techniques were employed respectively on the magnetic and Sentinel 2A datasets to delineate various structural lineaments within the study area. Approximately 72% and 67% structural lineaments delineated respectively from the magnetic and Sentinel 2A datasets trended in the NE-SW and N-S direction, which control gold mineralization within the Birimian system. The prinicpal component analysis based on the Crosta technique was employed on the Sentinel 2A bands to highlight alteration zones within the study area. A potential map of gold mineralization zones within the study area was generated by integrating exploration layers comprising magnetic, gravity, structural density, radiometric and alteration zones delineated by Crosta technique. This mineral potential map categorized the belt into low, moderately low, moderately high and highly prospective regions with area coverage of 600.4 km2, 681.27 km2, 635.95 km2 and 295.20 km2 respectively. The mineralization potential map obtained was validated with available gold geochemical data and locations of artisanal mining operations (Galamsey), which corroborated with the highly potential mineralization zones of gold deposits delineated within the study area.

TI  - Analytical categories to describe deficit attributions in deep disagreements between citizens and experts
T2  - PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disagreements often arise from citizen-expert collaboration, as both agents share a different epistemic worldview. Fogelin, following Wittgenstein, proposed that some disagreements (i.e. deep disagreements) cannot be rationally solved when participants share different forms of life. Citizen-expert is an exemplar of this sort of disagreement. Moreover, deep disagreements are often followed by deficit attributions from one of the agents to the other, regarding their epistemic understanding, credibility, and motives. Articulating the notions of deep disagreements and deficit attributions, as well as reviewing the complementary concept of epistemic injustice, we have constructed analytical categories that allow us to understand two things: (1) how deficit attributions operate in dialogical contexts of deep disagreements and (2) what types of deficit attributions we can find. We expect that this characterization can serve to analyze citizen-expert dialogues and the pursuit of more modest and inclusive forms of conversation.

In this study, a shallow sediment core (2.84 m long) retrieved from the Red Sea coastal zone in northern Ghubbat al Mahasin, south of Al-Lith, Saudi Arabia, is used to reconstruct the mid-Late Holocene paleoenvironments and sea level based on a multiproxy approach. Remote sensing data, sedimentary facies, benthic foraminiferal assemblages, 818O and 813C stable isotopes, elemental composition and 14C dating were utilized. The stratigraphy of the core shows three distinctive depositional units. The basal pre 6000 year BP unit consists of unfossiliferous fine to medium sand sharply overlain by black carbonaceous mud and peat, suggesting deposition in a coastal/flood plain under a warm and humid climate. The middle unit (6000-3700 year BP) records the start and end of the marine transgression in this area. It consists of gray argillaceous sand containing bivalve and gastropod shell fragments and a benthic foraminiferal assemblage attesting a lagoonal or quiet shallow marine environment. The upper unit (<3700 year BP) consists of unfossiliferous yellowish-brown argillaceous fine-grained sands deposited on an intertidal flat. Both middle-and upper-units stack in a regressive shallowing upward pattern although they may be separated by a hiatus. The overall regressive facies and the stable isotopic data are consistent with a late Holocene sea-level fall and a change to a more arid climate.

TI  - World disorder and peace research: a sociological, post-nationalist reading of the pathway to sustainable peace
T2  - CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper offers a sociological reading of the concept of world order within the peace research debate, mindful of the complexity of systemic factors that influence changing interpretations. By addressing the clash of thought currents that have seen 'traditionalist' peace researchers interpret peace as a phenomenon opposed to conflict, while 'progressive' researchers view it as a social and sustainable development capable of mitigating conflict while containing disruptive aspects, this study critically reconstructs utopian conflict theories within a complex mosaic, which leads from conflict to a new vision of a peaceful world. In this view, there is no longer room for a concept of world order as expression of an arbitrary system of dominance, but a tendency to read social reality through the lenses of the complexity theories as a worldwide disorder. Following giants such as Kenneth Boulding and Johan Galtung, this paper investigates the four interconnected pillars of the new worldview - peace, society, economy, and nature - and the role played by conflict in defining its identity. Pursuing a vision that seeks to recompose the contents of positive peace and sustainable development, the researcher will try to understand the direction taken by the new sustainability paradigms.

TI  - Precipitation events determine the spatiotemporal distribution of playa surface salinity in arid regions: evidence from satellite data fused via the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Playas are desert landscapes unique to arid regions that respond quickly to climate change. Changes in surface salinity in Praia are directly linked to water security and regional ecological and economic health. This study aimed to explore the sensitivity of remotely sensed spectral indices to precipitation events. An ESTARFM was utilized to fuse daily (less than 10% cloudiness) MODIS and Landsat 8 imagery from April to September 2019 in the Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve. Salinity was tested in the laboratory after soil collections in May (spring) and August (summer). The significantly correlated normalized difference vegetation and salinity indices were compared to the precipitation data and found to fluctuate in response to precipitation. The normalized difference vegetation and salinity indices decreased following precipitation events and increased during precipitation intervals, and the precipitation amount and evaporation intensities may have influenced the magnitudes of the decrease and increase. Following precipitation, the playa surface produces new puddles and a new spatial distribution pattern of soil salinity. This study determined that the spatiotemporal fusion technique is an effective method for observing the dynamics of playa surfaces, and precipitation and evaporation affect the spatial distribution of salt on the playa surface; however, the monitoring period should be short when utilizing remote sensing to monitor playa salinity.

TI  - Identifying and separating climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies using GRACE satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological changes, which are affected by climate variability and human activities, pose challenges to the sustainable management and conservation of water resources. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of how climate and anthropogenic activities impact land water storage. Previous studies using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data have struggled to effectively separate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on water storage. Here, we propose a statistical model that simulates natural dynamically driven changes in water storage to reconstruct climate-driven water storage anomalies at basin scales and discuss the possibility of differentiating climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies. The prediction and reconstruction performance of this method shows optimal robustness. Compared with water storage anomalies calculated using land surface models, our reconstruction results are closer to GRACE observations, especially in humid basins with few human interventions. Mismatches are found in basins with intensive human interventions. Isolated human-driven water storage anomalies in four representative basins correlate well with anthropogenic water usage in each basin. The results of this study provide a method to effectively separate and monitor climate- and human-driven water storage anomalies, thereby providing information for better protection and utilization of water resources.

TI  - An Acoustic Survey of Beaked Whales and Kogia spp. in the Mariana Archipelago Using Drifting Recorders
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution, abundance, and habitat of cryptic cetacean species such as beaked whales and dwarf/pygmy sperm whales (Kogia spp.) are challenging to study due to their long dive times and/or very limited surface behavior. Even less is known in minimally studied and remote regions, including the Mariana Archipelago and parts of the broader western Pacific. In 2018, we deployed a network of eight Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs) on the west side of the Mariana Archipelago with the goal of examining the distribution and habitat of beaked whales and Kogia spp. in this region using passive acoustic monitoring. Concurrently, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data were collected within the drift area and combined with satellite oceanographic data to build Ensemble Random Forest Models to identify specific oceanographic features that determine the distribution of these species. DASBRs deployed at locations ranging from 13 degrees N to 18 degrees N generally drifted from east to west between the Mariana Archipelago and the West Mariana Ridge. Spectral and temporal characteristics of echolocation signals were used to identify the presence of beaked whales and Kogia spp. species. This dataset contained frequency modulated (FM) pulses characteristic of Longman's (Indopacetus pacificus), Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), and Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) beaked whales, as well as the unidentified beaked whale FM pulse known as the "BWC," along with narrow-band high frequency clicks from Kogia spp. The detection rate was substantially higher for all species on the five tracks in the region north of 15.5 degrees N than for those drifts occurring farther south. Species distribution models suggest that differences in the oceanographic characteristics between the northern and southern regions may impact foraging opportunities, possibly explaining the specific ecological niche for these species within this water mass. This is the first study of the distribution of cryptic cetacean species within the wider Mariana Archipelago region. We demonstrate that autonomous drifting acoustic recorders, combined with environmental sampling and remote satellite data are a powerful tool for studying the habitat dependent distribution of cryptic cetacean species.

TI  - Soil parent material prediction through satellite multispectral analysis on a regional scale at the Western Paulista Plateau, Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Parent material is the main source for soil textural, mineralogical, and other physical attributes. The knowledge over this factor is explored generally in low scale geology maps, insufficient for most users. Remote sensing can offer assistance in this regard, since it allows the evaluation of soil properties, as largely indicated in literature, being a potential tool to delineate parent material. Thus, we explored a multi temporal Landsat image composition with bare soil reflectance to extract soil properties and distinguish discrepant lithological classes at the western plateau, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The area is 247,737 ha large, where 981 soil samples were collected at 0-20 cm depth. We acquired the synthetic soil image and linked the pixel's spectra with soil attributes. We performed a digital soil mapping procedure to generate maps of attributes related to parent material. The soil maps offered a great input on identifying the transitions between sandstone and basalt as soils from these formations have significant differences in clay, sand, Fe2O3 and TiO2 contents. Therefore, the use of remote sensing coupled with digital soil mapping is a strong alternative to conventional methods to improve low scale PM maps to enhance detail on regional and local scales.

TI  - Monitoring desertification in Mongolia based on Landsat images and Google Earth Engine from 1990 to 2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the most serious ecological and environmental problems in arid regions. Low-cost, wideranging, and high-precision methods are essential for the formulation of appropriate strategies for quantitatively monitoring desertification. In this study, based on Google Earth Engine and Landsat images, six machine learning methods were used to monitor desertification dynamics in 1990-2020 in Mongolia. The spatiotemporal distributions and changes in desertification at different stages were analyzed using gravity center change and intensity analysis models. Subsequently, we quantitatively investigated the factors driving desertification in Mongolia. The results indicate that the maximum entropy method can obtain the most accurate assessment of the degree of desertification in comparison with the other five methods, with an accuracy of 96%. In 1990-2005, the area of desertified land increased significantly, afterward, a decreasing trend was observed. Lightly and moderately desertified lands had the highest change intensities and were most sensitive to environmental factors. Although the desertification dynamics are under the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors, precipitation plays a dominant role in Mongolia. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the desertification status and trends in Mongolia, and presents desertification maps that can be used to formulate preventive measures and guide desertification prevention and control.

TI  - Using spectral indices as early warning signals of forest dieback: The case of drought-prone Pinus pinaster forests
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest dieback processes linked to drought are expected to increase due to climate warming. Remotely sensed data offer several advantages over common field monitoring methods such as the ability to observe large areas on a systematic basis and monitoring their changes, making them increasingly used to assess changes in forest health. Here we aim to use a combined approximation of fieldwork and remote sensing to explore possible links between forest dieback and land surface phenological and trend variables derived from long Landsat time series. Forest dieback was evaluated in the field over 31 plots in a Mediterranean, xeric Pinus pinaster forest. Landsat 31-year time series of three greenness (EVI, NDVI, SAVI) and two wetness spectral indices (NMDI and TCW) were derived covering the period 1990-2020. Spectral indices from time series were decomposed into trend and seasonality using a Bayesian estimator while the relationships of the phenological and trend variables among levels of damage were assessed using linear and additive mixed models. We have not found any statistical pieces of evidence of extension or shortening patterns for the length of the phenological season over the exam-ined 31-year period. Our results indicate that the dieback process was mainly related to the trend component of the spectral indices series whereas the phenological metrics were not related to forest dieback. We also found that plots with more dying or damaged trees displayed lower spectral indices trends after a severe drought event in the middle of the 1990s, which confirms the Landsat-derived spectral indices as indicators of early-warning signals. Drops in trends occurred earlier for wetness indices rather than for greenness indices which sug-gests that the former could be more appropriate for dieback detection, i.e. they could be used as early warning signals of impending loss of tree vigor.

TI  - Cross-ECV consistency at global scale: LAI and FAPAR changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A framework is proposed for assessing the physical consistency between two terrestrial Essential Climate Vari-ables (ECVs) products retrieved from Earth Observation at global scale. The methodology assessed the level of agreement between the temporal variations of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The simultaneous changes were classified according to their sign, magnitude and level of confidence, whereby the respective products uncertainties were taken into consideration. A set of pro-posed agreement metrics were used to identify temporal and spatial biases of non-coherency, non-significance, sensitivity and the overall level of agreement of the temporal changes between two ECVs. We applied the methodology using the Joint Research Center (JRC) Two-stream Inversion Package (TIP) products at 1 km, those provided by the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) based on the SPOT/VGT and Proba-V at 1 km, and the MODIS MCD15A3 at 500 m. In addition, the same analysis was applied with aggregated products at a larger scale over Southern Africa. We found that the CGLS LAI and FAPAR products lacked consistency in their spatial and temporal changes and were severely affected by trends. The MCD15A3 products were characterized by the highest number of non-coherent changes between the two ECVs but temporal inconsistencies were mainly located over the eastern hemisphere. The JRC-TIP products were highly consistent. The results showed the advantages of physically-based retrieval algorithms, in both JRC-TIP and MODIS products, and indicated also that, except for MODIS over forests, aggregated products using an uncertainty-based weighted average led to higher agreement between the ECVs changes.

TI  - Assessment of regional and temporal trends in per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances using the Oriental Magpie (Pica serica) in Korea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are used in industrial and commercial products due to their amphiphilic properties. Birds have been utilized as biomonitoring species due to their environmental pollutant vulnerability and wide distribution. The Oriental Magpie (Pica serica) is a representative residential species inhabiting terrestrial environments. In this study, we measured PFAS concentrations in Magpie liver tissue (n = 253) collected from 12 Korean regions in 2004 and 2017. The predominant compounds were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS; mean: 23.8 ng/g wet weight), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA; 2.79 ng/g), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA: 2.11 ng/g). We observed significant correlations between Magpie PFAS measurements, indicating similar sources and bioaccumulation processes. Adult females showed significantly lower PFOS concentrations than adult males and young males and females, indicating that avian sex is a crucial physiological factor of PFAS accumulation. PFOS, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) concentrations in urban regions were significantly higher than rural regions. PFOS concentrations in Magpie livers increased significantly between sampling years, whereas C11-C13 carboxylic acids (PFCAs) decreased. This suggests that urbanization and population are major factors in Magpie PFAS accumulation. Almost all hepatic PFOS concentrations were below the threshold values proposed by previous studies, implying limited risks. Our findings suggest that the Oriental Magpies are PFAS sentinel in residential environments. This is the first comprehensive report on biomonitoring of PFASs using the Oriental Magpie.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate change detection of cropland area and their spatial distributions are important for cropland monitoring, food security, and sustainable development. Tea as a strategic crop in northern Iran, has faced many challenges in the coming decades which has led to a decrease in its area under cultivation. The present study aims to identify changes in tea land area located in central district of Lahijan, Gilan, Iran by using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images. First, pre-processing stage was performed on satellite images including atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections. The supervized neural network classification method was employed, resulting in three classification maps with overall accuracies of 94.82, 95.36 and 97.84% and kappa coefficients of 96.22, 97.91, and 98.42 for 1999, 2011, and 2019, respectively which these were satisfactory. The images were categorized into four different classes, namely tea land, agriculture, forest and urban area. The results of Land Change Modeler showed that during 1999-2019, tea and agricultural lands decreased by 23.46% (2142 ha) and 41.71% (3872 ha). The loss trend of tea area in 1999-2011 has been more remarkable with a decrease of 1943 ha (21.28%). This downward trend continued with a slower slope (2.77% equal to 199 ha). Urbanization with growth rate of 381.71% consumed 2096 ha of tea land. Further, forestland contributed 251 ha to tea land losses. Reversely, the contribution of agricultural land to net change of tea area were positive so that 403 ha in 1999-2011 and 74 ha in 2011-2019 from cropland were converted to tea land. The paper highlights the advantage of digital change detection techniques for policy makers to take appropriate decision to return the situation and to conserve the productive agricultural lands.

TI  - Why do disequilibria exist? An ontological study of Kirznerian economics
T2  - CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In his influential critique of mainstream economics, Israel Kirzner rejected the notion of equilibrated economies in an attempt to develop a realistic account of the workings of entrepreneurial markets. Key to Kirznerian analysis are the arguments that (i) economies do not equilibrate because there always exist unexploited opportunities, and (ii) opportunities remain unexploited until 'entrepreneurially alert' individuals discover them. This paper draws from Tony Lawson's philosophy of economics to explain that Kirznerian economics is no more realistic than mainstream. According to Lawson, it is the ontological commitment to closed systems thinking-not superficial theoretical features such as equilibrium-that makes mainstream economics unrealistic. I argue that Kirzner's theoretical system similarly presupposes a closed system ontology. Whereas the mainstream worldview presumes the instant exploitation of opportunities, the Kirznerian worldview presumes their delayed yet unavoidable exploitation. The ontological critique of Kirznerian economics simultaneously facilitates the reorientation of entrepreneurship theory towards genuinely realistic modes of thought. This is feasible once we acknowledge the non-empirical ontology of `entrepreneurial opportunity' and concomitant fallibility of the `entrepreneurial imagination': opportunities remain unexploited because (inter alia) their existence is known only after their actualisation. The existence of economic disequilibria does not require non-actors who are blind to opportunities, and there is no mysterious force of `entrepreneurial alertness' guaranteeing their eventual exploitation and inevitable movement towards economic equilibria.

TI  - A method for quality management of vegetation phenophases derived from satellite remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has become an important technique for monitoring vegetation phenology. The quality of remote-sensing images and derived products is key to successful extraction of vegetation phenophases. There is a need to develop quality management methods to evaluate the data uncertainty and assist the removal of the noises. This paper developed a shape quality assurance score threshold (SQAT) method which accounts for the trend in satellite-derived vegetation index associated with the process of vegetation growth. The proposed method was tested on six widely used methods for extracting vegetation phenophases. Results showed that the SQAT method can effectively identify noises in the vegetation index time series and improve the accuracies of estimated start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) of the six methods. After removal of identified noises, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) averagely increased by 8% for SOS, and 11% for EOS. Regression analyses of vegetation phenophases between the PhenoCam observations and MCD12Q2 product showed that the proposed method performs better than the QA score of MCD12Q2 for quality management. This paper provides promising method for quality management; it has the potential to reduce the uncertainty of the vegetation index time series that can support studies of vegetation phenology monitoring.

AB  - What is the role of housing price risk in explaining the timing and the extent to which development sprawls at the urban fringe? Price risks create a real option, which incentivizes developers to delay development, thereby slowing down urban sprawl. We interpret satellite imageries of Toronto in 1986-2016 and match the changes in land-use/cover with residents' socioe-conomic status as well as price and risk data. We find that higher-risk areas experienced 3-5 percentage points slower growth in urban coverage in 1986-2016; if policy is to stabilize price risk, urban coverage could have increased by 7.02-9.79%.

TI  - Assessment and analysis of morphometric characteristics of Lake Tana sub-basin, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at assessing and quantitatively analysing morphometric parameters of the Lake Tana Sub-basin and its catchments using remote sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIS). The extraction of drainage network was performed from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m x 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data using the Arc Hydro extension within ArcGIS 10.2. The drainage network analysis of the sub-basin revealed that the sub-basin is a seventh order with a dendritic drainage pattern and very fine drainage texture. Further, the analysis of the study showed that the catchments Gilgel Abay, Ribb and Gumera are a fifth-order stream whereas Megech is a sixth-order stream. Values of bifurcation ratio is high that indicates the presence of a higher number of streams even in the higher orders, high structural disturbance, availability of erodible soils and occurrence of high overland flow and discharge. The drainage density also revealed the basin area is permeable, with high precipitation, infiltration rate and vegetation covers. Moreover, the elongation ratio showed the basin is elongated and low class. The smaller stream frequency indicates that the basin experienced low relief, permeable bedrock and the presence of alluvial fans and flood plains. The results of this study provide information on drainage morphometry for researchers and watershed managers to understand the watershed characteristics. It serves as a basis for improved planning, management and decision making to ensure sustainable use of the basin resources, river basin evaluation, watershed prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resources management at macro and micro level.

TI  - Potential flood hazard zonation and flood shelter suitability mapping for disaster risk mitigation in Bangladesh using geospatial technology
T2  - PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-lying Bangladesh is known as one of the most flood-prone countries in the world. During the last few decades, the frequency, intensity, and duration of floods have increased. To ensure safety and save lives when people's homes submerge because of flooding, it is urgent to relocate them to safe shelters during the flooding. In Bangladesh, the number of designated flood shelters is very less. To plan and prioritise the building of shelters, flood hazard zonation and the identification of suitable locations for shelters are vital for disaster risk mitigation. This study attempted the first and most extensive national flood inundation database and flood dynamics of Bangladesh developed between 2017 and 2020 using public domain Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and replicable methodology. Using a set of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) criteria associated with flood disasters (e.g., floods recurrence areas), elevation, land cover, landform, population density, accessibility, distance to road, and distance to settlement layers were used to identify the hazard zones and the safest locations for building flood shelters. The study assessed that 7.11% of the area was inundated by overflow water in June 2017 and 8.99% in August 2017. Similarly, in June, July, and August 2018; June, July and August 2019, and July 2020, with inundation covering 7.26%, 10.87%, 11.07%, 9.50%, 10.56%, 5.01% and 11.14% of the country, respectively. The results show that extremely-high flood prone areas cover about 13% of Bangladesh. Analysis of the suitability of flood shelters shows that about 8% is extremely-high suitable, 16% is very-high suitable, and 7% is very-low suitability for flood shelters. The flood suitability and flood hazard maps would be helpful to support the local government, national and international organisations for flood disaster risk minimisation and the planning and construction of flood shelters.

TI  - Full-coverage spatiotemporal mapping of ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> over China from Sentinel-5P and assimilated datasets: Considering the precursors and chemical compositions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) are significant indicators for monitoring the air quality relevant to living conditions. At present, most remote sensing based approaches for the estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 employed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products as the main variate. Nevertheless, the coverage of missing data is generally large in AOD products, which can cause deviations in practical applications of estimated PM2.5 and PM10 (e.g., air quality monitoring and exposure evaluation). To efficiently address this issue, our study explores a novel approach using the datasets of the precursors & chemical compositions for PM2.5 and PM10 instead of AOD products. Specifically, the daily full-coverage ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are estimated at 5-km (0.05 degrees) spatial girds across China based on Sentinel-5P and assimilated datasets (GEOS-FP). The estimation models are acquired via an advanced ensemble learning method named Light Gradient Boosting Machine in this paper. For comparison, the Deep Blue AOD product from VIIRS is adopted in a similar framework as a baseline (AOD-based). Validation results show that the ambient concentrations are well estimated through the proposed approach, with the space-based Cross-Validation R2s and RMSEs of 0.88 (0.83) and 11.549 (22.9) mu g/m3 for PM2.5 (PM10), respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves better performance than the AOD-based in different cases (e.g., overall and seasonal). Compared to the related previous works over China, the estimation accuracy of our method is also satisfactory. Regarding the mapping, the estimated results through the proposed approach display consecutive spatial distribution and can exactly express the seasonal variations of PM2.5 and PM10. The proposed approach could efficiently present daily full-coverage results at 5-km spatial grids. It has a large potential to be extended for providing global accurate ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 at multiple temporal scales (e.g., daily and annual). (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Delusion-like experiences are related to negative perceptions of self and others in non-clinical individuals
T2  - PSYCHOSIS-PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIAL AND INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Delusions are a core feature of psychosis and are thought to exist on a continuum from healthy individuals to clinical populations. This study examined the relationship between delusion-like experiences, using the Peters Delusional Inventory (PDI), and two aspects of personal worldview: core schemas (positive and negative views of the self and others) and locus of control (LOC). 258 healthy participants without a history of psychiatric illness completed an online survey assessing these constructs. Stepwise regression controlling for age and negative affect, revealed that negative self-schemas significantly predicted the presence of delusion-like experiences whilst negative schemas of others significantly predicted both the presence of delusion-like experiences and associated levels of distress and preoccupation. Positive schemas did not relate to delusions as measured by the PDI. Hierarchical regression demonstrated that LOC did not significantly predict delusion-like experiences. The findings highlight that negative schemas of others may be more critically related to delusional experiences than negative self-schemas. Replication in clinical samples is required, while some implications for future research and clinical interventions in prodromal psychosis are examined.

TI  - Eutrophication and lakes dynamic conditions control the endogenous and terrestrial POC observed by remote sensing: Modeling and application
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sources of particulate organic carbon (POC) determine its conversion, thereby playing an important role in the carbon cycle of lakes. Accurate estimation of the sources and dynamic characteristics of POC is important for understanding the migration and transformation of organic carbon. However, the synchronous observation of POC sources with large areas through remote sensing is still challenging because of the complex composition of POC and the optical conditions of inland lakes. In this study, a three-band (1/ Rrs (689)-1/ Rrs (717)) x Rrs (697)) empirical algorithm of POC sources was constructed based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) and the proportion of endogenous POC estimated from the field-measured stable isotope (delta 13CPOC) values. The validation and calibration results of the three-band algorithm showed robust performance, with MAPE and RMSE of estimated values and measured values of 10% and 0.07, respectively. The three-band algorithm had good simulation results for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) spectra. The POC sources estimated by the three-band algorithm suggest that the endogenous POC of Taihu Lake in August showed a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2019. The variation in terrestrial POC was slow and stable for both annual and monthly variations. The analysis of POC sources with total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), water temperature, and wind speed indicated that terrestrial POC was closely related to wind speed (r = 0.33, P < 0.001), while endogenous POC was significantly associated with TP (r = 0.6, P < 0.001), TN (r = 0.56, P < 0.001), and water temperature (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). The use of remote sensing algorithms to evaluate POC from different sources is convenient and effective; furthermore, it helps to better understand the carbon cycle in lacustrine ecosystems.

TI  - Assessing coastal susceptibility to sea-level rise in Alexandria, Egypt q
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of the susceptibility of Alexandria coastal zone, Egypt, to sea-level rise has been conducted. Alexandria has a vast population and vital activities (industry, fishery, and agriculture) along its coastal zones. Further reasons for such an assessment is the great historical significance of Alexandria and its lowland relief. The evaluation was implemented through examining land elevation datasets, to a sea-level rise scenario of 1 m. The materials and methods used chart the way forward to predict the hazards by integrating available different datasets using accessible analytical tools. Concerning the inundation scenario, the submergence would take place in the east and middle of Alexandria, but natural and artificial barriers would restrain the flooding to penetrate so far. While western Alexandria is relatively preserved by coastal sand dunes and ridges, and steep land slope. In the case of a tsunami hit, as has happened in later eras, there would be severe consequences, and no obstacles will be able to stop it. However, sea inundation will influence inhabitants and economy (educational facilities, Alexandria port, and railway). Therefore, an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan that includes upgrading awareness, urban growth planning, and executing regulations is recommended. Moreover, tolerable response plans and adaptation options are needed. (c) 2021 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries. Hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Indocyanine green-a potential to explore: narrative review
T2  - ANNALS OF LAPAROSCOPIC AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Laparoscopic surgery is the standard approach for treatment of early stages of gastric cancer, as there is no evidence to recommend it in more advanced cancers. The minimally invasive technique is associated with some complications, the most concerning of which is anastomotic leakage. Moreover, some aspects of this approach, like lymphadenectomy extension, are still debated. In last years, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was introduced in laparoscopic surgery to improve visualization of anatomical and pathological structures. The purpose of this review article is to delve into all the possible applications of ICG imaging in gastric cancer surgery.Background: After injection, ICG becomes fluorescent when excited either by a laser beam, or by nearinfrared light at certain wave lengths. The fluorescence released by ICG can be detected using specifically designated scopes and cameras. In the field of gastric cancer surgery, ICG can be injected intravenously, to visualize arteries and bowel perfusion, or peritumoral, to visualize the tumour and the lymph nodes.Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed and Embase database to identify relevant articles on ICG fluorescence guided surgery and laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery.Conclusions: More in detail, the paper shows the indications of ICG fluorescence angiography and its association with anastomotic leakage, if compared to standard procedure. Then, it defines the advantages of ICG use to perform the sentinel lymph node mapping, with its application in early gastric cancer. The use of ICG for lymphatic mapping to perform lymphadenectomy is a visual guide and allows to increase the number of lymph nodes harvested. Finally, experimental studies have been published on the use of ICG for and intraoperative identification of peritoneal carcinomatosis.

TI  - Variability-based constraint on ocean primary production models
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS
M3  - Letter
AB  - Primary production (PP) is fundamental to ocean biogeochemistry, but challengingly variable. Satellite models are unique tools for investigating PP, but are difficult to compare and validate because of the scale separation between in situ and remote measurements, which also are rarely coincident. Here, I argue that satellite estimates should be log-skew-normally distributed, because of this scale separation and because PP measurements are log-normally distributed. Whether they conform to this distributional shape is therefore a powerful variability-based constraint on such models. Satellite models that do follow a log-skew-normal may then also be concisely characterized by three parameters (log-mean, log-standard deviation, and log-skewness). I show that the output from a recent satellite model (CAFE) over 2019 agrees excellently with the log-skew-normal, globally and for most spatiotemporal subsets investigated here. The exception is the Northern Hemisphere winter, which may suggest future model improvements. PP by plankton is essential to ocean ecology and biogeochemistry, so satellite models that estimate PP from remote sensing data are indispensable in numerous scientific applications. However, because the corresponding in situ data are rarely measured when a satellite passes overhead, are measured on a much smaller spatial scale, and are highly variable, it is very difficult to compare different satellite models, evaluate how accurate they are, or to constrain their parameters. Here, a different approach to evaluating, comparing, and constraining these models is described, which accounts for or avoids all of these issues with the standard approach. This approach finds excellent agreement overall with a recent satellite model, while also identifying room for improvement.

TI  - City-level variations in aerosol optical properties and aerosol type identification derived from long-term MODIS/Aqua observations in the Sichuan Basin, China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the Sichuan Basin (SCB) has suffered from severe aerosol pollution. Based on the long-term (2003-2018) aerosol optical properties dataset derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), this study investigated the spatial distribution and interannual variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine-mode fraction (FMF) as well as the aerosol type at city-level in the SCB. The spatial distribution of AOD exhibited a decreasing trend from the centre of SCB to surrounding areas with high AOD approximately 1.0. The high FMF value was approximately 0.9 in surrounding southern areas. The frequency of occurrence of AOD < 0.2 was approximately 30%-40%. AOD in SCB exhibited a negative trend of approximately -0.03/year and FMF showed a significant positive trend of approximately 0.01-0.02/year. The proportion of continental background aerosols was higher in surrounding areas of SCB. The BB/UI (biomass burning/urban-industrial) aerosols in the central urban area increased significantly to approximately 50%. Mix aerosols were mainly distributed in the north, accounting for approximately 35%-45%. A large proportion of dust aerosols (30%-35%) was noted in the east SCB. The results of this study are of great scientific significance for the analysis of aerosol optical extinction at city level in the SCB of China.

TI  - Thermal remote sensing reveals communication between volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy Volcanic Group
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanoes are traditionally considered isolated with an activity that is mostly independent of the surrounding, with few eruptions only (<2%) associated with a tectonic earthquake trigger. Evidence is now increasing that volcanoes forming clusters of eruptive centers may simultaneously erupt, show unrest, or even shut-down activity. Using infrared satellite data, we detail 20 years of eruptive activity (2000-2020) at Klyuchevskoy, Bezymianny, and Tolbachik, the three active volcanoes of the Klyuchevskoy Volcanic Group (KVG), Kamchatka. We show that the neighboring volcanoes exhibit multiple and reciprocal interactions on different timescales that unravel the magmatic system's complexity below the KVG. Klyuchevskoy and Bezymianny volcanoes show correlated activity with time-predictable and quasiperiodic behaviors, respectively. This is consistent with magma accumulation and discharge dynamics at both volcanoes, typical of steady-state volcanism. However, Tolbachik volcano can interrupt this steady-state regime and modify the magma output rate of its neighbors for several years. We suggest that below the KVG the transfer of magma at crustal level is modulated by the presence of three distinct but hydraulically connected plumbing systems. Similar complex interactions may occur at other volcanic groups and must be considered to evaluate the hazard of grouped volcanoes.

TI  - Development of a predictive score of axillary lymph node dissection based on targeted axillary dissection in patients with breast cancer diagnosis, affected lymph nodes, and neoadjuvant treatment
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To determine predictive factors of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) results in breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), and subsequent staging using Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD).Material and method: Case-control study between January 2016 and August 2019. Patients with BC, cN1 staging, marked with a metallic clip prior to NACT, and subsequently staged with TAD and ALND were included. They were divided into 2 groups: ALND patients with or without metastatic involvement (group 1 and group 2, respectively). We carried out a univariate analysis comparing clinical, radiological, surgical and pathological variables, and a logistic regression, (dependent variable: positive result of ALND; independent variables: number of suspicious lymph nodes in diagnostic ultrasound, positive hormone receptors, HER2 positive, complete clinical-radiological response to NACT, positive TAD, and biopsy of <= 2 nodes in TAD). A score for prediction of a metastatic ALND was proposed, with an internal validation study.Results: 60 patients were included: Group 1: 33 (55.0%); Group 2: 27 (45.0%). Tumor size (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95%CI 1.02-2.74), number of suspected nodes in ultrasound (OR = 2.20; 95%CI 1.01-4, 77), HER2 positive (OR 0.04; 95%CI 0.003-0.54), clinical-radiological response to NACT (OR = 0.07; 95%CI 0.01-0.75), and positive TAD (OR 15.48; 95%CI 1.68-142.78) were independent predictors of a positive result in ALND. We developed a "positive ALND predictive score", with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: p = 0.65), and discrimination (AUC = 0.93; 95% CI 0, 87-0.99), with highest Youden index (0.7) at cut-off point of 17% risk of positive ALND (sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 70%).Conclusion: Tumor size, number of suspected nodes, positive HER2, response to NACT, and metastatic TAD are independent predictors of ALND. The predictive score for positive ALND would be a good indicator to safely omit ALND.

TI  - Toward the development of a weather index insurance for rice farmers in the coastal region of Myanmar
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Climate change is expected to exacerbate damage to agricultural production from natural disasters. Examination of measures to adapt to the damage represents an urgent matter for agriculture. A multidisciplinary research project aimed at providing effective information related to development a weather index insurance (WII) system was conducted for rice farmers in a coastal region of Myanmar to achieve sustainable rice farm management in the country, which is among the world's poorest and most disaster prone. For lower income countries, WII is one adaptation measure to mitigate damage by climate change. Using remote sensing and statistical data, changes in tracks of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, the duration of damage by cyclone disasters, and areas affected by saltwater intrusion were analyzed to ascertain risk levels for disasters in the target area: Labutta township in the Ayeyarwady region. Furthermore, demand analysis of WII using discrete choice experiments, a question-based statistical survey method, revealed that farmers' demand of WIIs for cyclone landfall, flood, and drought is relatively greater than that for saltwater intrusion. This finding indicates that saltwater intrusion might not be a crucially important matter for farmers who cultivate rainfed rice, whereas inland water floods caused by cyclone landfall and drought caused for changing the weather patterns represent a threat for these farmers. Results of econometric model analysis for designing a WII indicate that if a regular farmer in the township were to pay 41.5 US dollars per year to purchase WII for flood damage, their expected income will be stable.

TI  - Environmental factors modulate the diffuse fertilization effect on gross primary productivity across Chinese ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Diffuse radiation allocated by cloud cover and aerosols can promote vegetation photosynthesis, which is known as the diffuse fertilization effect (DFE). As an important uncertain factor regulating the DFE, understanding the role of environmental conditions in the response of terrestrial ecosystems to diffuse radiation is vital for quantitative and intensive studies. By using a light use efficiency model and statistical methods with satellite data and ChinaFLUX observation data, the optimal environmental range of DFE was estimated, the indirect role of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (T-a) on DFE was explored, and the relative contribution of diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR(dif)) on gross primary productivity (GPP) was analyzed across Chinese ecosystems under different sky conditions. The results showed that the DFE increased with leaf area index (LAI), but distributed a unimodal curve along with VPD and T-a, both of which had an optimum range that was lower in the forest (or cropland) and higher in the grass (or desert) ecosystem. When considering the co-effect of VPD and T-a, the strongest positive effect of DFE was found at 0-5 h Pa and 20-25 degrees C. Based on path analysis, PAR(dif) promoted GPP and served as the main controlling factor in forest ecosystems predominantly through a direct pathway from half-hourly to the daily scale, while T-a and VPD occupied the dominant position at single canopy ecosystem sites. When the aerosol optical depth (AOD) increased, the relative contribution of PARdif increased in multiple-canopy ecosystems and decreased in single-canopy ecosystems; when the sky conditions changed from sunny to cloudy, the relative contribution of PAR(dif) was higher in the forest ecosystem and increased significantly in the grass ecosystem. These findings offer a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental effects of regulating DFE on GPP across ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating the temperature vegetation dryness index and meteorology parameters to dynamically predict crop yield with fixed date intervals using an integral regression model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes integrating remote sensing and meteorological data for dynamic winter wheat yield prediction at fixed date intervals with an integral regression model. In most cases, both rainfall and irrigation supply the water needs of crops. We postulated that meteorological precipitation could not fully represent the actual amount of water available to crops, whereas the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) can represent actual water, which monitors soil moisture. According to this, meteorological and remote-sensing data based on sunshine hours, temperature, and TVDI formed a light-temperature-water data combination, which are the three most fundamental and critical factors related to crop growth. The new data combination was used as the input variables of the integral regression model, which could predict the crop yield at a fixed date interval of any length. The dynamic results were then compared with that of the meteorology data combination (sunshine hours, temperature, and precipitation). We selected a total of seven county-level areas in semi-humid and arid regions in China. The proposed dynamic prediction approach achieved good results at the county level from March 21 to maturity at 16-day intervals with predicted R2 > 0.94 and root mean squared error range of 15.54-121.01 kg ha-1 between predicted and actual yield with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for each prediction date. The trend of dynamic prediction accuracy had a relatively stable state. In addition, TVDI contained more crop water information, and prediction results using TVDI and meteorology were generally superior to that using only meteorology for semi-humid and arid areas, with the best results for arid regions. Thus, integrating meteorology and TVDI could effectively dynamically predict yield at county level for most agroclimatic regions, and particularly for arid regions. The work has implications for dynamic yield prediction and improving prediction accuracy and can be extended to other areas.

TI  - A comprehensive review of hyperspectral data fusion with lidar and sar data
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
M3  - Review
AB  - With the development of remote sensing techniques, the fusion of multimodal data, particularly hyperspectralLight Detection And Ranging (HS-LiDAR) and hyperspectral-SAR, has become an important research field in numerous application areas. Multispectral, HS, LiDAR, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images contain detailed information about the monitored surface that are complementary to each other. Thus, data fusion methods have become a promising solution to obtain high spatial resolution remote-sensing images. The main point of this review paper is to classify hyperspectral-LiDAR and hyperspectral-SAR data fusion with approaches. Moreover, recent achievements in the fusion of hyperspectral-LiDAR and hyperspectral-SAR data are highlighted in terms of faced challenges and applications. Most frequently used data fusion datasets that include IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contests are also described.

TI  - Mapping Leaf Area Index of restored mangroves using WorldView-2 imagery in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been efforts to restore and rehabilitate mangrove forests to compensate for their loss or degradation. Approaches for monitoring these efforts are increasingly developed, including assessment of the dynamic changes in restored mangroves using the biophysical tree parameter called Leaf Area Index (LAI). This study aimed to (1) apply a semi-empirical approach to estimate LAI using WorldView-2 imagery, (2) compare the LAI distributions of three different mangrove forest types (natural, mixed, and planted) at the mangrove restoration site in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, and (3) evaluate the applicability of LAI as an indicator for monitoring mangrove growth in restoration areas. To achieve these objectives, a high-spatial-resolution WorldView-2 image data (2 m pixel size) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used. A semi-empirical approach was used to correlate field LAI and NDVI values at the corresponding location. The results showed that the best regression function between the two variables was the third-order polynomial (R-2 = 0.98). Overall, the estimated LAI values ranged from 0 to 9.56 (mean = 1.87, sigma = 0.95, max. Accuracy = 97.6%) and differed between the three mangrove forest types. The comparison revealed that high LAI was associated with planted mangrove forest type where Rhizophora sp. dominated. It indicates that LAI is a useful indicator for assessing mangrove bio-physical conditions and, as such, can be used for monitoring mangrove restoration activities and outcomes.

TI  - Comparing ground and remotely sensed measurements of urban tree canopy in private residential property
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Private residential areas represent a large portion of urban tree canopy and provide a significant amount of ecosystem services for mitigation of negative environmental impacts. With densification, construction of impermeable surfaces, loss of plantable space and urban tree canopy loss, communities are facing a potential degradation of urban environment and loss of living quality. Monitoring urban tree canopy change with repeated assessments over time is key for supplying information for management decisions.We examined how remote sensing has been used in the past assessments of urban tree canopy area, the public availability and quality of geodata sources and grey literature examples. Field measurements of tree canopy area were collected in private residential properties in Malmo, Sweden and compared to estimates of canopy area using remote sensing data collected by the public mapping agency Lantmateriet. The remote sensing model was derived using normalized difference in vegetation (NDVI) and LiDAR.Most Swedish municipalities conduct urban tree monitoring schemes only on street and park trees. Our results show a correlation in remotely sensed tree canopy area and field measurements, suggesting that monitoring of private residential areas can be conducted frequently and non-invasively where remote sensing information of similar quality is available.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To define similarities and differences between neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) and hypoxic-ischemic neonatal encephalopathy (HINE). Methods A retrospective case-control study was conducted of neonates born at 35 weeks or more and weighing 1800 g or more at a tertiary care university hospital, between 2005 and 2016, with NAIS (group A), perinatal asphyxia (PA) with Stage II-III HINE (group B), and PA with or without Stage I HINE (group C). Ante- and intrapartum data, neonatal characteristics, and placental histopathology were compared. Results Eleven neonates were identified in group A, 10 in group B, and 227 in group C. Sentinel events occurred exclusively in groups B (80%) and C (41.4%). Umbilical cord blood gas values and Apgar score were worse in groups B and C compared to group A. No group A neonates required resuscitation at birth, whereas all group B and one-third of group C neonates did. Seizures developed only in neonates in groups A and B. One neonatal death occurred in group A. There were no significant differences in placental histopathology. Conclusion NAIS and PA/HINE cases have different intrapartum and neonatal features. PA does not seem necessary for the occurrence of NAIS. More research is needed regarding associated placental abnormalities.

TI  - HPC cluster-based user-defined data integration platform for deep learning in geoscience applications
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Efficient and flexible data integration platforms are important to apply various geoscience data for deep learning applications. Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied to analyze and predict natural phenomena in Earth sciences using geoscience data. Because geoscience data are considered as "big data", data driven approaches such as deep learning are promising tools for understanding natural phenomena. In this paper, we propose a Geoscience Data Integration Platform (GeoDIP) for managing big geoscience data based on High-performance Computing (HPC) cluster systems. Methodology: GeoDIP provides data pre-processing and analyzes modules according to user defined configurations when creating Artificial Intelligence (AI) ready datasets. To determine the application of GeoDIP, we demonstrated precipitation prediction performance using multiple datasets. We collected three datasets from different sources: two from satellite observations and one from reanalysis data for weather forecasting. We then compared the results obtained for each dataset and the results obtained for integrated datasets. Results: The results confirmed that the integrated dataset generated from GeoDIP provided 9% improved prediction performance for F1-score over 2 h. This suggests that various types of information on atmospheric conditions explaining precipitation genesis from multiple data sources are crucial for precipitation prediction. For understanding model performance, we conducted a permutation-based feature importance test, which confirmed that the upper level information is important over time. In addition, we evaluated the performance of GeoDIP by comparing sequential and parallel tasks and obtained a performance improvement of approximately 97%. Conclusions: The proposed geoDIP facilitates the utilization of multiple datasets to analyze geophysical phenomena using parallel processes of HPC clusters with reduced computational time for data pre-processing and analysis.

TI  - A Novel Technique for Inversion of Rotation Angles in Built-Up Areas
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In previous publications, it is generally believed that the rotated buildings in built-up areas can induce polarization orientation angles, which cause overestimation of the volume scattering contribution. However, we found that the rotation effect of the double-bounce scattering wall-ground structures cannot be accurately expressed by an orientation angle. In this letter, dihedrals are used to simulate the wall-ground structures, and a novel technique for inversion of rotation angles in built-up areas is proposed. This letter is committed to directly inverting rotation angles rather than orientation angles. Then the rotation angles are compensated into the measured scattering matrix instead of deorienting the coherence matrix. C-band GF-3 and L-band ALOS-2 polarimetric data of San Francisco are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed inversion technique.

TI  - False-negative frozen section of sentinel nodes in early breast cancer (cT1-2N0) patients
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard approach for the axillary region in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative nodes. The present study investigated patients with false-negative sentinel nodes in intraoperative frozen sections (FNSN) using real-world data. Methods A case-control study with a 1:3 ratio was conducted. FNSN was determined when sentinel nodes (SNs) were negative in frozen sections but positive for metastasis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. The control was defined as having no metastasis of SNs in both frozen and FFPE sections. Results A total of 20 FNSN cases and 60 matched controls from 333 SLNB patients were enrolled between April 1, 2005, and November 31, 2009. The demographics and intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer were similar between the FNSN and control groups. The FNSN patients had larger tumor sizes on preoperative mammography (P = 0.033) and more lymphatic tumor emboli on core biopsy (P < 0.001). Four FNSN patients had metastasis in nonrelevant SNs. Another 16 FNSN patients had benign lymphoid hyperplasia of SNs in frozen sections and metastasis in the same SNs from FFPE sections. Micrometastasis was detected in seven of 16 patients, and metastases in nonrelevant SNs were recognized in two patients. All FNSN patients underwent a second operation with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). After a median follow-up of 143 months, no FNSN patients developed breast cancer recurrence. The disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival in FNSN were not inferior to those in controls. Conclusions Patients with a larger tumor size and more lymphatic tumor emboli have a higher incidence of FNSN. However, the outcomes of FNSN patients after completing ALND were noninferior to those without SN metastasis. ALND provides a correct staging for patients with metastasis in nonsentinel axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Area-ratio Fraunhofer line depth (aFLD) method approach to estimate solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence in low spectral resolution spectra in a cool-temperate deciduous broadleaf forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emissions were estimated by the "area-ratio Fraunhofer line depth (aFLD) method", a new retrieval methodology in spectra from a low spectral resolution (SR) spectroradiometer (MS-700: full width half maximum (FWHM) of 10 nm and spectral sampling interval of 3.3 nm), assisted with a scaling to reference SIF detected from high SR spectrum. The sparse pixels of a spectrum of low SR misses detecting the minimum of the O(2)A absorption band around at 760 nm, which makes the SIF detection by conventional FLD methods lose accuracy considerably. To overcome this, the aFLD method uses the definite integral of spectra over a wide interval between 750 and 780 nm. The integration of the spectrum is insusceptible to the change in shape of the depression curve, leading to higher accuracy of the aFLD method. Daily SIF, calculated by the aFLD method using the spectra obtained with MS-700, was scaled to reference daily SIF calculated by the spectral fitting method using the spectra obtained from August to December 2019 with an ultrafine SR spectroradiometer (QE Pro, FWHM = 0.24 nm). As a result, SIF calculated from MS-700 spectra by aFLD method was strongly correlated with the reference SIF from QE Pro spectra (r(2) = 0.81) and was successfully scaled. Then, the scaled 11-year SIF from MS-700 at a deciduous broadleaf forest showed the correlation with GPP at multiple time steps: daily, monthly, and yearly, consistently during 2008-2018. The comparison of aFLD-derived SIF with the global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF data set (GOSIF) showed high correlation on monthly values during 2008-2017 (r(2) = 0.85). The combining approach of the aFLD method with a scaling to reference SIF successfully detected long-term canopy SIF emissions, which has great potential to provide essential information on ecosystem-level photosynthesis.

TI  - Toxicity of malathion during Senegalese sole, <i>Solea senegalensis</i> larval development and metamorphosis: Histopathological disorders and effects on type B esterases and CYP1A enzymatic systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The toxicity of malathion to Solea senegalensis was studied in a static renewal bioassay during its first month of larval life (between 4 and 30 dph). Through the use of different biomarkers and biochemical, cellular and molecular approaches (inhibition of cholinesterases [ChEs], changes in cytochrome P450-1A [CYP1A] and the study of histopathological alterations), the effects of three concentrations of malathion (1.56, 3.12, and 6.25 mu g/L) have been analyzed. In subacute exposure, malathion inhibited cholinesterase activities (AChE, BChE, CbE) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, ranging the inhibition percentage from 20% to 90%. However, the expression levels of CYP1A and AChE transcripts or proteins were not modified. Additionally, exposure to malathion provoked histopathological alterations in several organ systems of Senegalese sole in a time- and dose dependent way, namely disruption of parenchymal architecture in the liver, epithelial desquamation, pyknotic nuclei and steatosis in the intestine, disorganization of supporting cartilage, and sings of hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the gills and degeneration of the epithelial cells from the renal tubules. Malathion exposure also provoked strong disorganization of cardiac fibers from the heart. The findings provide evidence that exposure to sublethal concentrations of malathion that provoked serious injury to the fish S. senegalensis, were below the expected environmental concentrations reported in many other ecosystems and different fish species,revealing a higher sensitivity for Solea senegalensis to malathion exposure, thus reinforcing its use as sentinel species for environmental pollution in coastal and estuarine environments.

TI  - Trophic state in a tropical lake based on Chlorophyll-a profiler data and Sentinel-2 images: The onset of an algal bloom event
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The condition of Lake Zirahuen was evaluated before and after a significant algal bloom took place. The state of the lake was tracked using measurements of chlorophyll-a concentration from a fluorometer attached to a conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiler and complemented with the use of satellite images from Sentinel-2. It was found that the current state of the lake is in transition from an oligotrophic to a mesotrophic level with some evidence of deterioration, but still being considered as a clear lake. With the use of empirical algorithms to retrieve chlorophyll-a from satellite data it was found that the images presented an acceptable feasibility (R-2 = 0.64). The observed algal bloom was detected one month before the algae reached its major extent, being the reflectiveness of the green band a good indicator of the onset of the algal bloom event. Favorable conditions for the algal bloom were also recorded two months before its major extend through a chain of thermistors. Practitioner Points The trophic state of Lake Zirahuen was evaluated before and after a significant algal bloom took place. The lake is classified as being in transition from oligotrophic to mesotrophic. Nonetheless, it continues to have good clarity. Satellite images improve in the description of the spatial-temporal variability of the lake. In particular, the green band reflectiveness.

TI  - Smart testing and selective quarantine for the control of epidemics
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper is based on the observation that, during Covid-19 epidemic, the choice of which individuals should be tested has an important impact on the effectiveness of selective confinement measures. This decision problem is closely related to the problem of optimal sensor selection, which is a very active research subject in control engineering. The goal of this paper is to propose a policy to smartly select the individuals to be tested. The main idea is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10'000 individuals show that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine and polymorphism in <i>Plasmodium falciparum kelch13-propeller</i> gene in Equatorial Guinea
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are the currently recommended first- and second-line therapies for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infections in Equatorial Guinea. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of these artemisinin-based combinations and detect mutations in P. falciparum kelch13-propeller domain gene (Pfkelch13).Methods: A single-arm prospective study evaluating the efficacy of ASAQ and AL at three sites: Malabo, Bata and Ebebiyin was conducted between August 2017 and July 2018. Febrile children aged six months to 10 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection and other inclusion criteria were sequentially enrolled first in ASAQ and then in AL at each site, and followed up for 28 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters were assessed. The primary endpoint was PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Samples on day-0 were analysed for mutations in Pfkelch13 gene.Results: A total 264 and 226 patients were enrolled in the ASAQ and AL treatment groups, respectively. Based on per-protocol analysis, PCR-adjusted cure rates of 98.6% to 100% and 92.4% to 100% were observed in patients treated with ASAQ and AL, respectively. All study children in both treatment groups were free of parasitaemia by day-3. Of the 476 samples with interpretable results, only three samples carried non-synonymous Pfkelch13 mutations (E433D and A578S), and none of them is the known markers associated with artemisinin resistance.Conclusion: The study confirmed high efficacy of ASAQ and AL for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum infections as well as the absence of delayed parasite clearance and Pfkelch13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance. Continued monitoring of the efficacy of these artemisinin-based combinations, at least every two years, along with molecular markers associated with artemisinin and partner drug resistance is imperative to inform national malaria treatment policy and detect resistant parasites early.

TI  - Groundwater dependence of riparian woodlands and the disrupting effect of anthropogenically altered streamflow
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian ecosystems fundamentally depend on groundwater, especially in dryland regions, yet their water requirements and sources are rarely considered in water resource management decisions. Until recently, technological limitations and data gaps have hindered assessment of groundwater influences on riparian ecosystem health at the spatial and temporal scales relevant to policy and management. Here, we analyze Sentinel-2-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; n = 5,335,472 observations), field-based groundwater elevation (n = 32,051 observations), and streamflow alteration data for riparian woodland communities (n = 22,153 polygons) over a 5-y period (2015 to 2020) across California. We find that riparian woodlands exhibit a stress response to deeper groundwater, as evidenced by concurrent declines in greenness represented by NDVI. Furthermore, we find greater seasonal coupling of canopy greenness to groundwater for vegetation along streams with natural flow regimes in comparison with anthropogenically altered streams, particularly in the most water-limited regions. These patterns suggest that many riparian woodlands in California are subsidized by water management practices. Riparian woodland communities rely on naturally variable groundwater and streamflow components to sustain key ecological processes, such as recruitment and succession. Altered flow regimes, which stabilize streamflow throughout the year and artificially enhance water supplies to riparian vegetation in the dry season, disrupt the seasonal cycles of abiotic drivers to which these Mediterranean forests are adapted. Consequently, our analysis suggests that many riparian ecosystems have become reliant on anthropogenically altered flow regimes, making them more vulnerable and less resilient to rapid hydrologic change, potentially leading to future riparian forest loss across increasingly stressed dryland regions.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Data Over Urban Areas Considering Geometry Effect: Method and Application
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) over urban areas is of great significance for urban thermal environment monitoring. In previous studies, most of the urban LST retrieval methods were developed based on the assumption of a flat surface without considering the influence of urban 3-D geometry structure, which has a significant impact on the retrieval accuracy of LST over urban areas. In this study, a radiative transfer equation (RTE)-based single-channel method was developed to retrieve LST with urban geometry effect correction from the Landsat 8 thermal infrared (TIR) data in band 10. The increase in adjacent radiance from the surrounding pixels and the decrease in atmospheric downwelling radiance caused by urban geometry structure were taken into account in this method. Because it is difficult to directly validate the retrieval accuracy of LST over urban areas using in situ LST measurements, the performance of the RTE-based LST retrieval method was evaluated via comparing brightness temperature (BT) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) simulated by the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model and the urban RTE over three subregions. There is a good agreement between BT at the TOA simulated by the DART model and the urban RTE, with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of less than 0.25 K. The variations in LST retrieved with urban geometry effect correction over different local climate zones (LCZs) were analyzed. In general, built-up LCZs have relatively higher LST than land cover LCZs. The differences between LST retrieved without/with urban geometry effect correction over different LCZs are greater than 0.2 K. The largest average LST difference over built-up LCZs is approximately 0.9 K, whereas that over land cover LCZs is approximately 0.65 K. LST retrieved without/with urban geometry effect correction was used to calculate urban heat island intensity (UHII) in terms of the LCZ-based method. The results indicate that UHII calculated from LST with urban geometry effect correction is lower than that calculated from LST without urban geometry effect correction, with an average difference of approximately 0.5 K.

TI  - Ocean satellite data assimilation using the implicit equal-weights variational particle smoother
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The implicit equal-weights variational particle smoother (IEWVPS) is a combination of the particle filter (PF) and weak-constraint 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) method, that inherits the merits of both. The IEWVPS avoids the filter degeneracy of particle filters through an implicit equal-weights scheme and reduces the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) by introducing the 4D-Var method. This method has been tested using the Lorenz 96 model in a previous study, and we now implement it in the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS), which is a realistic and complex ocean model. Two key problems, the representation of the analysis error covariance and the choice of the parameter were solved during this implementation. With an eddy-permitting model, satellite-based sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) observations were assimilated with a set of 40 particles IEWVPS scheme. Compared with the ensemble 4D-Var method, the IEWVPS can reduce the bias introduced by perturbed atmospheric forcing, effectively improving temperature simulations in the upper 50 m while maintaining the RMSD of SSH at the same level. Therefore, the cooling effect caused by typhoons in the upper ocean is better characterized under the IEWVPS scheme than with previously used method. The ratio of RMSD to the ensemble spread indicates that the ensemble quality of the IEWVPS is much better than that of the ensemble 4D-Var. In addition, the computational cost of the IEWVPS is only slightly larger than that of the ensemble 4D-Var. One additional tangent linear model integration, one additional nonlinear model integration, and perturbation fields inputs/outputs are still needed.

TI  - Simple Method to Extract Lake Ice Condition From Landsat Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice plays key roles in regulating hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical, and socioeconomic functions of lakes. Long-term in situ lake ice phenological records indicate that lake ice is trending toward later freeze-up, earlier breakup, and a shorter ice duration. Parallel to study of lake ice using in situ records and process-based models, satellite remote sensing can expand our understanding of lake ice change over large spatial scales. However, most remote sensing studies have focused on large lakes or short periods of time, which may not robustly represent changes over multidecadal time periods or in the much more numerous small lakes. Here, we present a random forest model, Sensitive Lake Ice Detection (SLIDE), to accurately extract ice conditions from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images. We trained the model using a manually labeled lake ice dataset (1089 labeled areas over 995 lakes globally). Our results show that our model achieves accurate classification between ice/snow and water (accuracy: 97.8%, kappa coefficient: 95.5%). Comparing Landsat-derived ice cover with in situ ice conditions, we show that our model produces less bias, lower RMSE, and higher kappa than does the Landsat snow/ice flag from the quality assessment band. This is especially true during the transitional period surrounding the ice on and off dates reported from in situ (mean bias -7.3% from our model, -17.3% from the Landsat quality band). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of mining the rich Landsat archive to study lake ice dynamics and of better flagging ice-affected lake observations.

TI  - Analysing patterns of forest cover change and related land uses in the Tano-Offin forest reserve in Ghana: Implications for forest policy and land management
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change is a major contributing factor to global environmental change. Whereas several studies have focused on the general land use and land cover dynamics, we focus on analysing forest cover change patterns in a protected landscape taking into consideration how other land categories are increasing at the expense of the forest. In this study, we analyse forest cover change patterns and associated proximate land use factors between 1987 and 2017 using Landsat images from the Tano-Offin Forest Reserve (TOFR) in Ghana. Using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm, we classified the images into forest, developed land, and agricultural land. The study finds that forest cover losses are 1.9 and 1.4 times the amount of forest cover gains in 1987-2002 and 2002-2017, respectively. We find that even though the forest cover is more likely to recover from the agricultural land, land developers mostly targeted the agricultural land. The focus of Ghana's Forest and Wildlife Policy and the underlying process of forest cover change in the TOFR suggest that a country's forest policy should focus on a combination of diverse and spatially explicit proximate factors that are likely to threaten the integrity of forests.

TI  - Is satellite Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence more indicative than vegetation indices under drought condition?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts represent one of the most severe abiotic stress factors that could result in great crop yield loss. Numer-ous vegetation indices have been proposed for monitoring the vegetation condition under stress and assessing drought impacts on yield loss. However, the understanding and comparison between traditional vegetation indi-ces (VIs) and the newly emerging satellite Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) for monitoring vegetation condition is still limited especially under drought stress and at multiple spatial scales. In this study, the potential of satellite observation SIF for monitoring corn response to drought was investigated based on the 2012 drought in the US Corn Belt. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was used here to quantify drought. We found that all SPEI were above -1, except for July (-1.27), August (-1.39) and September (-1.14) in 2012, indicating the severity of this drought. We examined the relationship between satellite mea-surements of SIF, SIFyield, VIs (e.g., NDVI and EVI) and SPEI. Results indicated that SIFyield was sensitive to drought and SIF captured the stress more accurately both at the regional and state scales for the US Corn Belt. Quantita-tively, SIFyield had a high correlation with SPEI (r = 0.987, p < 0.05) over the entire Corn Belt, and it indicated losses in response to drought approximately one month earlier than SIF/NDVI/EVI. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that SIF could be trusted as an effective indicator to study the relationship between GPP (R-2 >= 0.8664, p < 0.01) under drought conditions across the Corn Belt. This study highlighted the advantage of using satellite SIF observations to monitor the drought stress on crop growth especially GPP at regional scale. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rainforests play an important role in the global ecosystem. However, significant regions of them are facing deforestation and degradation due to several reasons. Diverse government and private initiatives were created to monitor and alert for deforestation increases from remote sensing images, using different ways to deal with the notable amount of generated data. Citizen Science projects can also be used to reach the same goal. Citizen Science consists of scientific research involving nonprofessional volunteers for analyzing, collecting data, and using their computational resources to outcome advancements in science and to increase the public's understanding of problems in specific knowledge areas such as astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. In this sense, this work presents a Citizen Science project called ForestEyes, which uses volunteer's answers through the analysis and classification of remote sensing images to monitor deforestation regions in rainforests. To evaluate the quality of those answers, different campaigns/workflows were launched using remote sensing images from Brazilian Legal Amazon and their results were compared to an official groundtruth from the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project PRODES. In this work, the first two workflows that enclose the State of Rondonia in the years 2013 and 2016 received more than 35,000 answers from 383 volunteers in the 2,050 created tasks in only two and a half weeks after their launch. For the other four workflows, even enclosing the same area (Rondonia) and different setups (e.g., image segmentation method, image spatial resolution, and detection target), they received 51,035 volunteers' answers gathered from 281 volunteers in 3,358 tasks. In the performed experiments, it was possible to observe that the volunteers achieved satisfactory overall accuracy, higher than 75%, in the classification of forestation and non-forestation areas using the ForestEyes project. Furthermore, considering an efficient segmentation and a better image spatial resolution, they achieved almost 66% accuracy in the classification of recent deforestation, which is a great challenge to overcome. Therefore, these results show that Citizen Science might be a powerful tool in monitoring deforestation regions in rainforests as well as in obtaining high-quality labeled data.

T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE INVESTIGATIVE OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To examine the clinicopathologic factors that contribute to regional and distant recurrence in intermediate to high risk head and neck melanoma patients after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Methods This study is a retrospective review from an academic tertiary care center. Patients treated with SLNB for head and neck melanoma from 1997 to 2019 were reviewed and characterized by sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. Clinical variables were examined for the impact on regional and distant recurrence in SLNB-negative patients using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Results One hundred and fifty four patients were included. Of note, 127 (82.5 %) were men, and the average age was 61.3 years. Median follow-up was 68.6 weeks. Pathologic review of SLNs found 3.9% positive for metastatic melanoma; 96.1% were negative. Regional recurrence was significantly associated with tumor stage and age on multivariate analysis. A total of 4.5% of patients recurred in a previously labeled negative basin. Scalp subsite accounted for 30.5% of primary tumors and was more likely to yield a positive SLN on univariate analysis (P = .023). Tumor stage and age were significantly associated with distant metastasis on multivariable analysis (P = .026, P < .001 respectively). Conclusion We report a number of prognostic trends in head and neck melanoma. SLN positivity was found more often in patients with a primary tumor of the scalp. Regional recurrence was significantly associated with age and tumor stage, whereas distant recurrence was significantly associated with tumor staging and scalp subsite. Scalp subsite was associated with an increased risk for nodal metastasis and distant recurrence. Level of evidence 3.

T2  - HEADACHE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives/Background: Expand the differential diagnosis of sentinel headache to include spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) and reinforce the need for lumbar puncture in the evaluation of thunderclap headache. SSEH is a rare clinical presentation especially in the absence of bleeding tendencies. Clinicians recognize SSEH with typical presenting signs and symptoms including regional paraspinal muscular contraction and pain along with myelopathy. Although thunderclap headache usually does not connote vascular rupture in the spinal epidural compartment, SSEH may rarely present with sentinel headache and later evolve into a myelopathy.Results and Conclusion: Sentinel headache may be the sole symptom following spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhage preceding both myelopathic and meningeal signs and symptoms. SSEH can best be diagnosed by lumbar puncture at this early moment potentially averting spinal cord injury.

TI  - Heterologous expression of bacterial cytochrome P450 from Microbacterium keratanolyticum ZY and its application in dichloromethane dechlorination*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dichloromethane (DCM) is a volatile halogenated hydrocarbon with teratogenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. Biodegradation is generally regarded as an effective and economical approach of pollutant disposal. In this study, a novel strain was isolated and its cytochrome P450 was heterologously expressed for DCM degradation. The isolate, Microbacterium keratanolyticum ZY, was characterized as a Gram-positive, rod-shaped and flagella-existed bacterium without spores (GenBank No. SUB8814364; CCTCC M 2019953). After successive whole-genome sequencing, assembly and annotation, eight identified functional genes (encoding cytochrome P450, monooxygenase, dehalogenase and hydrolase) were successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant strain expressing cytochrome P450 presented the highest degradation efficiency (90.6%). Moreover, the specific activity of the recombinant cytochrome P450 was more than 1.2 times that of the recombinant dehalogenase (from Methylobacterium rhodesianum H13) under their optimum conditions. The kinetics of DCM degradation by recombinant cytochrome P450 was well fitted with the Haldane model and the value of maximum specific degradation rate was determined to be 0.7 s-1. The DCM degradation might occur through successive hydroxylation, dehydrohalogenation, dechlorination and oxidation to generate gemhalohydrin, formyl chloride, formaldehyde and formic acid. The study helps to comprehensively understand the DCM dechlorination process under the actions of bacterial functional enzymes (cytochrome P450 and dehalogenase).

TI  - A comparative study of machine learning and Fuzzy-AHP technique to groundwater potential mapping in the data-scarce region
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater prospecting with reasonable accuracy is often a challenging task. The integration of geographic information system (GIS) with Machine Learning techniques has proven very reliable to delineate the nonlinear behaviour of groundwater occurrence. The weighted overlay analysis is one of the many essential tools used for groundwater potential zonation, based on remote sensing technology and has been extensively used in the several research work. However, the performance of these methods have not been evaluated for the data-scarce regions. The fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) has been used to assign weights to the most used hydrological conditioning parameters to calculate groundwater potential index. Support vector classifier, knearest neighbors and random forest classifier have been used as machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the groundwater potential. The models have been trained, tested and deployed based on 208 yield data of wells. All the affecting parameters have been developed using remotely sensed data. The results have been compared based on precision, recall, f1-score and Cohen's kappa score. As only 208 well data was available for 16997 Km2 of the study area, it has been observed that ML models failed to delineate the groundwater potential zones compared to fuzzy-AHP based weighted overlay analysis. Data augmentation has been used to generate the well data with distributed independent variables, which eventually increased the number of datasets and improved the performance of ML model significantly.

AB  - Building detection is a critically important task in the field of remote sensing and it is conducive to urban construction planning, disaster survey, shantytown modification, and emergency landing, it etc. However, few studies have focused on the task of the clustered building detection which is inescapable and challenging for some relatively low space resolution images. The appearance structures of those buildings are not clear enough for the single-building detection. Whereas, it has been found that the distributions of clustered buildings are mostly dense and cellular, while the backgrounds are not. This clue will be beneficial to the clustered building detection. Motivated by the fact above and other similar density estimation applications, this work mainly focuses on the information mining mechanism of dense and cellular structure. Firstly, we propose a concept of Clustered Building Detection (CBD), which contributes to develop clustered building detection techniques of remote sensing images. Secondly, a saliency estimation algorithm is proposed to mine the prior information for the clustered buildings. Thirdly and most notably, combining with the CBD and the density saliency map, a Population Capacity Estimation (PCE) method is presented. The PCE can be easily used to estimate the population carrying capacity of certain areas and future applied for national land resource management. Moreover, a Clustered Building Detection Dataset (CBDD) from Gaofen-2 satellite is annotated and contributed for the public research. The experimental results by the representative detection algorithms manifest the effectiveness for the clustered building detection. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evolution of Ecosystem Service Value and Ecological Storage Estimation in Huainan Coal Mining Area
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the long-term mining activation and use of coal, ecological environment of mining area has been damaged to a certain extent. As one of the 13 large coal bases in China, Huainan coal mining area was selected to evaluate the ecosystem service value and ecological storage value. Remote sensing images of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 based on Landsat series in Huainan mining area were employed to obtain the classification information of the surface. Referring to the existing research results, ecological service value was computed. By using a mining area ecological storage model, estimation of ecological storage were studied. Results showed that ecological service value and ecological storage both showed a downward trend. Finally, the paper put forward the comprehensive treatment countermeasures and remediation strategy of ecological environment.

TI  - TMEM106B modifies TDP-43 pathology in human ALS brain and cell-based models of TDP-43 proteinopathy
T2  - ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) inclusions (FTLD-TDP) share the neuropathological hallmark of aggregates of TDP-43. However, factors governing the severity and regional distribution of TDP-43 pathology, which may account for the divergent clinical presentations of ALS and FTLD-TDP, are not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of genotypes at TMEM106B, a locus associated with risk for FTLD-TDP, and hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72, a known genetic cause for both ALS and FTLD-TDP, on global TDP-43 pathology and regional distribution of TDP-43 pathology in 899 postmortem cases from a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. We found that, among the 110 ALS cases, minor (C)-allele homozygotes at the TMEM106B locus sentinel SNP rs1990622 had more TDP-43 pathology globally, as well as in select brain regions. C9orf72 expansions similarly associated with greater TDP-43 pathology in ALS. However, adjusting for C9orf72 expansion status did not affect the relationship between TMEM106B genotype and TDP-43 pathology. To elucidate the direction of causality for this association, we directly manipulated TMEM106B levels in an inducible cell system that expresses mislocalized TDP-43 protein. We found that partial knockdown of TMEM106B, to levels similar to what would be expected in rs1990622 C allele carriers, led to development of more TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates, which were more insoluble, in this system. Taken together, our results support a causal role for TMEM106B in modifying the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy.

TI  - Intraoperative pathology consultation during urological surgery: Impact on final margin status and pitfalls of frozen section diagnosis
T2  - PATHOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite recent improvements in diagnostic and surgical techniques in urological oncology, positive resection margin remains a significant concern for surgeons. Meanwhile, intraoperative pathology consultation with frozen section assessment (FSA), particularly for histological diagnosis of the lesions incidentally found or enlarged or sentinel lymph nodes, generally provides critical information which enables immediate decision making for optimal patient care. The intraoperative evaluation of surgical margins is also often requested, although there are some differences in its application between institutions and surgeons. Importantly, it remains to be determined whether intraoperative FSA indeed contributes to reducing the risk of final positive margins and thereby improving long-term patient outcomes. This review summarizes available data indicating the potential impact of FSA at the surgical margins during urological surgeries, including radical or partial cystectomy, partial nephrectomy, radical prostatectomy, penectomy, and orchiectomy. The accuracy and pitfalls of the intraoperative consultation/FSA diagnosis are also discussed.

TI  - Air pollution in Vietnam during the COVID-19 social isolation, evidence of reduction in human activities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease) pandemic has been spreading globally and social isolation has been implemented as an effective solution to limit the spread of the pandemic before vaccines are developed successfully. The reduction of human activities during social isolation is leading to an improvement in air quality being observed worldwide. In this study, we analysed satellite TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) NO2 products obtained from Sentinel-5P and Aura satellites, respectively, during the social isolation from 1 April 2020 to 22 April 2020 in Vietnam where air pollution is a serious environmental issue. Both TROPOMI and OMI NO2 have shown low agreement with local on-ground NO2 concentration (the correlation coefficient r equals 0.4 and 0.3 in 2020, respectively) but have had moderate correlation with each other in 2020 (r equals 0.81 for two annual averaged maps). In addition, the moderate available data ratio over cloudy northern areas were observed, especially for TROPOMI datasets. During social isolation, the national average NO2 decreased by 9.3% for TROPOMI and 7.2% for OMI, respectively, in comparison with the same periods in the previous years. The reduction was stronger in the North than in the South and lasted for one more month after the lockdown period. The decrease of NO2 density during the lockdown was observed strongly in urban areas associated with dense population, traffic density, and industrial zones. Further analysis of NO2 density for Ho Chi Minh city revealed a decreasing trend of NO2 during social isolation (16.62% and 11.77% compared with the previous month and the same period in 2019, respectively). Furthermore, we used a random forest model to estimate the NO2 density (normal life situations) based on daily meteorological data at station. During social isolation, NO2 density observed in Ho Chi Minh city decreased by 26% down to that of normal life situations. The NO2 reduction has shown strong anthropogenic impact on air pollution over the study area. Besides, the first use of TROPOMI and OMI NO2 products together has highlighted potentials of satellite observation for air quality monitoring and analysis in Vietnam where on-ground measurements are very limited.

TI  - Meteorological Satellite Operation Prediction Using a BiLSTM Deep Learning Model
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current satellite management system mainly relies on manual work. If small faults cannot be found in time, it may cause systematic fault problems and then affect the accuracy of satellite data and the service quality of meteorological satellite. If the operation trend of satellite will be predicted, the fault can be avoided. However, the satellite system is complex, and the telemetry signal is unstable, nonlinear, and time-related. It is difficult to predict through a certain model. Based on these, this paper proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep leaning model to predict the operation trend of meteorological satellite. In the method, the layer number of the model is designed to be two, and the prediction results, which are forecasted by LSTM network as the future trend data and historical data, are both taken as the input of BiLSTM model. The dataset for the research is generated and transmitted from Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), which is the load of FY4A meteorological satellite. In order to demonstrate the superiority of the BiLSTM prediction model, it is compared with LSTM based on the same dataset in the experiment. The result shows that the BiLSTM method reports a state-of-the-art performance on satellite telemetry data.

TI  - Modelling urban heat island (UHI) and thermal field variation and their relationship with land use indices over Delhi and Mumbai metro cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the World Urbanization Prospects of United Nations, the global urban population has increased rapidly over past few decades, reaching about 55% in 2018, which is projected to reach 68% by 2050. Due to gradual increase in the urban population and impervious surfaces, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has increased manifold in the cities of developing countries, causing a decline in thermal comfort. Therefore, this study was designed to model the spatio-temporal pattern of UHI and its relationships with the land use indices of Delhi and Mumbai metro cities from 1991 to 2018. Landsat datasets were used to generate the land surface temperature (LST) using mono window algorithm and land use indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference bareness index (NDBal), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). Additionally, the urban hotspots (UHS) were identified and then the thermal comfort was modelled using the UTFVI. The results showed that maximum (30.25-38.99 degrees C in Delhi and 42.10-45.75 degrees C in Mumbai) and minimum (17.70-23.86 degrees C in Delhi and 19.06-25.05 degrees C in Mumbai) LST witnessed steady growth in Delhi and Mumbai from 1991 to 2018. The LST gap decreases and the UHI zones are being established in both cities. Furthermore, the UHS and worst-category UTFVI areas increased in both cities. This research can be useful in designing urban green-space planning strategies for mitigating the UHI effects and thermal comfort in cities of developing countries.

TI  - Biological and Psychosocial Factors, Risk Behaviors, and Perinatal Asphyxia in a University Hospital: Matched Case-Control Study, Cali, Colombia (2012-2014)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Perinatal asphyxia is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in newborns. It generates high costs, both social and economic, and presents modifiable risk factors. Objective: To determine the biological and psychosocial factors and risk behaviors associated with the development of perinatal asphyxia (Sarnat II-III) in newborns from low socioeconomic status in a tier III university hospital in the city of Cali, Colombia. Materials and Methods: With a case and control design, 216 patients were studied (54 cases/162 controls) (1 case/3 matched controls). The cases were defined as newborns with modified or severe perinatal asphyxia (Sarnat II-III) between 2012 and 2014, with gestational age >= 36 weeks, with neurological signs not attributable to other causes, multiorgan compromise, advanced reanimation, and presence of a sentinel event. For the analysis, conditional logistic regression models were developed to evaluate association (OR), considering that the cases and controls had been paired by the birth and gestational age variables. Results: The final model showed that, from the group of biological variables, meconium amniotic fluid was identified as a risk factor (OR 15.28, 95%CI 2.78-83.94). Induction of labor lowered the risk of perinatal asphyxia by 97% (OR 0.03, 95%CI 0.01-0.21), and monitoring of fetal heart rate was associated with lower odds by 99% (OR 0.01, 95%CI 0.00-0.31) of developing perinatal asphyxia in the newborn. Regarding social variables, the lack of social support was identified as a risk factor for the development of perinatal asphyxia (OR 6.44, 95%CI 1.16-35.66); in contrast, secondary education lowered the odds of developing perinatal asphyxia by 85% when compared with pregnant women who only had primary school education (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.03-0.77). Conclusion: Assessment of biological and psychosocial factors and social support is important in pregnant women to determine the risk of developing perinatal asphyxia in a low-income population.

TI  - Determining effective water depth for total suspended solids (TSS) mapping using PlanetScope imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technology has increased the possibility to produce a spatially explicit estimation of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). However, factual information regarding the effective depth of waters where TSS can be effectively mapped using remote sensing data is rare. This information is essential to determine the effective depth of TSS mapping and the effect of the water column on the representativeness of the estimation results. This study aimed to (1) determine the effective water depths of TSS mapping using PlanetScope imagery, (2) map the spatial distribution of TSS at every effective depth using PlanetScope imagery, and (3) analyse the spatial distribution of the mapped TSS based on the best empirical modelling for every effective depth. PlanetScope image offered new opportunities in high spatial resolution remote sensing with daily revisit time. Four single bands of PlanetScope images (blue, green, red, and near-infrared) - corrected to the Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance, 12 band ratios, and four Principal Component bands (PC-band) were inputted to the determination process of the effective water depths. Empirical modelling between the in-situ TSS at each effective water depth andures what was the issue, wasnt able to o PlanetScope pixels at the corresponding locations was conducted. However, only image bands that exceeded the significance limit (r) were used for modelling using linear, exponential, logarithmic, second-order polynomial, or power regressions. The results showed that the band ratios of PlanetScope images could record TSS up to the effective depth of 1.8 m. The best empirical modelling in each effective depth of waters was the band ratio which is dominated by the contribution of the blue bands (B1), red (B3), and NIR (B4). B4/B3 bands combination produced TSS information at the effective depths of 0-0.2 and 0-0.4 m, B3/B4 bands at 0-0.6 and 0-0.8 m, B1/B4 bands at 0-1 and 0-1.2 m, and B1/B3 bands at 0-1.4, 0-1.61, and 0-1.8 m. For all effective depths, the spatial distribution pattern of TSS in the study site (Menjer Lake, Central Java, Indonesia) showed that high concentrations evenly spread along the edge and became increasingly lower to the centre of the lake. Meanwhile, the vertical distribution showed that the deeper the cumulative water depth, the higher the TSS.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of LUCC on NPP and its influencing factors in the Yangtze River basin, China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LUCC) will directly affect the types, structures and functions of ecosystems, and then have important impact on vegetation net primary productivity (NPP). The evaluation of the spatio-temporal dynamic changes of LUCC and regional NPP, and assessing the impact of LUCC on NPP can facilitate the corresponding management of different environmental types of regions and provide scientific guidance for scientific development of ecological resources, and better restore and control the ecological environment, thus promoting rapid economic development. Using MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and meteorological data from 2001 to 2018, combined with Carnegie-Ames-Stanford model (CASA), the regional NPP was estimated, and the influence of LUCC on NPP in Yangtze River basin from 2001 to 2018 and its causes were analyzed. The results showed that the area with a land cover and land use change account for 10.98% of the total study area in the past 18 years, and the most important change is the transformation from grassland to forest and grassland to crop/natural vegetation mosaic (NVM). Forests, wetlands, crop/natural vegetation mosaic, low vegetation cover (LVC) land, urban, and water bodies are growing. The forest land area increased the most and that of grassland decreased the most. Total NPP has increased by 53887.51GgC in the past 18 years, which was due to the combination effect of LUCC change and climate change.

TI  - Investigation of the landslides in Beylikduzu-Esenyurt Districts of Istanbul from InSAR and GNSS observations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to detect recent landslide displacements caused by geological structure of the region where there is intense urbanization using advanced Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques and with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) observations in the Beylikduzu and Esenyurt districts in Istanbul megacity, Turkey. In this study, multiple satellites with different frequencies (C-band, L-band) and periodic GNSS observations were employed. For the entire peninsula, we processed 149 images from the ascending orbit, 144 images from the descending orbit of Sentinel-1 (C-Band) and 24 ALOS-2 (L-band) images from the ascending orbit. The evaluations were carried out in the period between 2015 and 2020 for Sentinel-1 imagery and 2015-2020 for ALOS-2 imagery respectively. Since the study area is covered by dense settlements, the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI) technique was utilized to determine the landslide behaviors. According to the results, for both orbits of the Sentinel-1, the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement were observed in the range of - 10 to 6 mm. Compared to the magnitude of displacement signal measured by Sentinel-1, ALOS-2 data has higher values due to the high surface penetration of the L-band. The results showed that most of the old landslide regions are reactivated. Horizontal movement derived through Sentinel-1 showed that the highest movement overlaps with old landslides. L-band ALOS-2 provided better spatial coverage of landslide movement than C-band Sentinel-1 data, especially at the rural part along the coast of the lake.

TI  - Neck Dissections Based on Sentinel Lymph Node Navigation Versus Elective Neck Dissections in Early Oral Cancers: A Randomized, Multicenter, and Noninferiority Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE This study aimed to compare patients with early oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) (tumor category [T] 1-2, node-negative, and no distant metastasis) treated with traditional elective neck dissection (ND) with those managed by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using survival and neck function and complications as end points. METHODS Sixteen institutions in Japan participated in the study (trial registration number: UMIN000006510). Patients of age >= 18 years with histologically confirmed, previously untreated OCSCC (Union for International Cancer Control TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors 7th edition T1-2, node-negative no distant metastasis), with >= 4 mm (T1) depth of invasion, were randomly assigned to undergo standard selective ND (ND group; n = 137) or SLNB-navigated ND (SLNB group; n = 134). The primary end point was the 3-year overall survival rate, with a 12% noninferiority margin; secondary end points included postoperative neck functionality and complications and 3-year disease-free survival. Sentinel lymph nodes underwent intraoperative multislice frozen section analyses for the diagnosis. Patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes underwent either one-stage or second-look ND. RESULTS Pathologic metastasis-positive nodes were observed in 24.8% (34 of 137) and 33.6% (46 of 134) of patients in the ND and SLNB groups, respectively (P = .190). The 3-year overall survival in the SLNB group (87.9%; lower limit of one-sided 95% CI, 82.4) was noninferior to that in the ND group (86.6%; lower limit 95% CI, 80.9; P for noninferiority < .001). The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 78.7% (lower limit 95% CI, 72.1) and 81.3% (75.0) in the SLNB and ND groups, respectively (P for noninferiority < .001). The scores of neck functionality in the SLNB group were significantly better than those in the ND group. CONCLUSION SLNB-navigated ND may replace elective ND without a survival disadvantage and reduce postoperative neck disability in patients with early-stage OCSCC.

TI  - Watershed prioritization for soil erosion mapping in the Lesser Himalayan Indian basin using PCA and WSA methods in conjunction with morphometric parameters and GIS-based approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds in the subtropical Himalayan basins are highly prone to land degradation due to deforestation, landslides, intensive agriculture, population pressure and overgrazing, in particular, where various fluvial and denudation processes occur. It is important to assess the magnitude of problem and to understand the erosion process under normal conditions, so that effective measures can be implemented. Therefore, the study selected Kalsa watershed from the Lesser Himalayan region, where soil erosion is more prominent. Regarding this issue, to identify the hot spot of soil erosion of the basin, watershed prioritization methods using advanced geographical information system and remote sensing techniques integrated with weighted sum analysis (WSA) and principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, a comparison has been made to evaluate the performance of these models. The study considered sixteen different morphometric parameters, including linear (rho coefficient, stream frequency, drainage density, length of overland flow, drainage texture and constant of channel maintenance); landscape (relative relief, relief ratio, basin slope and ruggedness number); and shape (elongation ratio, form factor, circulatory ratio and compactness coefficient). Both the methods PCA and WSA indicate the same results showing high priority, meaning the outlet watersheds have high priority. The sub-watersheds in the north-eastern part have the lowest priority. The results also show that the length overland flow, relative relief, basin relief ratio and hypsometric integral are the most important indicators. The sub-watersheds prioritize high ranks, medium ranks and low ranks out of 10 sub-watersheds covering about 45.32%, 27.78% and 26.90% area of the Kalsa River watershed, respectively. This study will help regional planners, farmers and governments take more detailed decisions to propose efficient soil erosion control measures and conservation priorities of the watershed. The study findings have implications for sustainable land management and conservation goal targets (target 2.3 and 2.4; target 3.9; target 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3; target 15.3 and 15.4), which finally helps to achieve the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

TI  - Foraging behavior and body temperature of heritage vs. commercial beef cows in relation to desert ambient heat
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied foraging patterns of Raramuri Criollo (heritage breed, "RC") and Angus x Hereford (commercial beef breed, "AH") cows in relation to ambient heat and body temperature during summer (2016 and 2017) and winter (2017 and 2018) in the Chihuahuan Desert. Cows of each breed grazed separately in two adjacent pastures (similar to 1100 ha) in a crossover design for four weeks in each season/year. Animals were fitted with temperature loggers attached to blank CIDRs (Controlled Internal Drug Release device) devoid of hormones that recorded body temperature (BodyT), and GPS collars that recorded position and ambient temperature (CollarT). All sensor data were logged at 10 min intervals. A landscape thermal map (LandT) was developed from Landsat satellite imagery for habitat analysis using GPS locations chosen by individual collared cows, and air temperature (AirT) was recorded by a nearby weather station. Data were analyzed within four daytime segments: dawn (sunrise - 9AM); pre-noon (9AM - noon); post-noon (noon - 3PM); and dusk (3PM - sunset). ANOVA was used to determine whether BodyT, CollarT, LandT selection, or animal movement variables within each of the four daily segments differed (P < 0.05) for RC vs. AH cows. BodyT and CollarT increased as day progressed in both seasons. During summer, RC had lower BodyT and higher CollarT than AH (P < 0.05) during the hottest hours of the day. Increasing AirT throughout the day was associated with selection of cooler LandT in RC but not AH during summer. In winter, both breeds selected warmer landscape locations as the day progressed. Compared to AH, RC cows traveled farther, at higher velocities, and spent more time grazing and traveling and less time resting, with largest breed differences observed during the hottest hours of summer days. These results suggest that Raramuri Criollo cows exhibited higher thermotolerance than did AH. Elevated ambient summer temperatures in the Chihuahuan Desert appear to impose fewer constraints on heritage RC movement patterns compared to mainstream commercial AH cows.

TI  - Assessing vegetation condition across topography in Nainital district, India using temperature vegetation dryness index model
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability induced changes in rainfall and temperature have degraded the health of vegetation across the world. Thus, monitoring of vegetation condition is essential for maintaining ecosystem health, climate sustainability and biodiversity. This article examines vegetation condition in Nainital district located in Kumaon foothills in India during 1991-2019. We utilized satellite data-based temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) model for assessing vegetation condition. Surface moisture index and bare soil index were used for validating TVDI. Findings revealed an increasing trend in land surface temperature and decreasing trend in surface moisture content. It was also found that area under bare soil has increased considerably indicating decrease in vegetation cover. Marked variations in vegetation condition were observed during the study period due to varied topography, direction and gradient of slope and variation in rainfall. TVDI has proved to be effective tool for assessing vegetation condition. Future studies in different geographical regions may find this assessment approach useful.

TI  - Multiple-trait genomic prediction of harvest and fillet traits in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer, Bloch 1790)
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth performance and fillet yield are considered economically important traits in Asian seabass farming. However, measurement of fillet traits is difficult, expensive and not possible on the selection candidates. The aim of this study was to assess the utilization of multi-trait genomic selection to improve breeding value prediction accuracy for these traits. A total of 1047 fish were genotyped for 29,521 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Pedigree based on eleven microsatellite loci was available. Phenotypic data at harvest, including body weight (BW), standard length (SL), fillet weight (FW) and fillet yield (FY) were used in the analysis. Traditional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) and genomic BLUP (GBLUP) were implemented via single-and two-trait models to predict estimated breeding values (EBV) and genomic (G)EBV. Prediction accuracies and bias were evaluated using five-fold cross-validation with five replications. Compared to BLUP, GBLUP increased the prediction accuracies by 25% for BW, SL, FW and 10% for FY. Within GBLUP, multi-trait prediction performed slightly better than single-trait analysis. Based on the standard errors and bias, GEBV predictions were more accurate for BW, SL and FW than for FY. Prediction accuracy for FY was substantially improved with inclusion of other correlated body size traits in the validation set, and ranged from 5 to 76% relative to multi-trait GBLUP. This strategy provided an alternative to improve fillet yield in Asian seabass.

TI  - Combined use of ICG and technetium does not improve sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer: Results of the COMBITEC study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. There is scarce evidence available about the benefit of combining technetium (Tc-99(m)) and indocyanine green (ICG) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the overall and bilateral pelvic detection rates of SLNs in two retrospective cohorts: ICG exdusive vs. combined ICG+ Tc-99(m).Methods. The COMBITEC study (COMBined ICG and Technetium for SLN detection in Endometrial Cancer) consisted of a multicentre retrospective study (February 2015 June 2020) including patients diagnosed with endometrial atypical hyperplasia or early-stage endometrial carcinoma who underwent SLN biopsy by cervical injection of ICG with or without Tc-99(m) in four different referral centers in Spain.Results. A total of 180 patients were included, 51% (n = 92) in ICG group and 49% (n 88) in ICG+Tc-99(m) group. Eighty-seven percent of the patients presented endometrioid histology, and over 99% of the procedures were performed by a minimally invasive approach. Both groups were comparable regarding their basal characteristics, except for a higher body mass index in ICG+Tc-99(m) group and a bigger proportion of robotic-assisted procedures in ICG group.Overall detection rate was 92.8% without significant differences between groups (ICG: 94.6% vs ICG+Tc-99(m): 90.9%, p = .34). No significant differences were observed neither in bilateral pelvic nor aortic mapping rate. When Tc-99(m) was used, surgical procedures were significantly longer. In 7.3% of mapped patients, at least one positive SLN was found (ICG: 10.3% vs ICG+Tc-99(m): 3.9%, p = .109). Empty node packet rates and number of SLNs retrieved per patient were also similar between cohorts.Conclusion. Combining preoperative Tc-99(m) to intraoperative ICG did not improve SLN detection in endometrial cancer, but resulted in longer procedures. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - PROSAIL and empirical model to evaluate spatio-temporal heterogeneity of canopy chlorophyll content in subtropical forest
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) is the most important biophysical parameter in a forest eco-system, since it determines plant production, stress, and photosynthetic capability. Plant adaptation monitoring in a changing environment necessitates analyzing long-term changes in CCC. Present study computes CCC using the PROSAIL Radiative Transfer Model Inversion (RTM) with Artificial Neural Networking (ANN). The data from the Sentinel 2A satellite was utilized for this purpose. The various vegetation indices (VIs) were derived from Landsat and Sentinel data. The Infrared Percentage vegetation index (IPVI) from Landsat 8 demonstrated a strong connection with CC (R-2 = 0.8). Green vegetation index (GVI), Normalized difference index (NDI), and Pigment specific simple ratio index (PSSRa) exhibited good correlations with CCC. From 1997 to 2017, the correlation of IPVI with CCC was utilized to model the spatio-temporal variation of CCC. The negative trend and decrease of CCC was detected at a rate of - 1.2 g cm(-2) year(-1) throughout this 20-year period with 33% fall in chlorophyll concentration, indicating a substantial reduction in forest health. The primary differences observed in dense forest area CCC and change in agricultural CCC were minor. This dramatic drop in chlorophyll concentration creates a variety of photosynthetic vulnerabilities in the forest ecosystem, resulting in forest degradation that may have unintended consequences for humans and wildlife.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The risk of contralateral lymph node metastases following unilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in patients with vulvar cancer(s) remains to be systematically assessed.Material and methods We performed a multicenter, retrospective registry-based study of 476 patients with vulvar cancer. The primary outcome measure was the rate of contralateral non-SLN metastases in the case of positive unilateral SLN.Results Out of 476 patients with primary vulvar cancer, 202 received SLN biopsy: 58 unilateral and 144 bilateral. Out of 66 patients with unilateral metastatic SLN, 62 (93.9%) received contralateral lymphadenectomy-18 after unilateral and 44 after bilateral SLN biopsy. In the study group, 132 SLN were assessed with a median number of 2 (range 1-4) per patient and 76 of these were positive. Lymph node-positivity was associated with advanced tumor stage, as well as lymph and vascular space invasion. In the group of patients with bilateral inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy, 1004 lymph nodes were resected with a median number of 15 (range 10-29) per patient. After full dissection of the inguino-femoral lymph nodes, no contralateral non-SLN metastases were found.Conclusions The risk of contralateral non-SLN metastases in patients with unilateral SLN metastases was low. Therefore, the impact of contralateral lymphadenectomy on patient survival should be investigated in further studies.

TI  - Assessment of different kernel-driven models for daytime urban thermal radiation directionality simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Parametric kernel-driven models are crucial for operationally adjusting satellite-derived urban land surface temperatures (LSTs) obtained at slant angles to hemispherically-representative values. Various parametric models have been proposed to simulate urban thermal radiation directionality, but a comprehensive comparison of the performances of the published parametric models, especially over a variety of urban surfaces under different solar radiation conditions, remains lacking. It is also unknown whether the combination of the available hotspot and base shape kernels can be used to derive new parametric models with even better performances compared with existing models. Based on both forward-modelling and satellite datasets, here we systematically evaluate three single-kernel and eight dual-kernel parametric models. The main findings are as follows: (1) Amongst the three single-kernel models, the VIN model has the best overall performance, with an average rootmean-square error (RMSE) of 0.79 and 1.35 K, based on forward-modelling and satellite data, respectively. However, the ROU and RL models outperform the VIN model when the solar zenith angle is less than 30 degrees, and in particular it has a higher accuracy for hotspot description. (2) The dual-kernel models usually perform better than the single-kernel models. Amongst the eight dual-kernel models, those with the hotspot kernel KHotspot_rou (used by the ROU model) are more competent than those using KHotspot_vin (obtained from the Vinnikov model) as the hotspot kernel. The RVI model, in general, has the highest accuracy, with average RMSEs of 0.49 and 0.77 K based on forward-modelling and satellite data, respectively. (3) Compared with the single- and dual-kernel models, the multi-kernel models sometimes have better accuracies but the performance improvements are relatively limited. We also provide recommendations for model selection under various scenarios. Our systematic assessment improves our understanding of urban thermal radiation directionality regimes and potentially enables the improved correction of remotely-sensed urban LSTs, thus helping to advance thermal remote sensing of the urban environment.

TI  - Cervical re-injection of indocyanine green to improve sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the role of cervical re-injection of indocyanine green (ICG) to increase the detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) who underwent robotic-assisted sur-gical staging. Methods. We retrospectively identified consecutive EC patients undergoing robotic-assisted staging with SLN biopsy at our Institution between June 2016 and April 2020. Patients were excluded if they had open abdominal surgical approach, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and advanced stage [International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III-IV] at diagnosis. According to our SLN protocol, in case of either unilateral or no SLN detection, we performed an ipsilateral or bilateral cervical re-injection of ICG. Results. In total, 251 patients meeting inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. At first injection, bilateral detection was achieved in 184 (73.3%), unilateral detection in 57 (22.7%), and no detection in 10 (4.0%) patients. Cervical re-injection was performed in 51 of 67 patients with failed bilateral mapping. After cer-vical re-injection, bilateral detection rate increased to 94.5% (222/235), while unilateral and no detection were 5.1% (12/235) and 0.4% (1/235), respectively. Conclusions. Our results suggest that cervical re-injection of ICG, in case of failed bilateral mapping of SLN, brings about a significant improvement in SLN detection rates, therefore reducing the number of side-specific re-quired lymphadenectomies.

TI  - Seismotectonic analysis of the 2017 moiyabana earthquake (M<sub>w</sub> 6.5; Botswana), insights from field investigations, aftershock and InSAR studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The April 3, 2017 M-w 6.5, Moiyabana (Botswana) earthquake occurred in the continental interior of the Nubian plate and in a seismogenic region previously considered as stable. Our objective is to combine several approaches (field and remote sensing investigations) in order to adopt a multidisciplinary strategy so as to enhance our understanding of earthquake occurrence in intraplate southern Africa. We analyse the mainshock and aftershocks sequence based on a local seismic network and local seismotectonic characteristics. The earthquake rupture geometry is constrained with more than 900 aftershocks recorded over a period of three months and from the InSAR analysis of Sentinel-1 images (ascending orbit). The mainshock (25.134 E, 22.565 5; depth 22 +/- 3 km) was followed by more than 500 events of magnitude M >= 0.8 recorded in April 2017 including the largest aftershock (M-w 4.6 on the April 5, 2017). Focal mechanism solutions of the mainshock and aftershocks display predominance of NW-SE trending and NE dipping normal faulting. Stress inversion of the focal mechanisms produced results that are compatible with a NE-SW extension under normal faulting regime. The InSAR study shows fringes (a pair of ascending images 2017-03-30 and 2017-04-11) with two lobes with 3.86 cm-5.15 cm coseismic slip on a NW-SE elongated and 40-km-long surface deformation consistent with the mainshock location and normal faulting mechanism. The modelling of surface deformation provides the earthquake rupture dimension at depth with similar to 50 cm maximum slip on a fault plane striking 315 degrees, dipping 45 degrees, -80 degrees rake and with M-o 3.68 x 10(18)( )Nm. Although the seismic strain rate is of low level, the occurrence of the 2017 Moiyabana earthquake, followed by an aftershock sequence in the central Limpopo Mobile Belt classifies the intraplate region as an active plate interior.

Due to altered anatomy and fibrosis caused by initial treatments, surgeons face challenges during salvage ND. A combination of Technetium-99 m and indocyanine green (ICG) previously used in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for oral cavity cancers, may be useful in different types of neck surgeries. We aimed to show the additional advantage of this combination in detecting HNSCC and thyroid cancer recurrences, as well as individual lymphatic drainage in elective ND. Methods We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients, underwent neck surgery guided with ICG and Tc-99 m, in Hacettepe University Hospital between June 2018 and December 2020. In a total of 28 patients, intraoperative gamma probes were paired with near infrared (NIR) cameras. Patients are divided into two groups: neck surgery with recurrent occult lesion localization (NS- ROLL) (n: 14) and ND with SLN screening (ND-SLNS) (n: 14). Results Among all 14 patients in NS-ROLL group, recurrent diseases, hidden behind tissues were 100% successfully localized. In ND-SLNS group, 238 lymph nodes were harvested, metastasis rate was 31.3% (10/32) in sentinel nodes. SLNS revealed 100% accuracy in detecting metastasis in clinically N0 neck (10/238). Contralateral lymphatic drainage was observed in three patients (lateral-sided oral cavity SCC). In two patients (floor of mouth), three sentinel nodes were detected by NIR only. Conclusion The use of ICG-radiotracer provides additional value in disease removal for both primary and recurrent tumors of the head and neck.

TI  - Influence of a target's inclination on LiDAR waveform and its application
T2  - IET OPTOELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inclination is one of the important parameters of a target's surface, which is closely related to the waveform of light detection and ranging. When the target is tilted, the laser spot on the target's surface changes greatly, and the influence of the target on the echo signal is more complex. Here, the formation process of a laser's echo signal is explored. On that basis, the spot distribution model in the case of a large incident angle is optimised, and a comparison is made with the conventional method. A simulation system which can produce and display the signal affected by the inclined target is designed. In view of the difficulty in extracting the target's inclination from the echo signal, a method based on waveform analysis is proposed in this article. Then a calculation model is built to retrieve the inclination of the target from the echo signal by data fitting. The maximum measured error is only 0.948 degrees, and the maximum root-mean-squared-error is only 0.45 degrees.

TI  - Multi-temporal land use/land cover change detection and urban watershed degradation in Olorunda Local Government Area, Osun State, Nigeria
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, land use/land cover change has become a critical issue in areas where population-driven urbanization portends a serious threat to urban watersheds particularly in fast-growing cities of developing countries. The emerging urban land use change enhances the degradation process of the urban watershed environment that may result in devastating environmental challenges. This study therefore assesses multi-temporal land use/land cover change detection and the underlying drivers of rapid urban land use change in relation to the watershed environment. Data used include Landsat TM 1986, ETM + 2002 and (OLI/TIRS) 2018, SRTM elevation data, and structured questionnaire. The imageries were processed and classified using the supervised image classification technique. Change detection analysis was further carried out using the post-classification comparison technique. DEM was extracted from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data using the ArchHydro extension package of ArcGIS. A normalized difference water index was performed to unfold the surface water availability in the study area. Responses obtained from the questionnaire administration were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 package. The study revealed a 1.1% rate of deforestation per annum, a monumental change in built-up area covered at the rate of 13.2% per year and a remarkable decrease of 78.1% in the area covered by water body over a period of 32 years. It was found that factors of residential land development contributed immensely to the emerging urban land use changes that have impacted the hydrological processes. A conscious watershed conservation policy implementation is required to ensuring water security and preventing flood disasters in cities of developing countries.

TI  - An improved sea ice detection algorithm using MODIS: application as a new European sea ice extent indicator
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The continued loss of sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere due to global warming poses a threat to biota and human activities, evidencing the necessity of efficient sea ice monitoring tools. Aiming at the creation of an improved sea ice extent indicator covering the European regional seas, the new IceMap500 algorithm has been developed to classify sea ice and water at a resolution of 500m at nadir. IceMap500 features a classification strategy built upon previous MODIS sea ice extent algorithms and a new method to reclassify areas affected by resolution-breaking features inherited from the MODIS cloud mask. This approach results in an enlargement of mapped area, a reduction of potential error sources and a better delineation of the sea ice edge, while still systematically achieving accuracies above 90 %, as obtained by manual validation. Swath maps have been aggregated at a monthly scale to obtain sea ice extent with a method that is sensitive to spatio-temporal variations in the sea ice cover and that can be used as an additional error filter. The resulting dataset, covering the months of maximum and minimum sea ice extent (i.e. March and September) over 2 decades (from 2000 to 2019), demonstrates the algorithm's applicability as a monitoring tool and as an indicator, illustrating the sea ice decline at a regional scale. The European sea regions located in the Arctic, NE Atlantic and Barents seas display clear negative trends in both March (-27.98 +/- 6.01 x 10(3) km(2) yr(-1)) and September (-16.47 +/- 5.66 x 10(3) km(2) yr(-1)). Such trends indicate that the sea ice cover is shrinking at a rate of similar to 9% and similar to 13% per decade, respectively, even though the sea ice extent loss is comparatively similar to 70% greater in March.

TI  - Flood Mapping Using Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Images: A Case Study-Inaouene Watershed from Northeast of Morocco
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disasters like floods are happening worldwide. Due to their negative impact on different social, economic and environmental aspects need to monitor and map these phenomena have increased. In fact, to access the zones affected by the flood, we use open source remote sensing (RS) images acquired by optical and radar sensors. Furthermore, we present a method using Sentinel-1 images; we suggest applying Ground Range Detected (GRD) images. For this purpose, pre-processed built and provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), preserved by free software Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) for data extraction around appropriate demand. Moreover, the principal objective of this article is to assess the capability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in order to visualize flood areas in the Inaouene watershed located in north-eastern of Morocco. The origin of this natural hazard is the combination of natural and anthropogenic factors that makes the watershed vulnerable with a sub-annual frequency. The results of this work help decision-makers and managers in the field of natural risk management and land-use planning to implement a strategy and action plan for the protection of the populations and the environment against the negative impact of floods.

TI  - Phenology as accuracy metrics for vegetation index forecasting over Tunisian forest and cereal cover types
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different studies on predicting future green cover changes exist with various success levels. Each one focuses on a different story about which model is more appropriate. Therefore, finding a suitable model remains a difficult task due to the remotely sensed data issues and the complexity of the vegetation cover change process. Despite the unicity of vegetation indices time series, the forecasting assessment relies basically on the commonly used forecast error measurements (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE), Root MSE (RMSE), and the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE), etc.) which may not reflect the real potential of the fitted forecasting model. Herein, the experimentation of forecasting vegetation indices employing two univariate time series models and new accuracy metrics is discussed. Box Jenkins models (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model) and neural network model (nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model) are applied individually and coupled (NAR-NAR and NAR-ARIMA) based on a multi-resolution analysis-wavelet transform. These models' forecasting ability is evaluated using 16-days Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data of two different vegetation cover types of northwestern area in Tunisia. The major finding highlights firstly the importance of integration of the decomposition step to show off the hidden components of vegetation indices. The commonly used accuracy measures show that the coupled neural networks model outperforms other models. Then, interesting conclusions were drawn when phenological metrics are used as performance measures. Herein, Box Jenkins forecasting model generates a better NDVI curve shape than hybrid models despite their low RMSE measures. This is mainly due to good estimation of some phenological events, namely, the amplitude, the peak and the season's length. Generally, Box Jenkin model excels at handling quick variations. By contrast, combined models show better phenological metrics' estimation when the observations are complex or describe long time periods. Based on these findings, we suggest that the choice of the evaluation metric must be related to the future forecaster interest.

TI  - A spectral index for the detection of algal blooms using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery: a case study of Hulun Lake, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes at a global level have increasingly experienced algal blooms in recent decades, and it has become a key challenge facing the aquatic ecological environment. Remote sensing technology is considered an effective means of algal bloom detection. This study proposed a novel algal bloom detection index (ABDI) based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The ABDI was evaluated by application to Hulun Lake, China. Areas of algal bloom detected by the ABDI were consistent with those identified from visual interpretation maps [the coefficient of determination = 0.87; root-mean-square error = 0.67 km(2); overall accuracy >98%; Kappa coefficient >0.88]. The ABDI was less sensitive to thin cloud and turbid water compared to the floating algae index (FAI), adjusted floating algae index (AFAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Algal bloom dynamics in relation to meteorological factors in Hulun Lake were analysed using time-series MSI data, which indicated that algal blooms occurred mainly in summer and were distributed in the near-shore waters. Temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, and wind speed as well as human activities were found to influence spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms. The results indicate that ABDI is applicable to the detection of algal blooms under a variety of environmental conditions occurring in other regions, such as in the Taihu, Dianchi, and Chaohu lakes and the Yellow Sea. The results of this study can provide an operational algorithm for the detection of algal blooms and environmental management.

TI  - A 1-km hourly air-temperature model for 13 northeastern US states using remotely sensed and ground-based measurements
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate and precise estimates of ambient air temperatures that can capture fine-scale within-day variability are necessary for studies of air temperature and health.Method: We developed statistical models to predict temperature at each hour in each cell of a 927-m square grid across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States from 2003 to 2019, across similar to 4000 meteorological stations from the Integrated Mesonet, using inputs such as elevation, an inverse-distance-weighted interpolation of temperature, and satellite-based vegetation and land surface temperature. We used a rigorous spatial crossvalidation scheme and spatially weighted the errors to estimate how well model predictions would generalize to new cell-days. We assess the within-county association of temperature and social vulnerability in a heat wave as an example application.Results: We found that a model based on the XGBoost machine-learning algorithm was fast and accurate, obtaining weighted root mean square errors (RMSEs) around 1.6 K, compared to standard deviations around 11.0 K. We found similar accuracy when validating our model on an external dataset from Weather Underground. Assessing predictions from the North American Land Data Assimilation System-2 (NLDAS-2), another hourly model, in the same way, we found it was much less accurate, with RMSEs around 2.5 K. This is likely due to the NLDAS-2 model's coarser spatial resolution, and the dynamic variability of temperature within its grid cells. Finally, we demonstrated the health relevance of our model by showing that our temperature estimates were associated with social vulnerability across the region during a heat wave, whereas the NLDAS-2 showed a much weaker association.Conclusion: Our high spatiotemporal resolution air temperature model provides a strong contribution for future health studies in this region.

TI  - The color of water: The contributions of green and blue water to agricultural productivity in the Western Brazilian Amazon
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and global climate change are predicted to affect precipitation and agricultural productivity in the Amazon. Anecdotal evidence suggests that farmers are already being affected by changes in the timing and amount of precipitation, but there is little quantitative evidence on the mechanism by which precipitation affects production. This paper uses an innovative application of remote sensing and meteorological data to separate rainfall into green water (soil moisture that contributes to plant water use) and blue water (surface water), to estimate the impact of these water sources on the production and production efficiency of dairy in a mature colonization zone of the Brazilian Amazon. This approach allows us to draw inferences about different pathways through the precipitation-production causal chain and to link changes in precipitation with impacts on farm profits and welfare. We find that production and production efficiency are affected by green and blue water and that reductions in rainfall will have negative impacts that may disproportionally impact the poor. Our methods and results are informative to economists interested in this relatively new application of remote sensing data, to geographers interested in identifying the role of green and blue water in agricultural production, and more generally to researchers interested in the impacts of rainfall and water availability on small-scale producers in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Scenario simulation of land use and land cover change in mining area
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we selected 11 townships with severe ground subsidence located in Weishan County as the study area. Based on the interpretation data of Landsat images, the Binary logistic regression model was used to explore the relationship between land use and land cover (LULC) change and the related 7 driving factors at a resolution of 60 m. Using the CLUE-S model, combined with Markov model, the simulation of LULC under three scenarios-namely, natural development scenario, ecological protection scenario and farmland protection scenario-were explored. Firstly, using LULC map in 2005 as input data, we predicted the land use spatial distribution pattern in 2016. By comparing the actual LULC map in 2016 with the simulated map in 2016, the prediction accuracy was evaluated based on the Kappa index. Then, after validation, the spatial distribution pattern of LULC in 2025 under the three scenarios was simulated. The results showed the following: (1) The driving factors had satisfactory explanatory power for LULC changes. The Kappa index was 0.82, which indicated good simulation accuracy of the CLUE-S model. (2) Under the three scenarios, the area of other agricultural land and water body showed an increasing trend; while the area of farmland, urban and rural construction land, subsided land with water accumulation, and tidal wetland showed a decreasing trend, and the area of urban and rural construction land and tidal wetland decreased the fastest. (3) Under the ecological protection scenario, the farmland decreased faster than the other two scenarios, and most of the farmland was converted to ecological land such as garden land and water body. Under the farmland protection scenario, the area of tidal wetland decreased the fastest, followed by urban and rural construction land. We anticipate that our study results will provide useful information for decision-makers and planners to take appropriate land management measures in the mining area.

TI  - The Three Indices Three Dimensions (3I3D) algorithm: a new method for forest disturbance mapping and area estimation based on optical remotely sensed imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although estimating forest disturbance area is essential in the context of carbon cycle assessments and for strategic forest planning projects, official statistics are currently not available in several countries. Remotely sensed data are an efficient source of auxiliary information for meeting these needs, and multiple algorithms are commonly used worldwide for this purpose. However, both more accurate maps and precise area estimates are strongly required, especially in Mediterranean ecosystems, and scientific research in this topic area is anything but concluded.In this study, we present the new Three Indices Three Dimensions (3I3D) algorithm for the automated prediction of forest disturbances using statistical analyses of Sentinel-2 data. We tested 3I3D in Tuscany, Italy, for the year 2016, and we compared the results to those obtained using the Global Forest Change Map (GFC), LandTrendr (LT), and the Two Thresholds Method (TTM). The 3I3D map was the most accurate (omissions = 27%, commissions = 30%) followed by TTM (omissions = 35%, commissions = 39%), LT (omissions = 41%, commissions = 43%) and lastly GFC with slightly fewer omissions than LT (39%) but with many more commissions (69%). We also presented a probability sampling framework to estimate the forest harvested area using a model-assisted estimator that can be used at an operational level to produce large-scale statistics. 3I3D and TTM produced the smallest standard errors of the area estimates (8%) followed by LT (13%) and GFC (17%).

TI  - Benchmarked RADARSAT-2, SENTINEL-1 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission Change-Detection Monitoring at North Slide, Thompson River Valley, British Columbia: ensuring a Landslide-Resilient National Railway Network
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research note, we demonstrate the applicability of interferometric analyses (InSAR) of RADARSAT 2 (RS2), SENTINEL 1 (S1) and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) datasets to characterize and monitor landslides along a high-risk section of the national railway transportation corridor traversing the Thompson River valley, British Columbia. As a geomorphically active landform, the North Slide is an ideal case study for field-testing and evaluating slope change-detection monitoring incorporating satellite, aerial and ground-based geospatial technologies. RS2, S1 and RCM InSAR datasets provide valuable baseline spatial and temporal information on movement of the landslide near critical railway infrastructure when benchmarked with real-time kinematic (RTK) global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements, uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, bathymetric soundings, and ground observations. We demonstrate that monitoring unstable slopes and infrastructure at risk with multiple high spatial- and temporal-resolution satellite SAR platforms is a cost-effective natural hazard management practice that also provides important geoscience information to help develop appropriate mitigation and climate adaptation measures.

TI  - Cloudy-sky land surface temperature from VIIRS and MODIS satellite data using a surface energy balance-based method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) has been effectively retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite measurements under clear-sky conditions. However, TIR satellite data are often severely contaminated by clouds, which cause spatiotemporal discontinuities and low retrieval accuracy in the LST products. Several solutions have been proposed to fill the "gaps"; however, a majority of these possess constraints. For example, fusion methods with microwave data suffer from coarse spatial resolution and diverse land cover types while spatial-temporal interpolation methods neglect cloudy cooling effects. We developed a novel method to estimate cloudy-sky LST from polar-orbiting satellite data based on the surface energy balance (SEB) principle. First, the hypothetical clear-sky LST of missing or likely cloud-contaminated pixels was reconstructed by assimilating high-quality satellite retrievals into a time-evolving model built from reanalysis data using a Kalman filter data assimilation algorithm. Second, clear-sky LST was hypothetically corrected by accounting for cloud cooling based on SEB theory. The proposed method was applied to Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and further validated using ground measurements of fourteen sites from SURFRAD, BSRN, and AmeriFlux in 2013. VIIRS LST recovered from cloud gaps exhibited a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.54 K, a bias of -0.36 K, R-2 of 0.94, and sample size (N) of 2411, comparable to the accuracy of clear-sky LST products and cloudy-sky LST estimation from MODIS (RMSE of 3.69 K, bias of -0.45 K, R-2 of 0.93, and N of 2398). Thus, the proposed method performs well across different sensors, seasons, and land cover types. The abnormal retrieval values caused by cloud contamination were also corrected in the proposed method. The overall accuracy was better than the downscaled cloudy-sky LST retrieved from passive microwave (PMW) observations and former SEB-based cloudy-sky LST estimation methods. Validation using time-series measurements showed that the all-sky LST time series, including both clear- and cloudy-sky retrievals, can capture realistic variability without sudden abruptions or discontinuities. RMSE values for the all-sky LST varied from 2.54 to 4.15 K at the fourteen sites. Spatially continuous LST maps over the Contiguous United States were compared with corresponding maps from PMW data in the winter and summer of 2018, exhibiting similar spatial patterns but with additional spatial details. Moreover, sensitivity analysis suggested that the reconstruction of clear-sky LST dominantly impacts the accuracy of cloudy-sky LST estimation. The proposed method can be potentially implemented in similar satellite sensors for global real-time production.

TI  - Longitudinal Stability of Work-Family Enrichment and its Association With Well-Being and Personality Traits
T2  - COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Are higher levels of work-family enrichment a consequence or manifestation of certain personality traits and individuals' psychological functioning? Using random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we examined the hypothesized stability of work-to-family enrichment (WFE) and family-to-work enrichment (FWE) over two 10-year intervals, and the extent to which the within-person changes of WFE and FWE are associated with personality traits, psychological well-being, and possible gender differences. In this 20-year, longitudinal data analysis of employed adults (N = 535), results indicated the robust nature of the stability of WFE and FWE. Our results suggest that personality traits are not associated with within-person change for either WFE or FWE, but psychological well-being is associated with within-person change. Theoretically and conceptually, our findings provide strong evidence that work-family enrichment is not simply an "optimistic worldview" created by personality and well-being. The within-person results lend strong evidence that interventions that improve psychological well-being will also enhance work-family enrichment.

TI  - Fog-low stratus (FLS) regimes on Corsica with wind and PBLH as key drivers
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The French Mediterranean island of Corsica is already today confronted with a clear tendency towards water shortage, leading not only to socio-economical, but also to ecological problems. A potential, but not very widespread source of water is the presence of near-ground clouds, mostly fog. In this study, we investigate foglow stratus (FLS) frequencies in Corsica, derived from a data set of Meteosat Second Generation SEVIRI, whereby a distinction between fog and low stratus is hardly feasible using remote sensing data. The FLS frequency was studied with respect to its interaction with distinct locally-generated wind and its dependence on the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) obtained by ERA5 reanalysis (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF). Results show that radiation FLS is formed in coastal areas at sunrise, with low PBLH. On the other hand, in the interior of the island at sunset, a maximum of advection FLS is formed, fostered by locally-generated and related transport of moisture. On the east side of the island, FLS frequency is lower throughout the year due to frequent lee situations. This situation is reinforced by reduced synoptic moisture transport by westerly winds, so that westerly exposed slopes benefit from moisture input by FLS formation.

TI  - Modeling the metabolic profile of <i>Mytilus edulis</i> reveals molecular signatures linked to gonadal development, sex and environmental site
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of anthropogenic chemicals in the aquatic environment including their potential effects on aquatic organisms, is important for protecting life under water, a key sustainable development goal. In parallel with monitoring the concentrations of chemicals of concern, sentinel species are often used to investigate the biological effects of contaminants. Among these, bivalve molluscs such as mussels are filter-feeding and sessile, hence an excellent model system for measuring localized pollution. This study investigates the relationship between the metabolic state of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and its physiology in different environments. We developed a computational model based on a reference site (relatively unpolluted) and integrated seasonal dynamics of metabolite relative concentrations with key physiological indicators and environmental parameters. The analysis of the model revealed that changes in metabolite levels during an annual cycle are influenced by water temperature and are linked to gonadal development. This work supports the importance of data-driven biology and its potential in environmental monitoring.

TI  - Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage accompanied by changes in the patterns of chronic migraine: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has a high mortality rate, and cerebral aneurysm ruptures account for 80% of all cases. Although several previous case studies have reported a headache before aneurysmal SAH, no previous study has reported a case of SAH after a change in the existing migraine pattern without any other clinical signs. A 43-year-old male patient who had suffered chronic migraines for 10 years visited the emergency department due to migraine symptoms, which exacerbated 3 days before the visit. He was admitted for symptom management, and his condition improved after taking migraine-specific medication. However, his consciousness deteriorated, and he became drowsy 8 days from the onset of headache aggravation. Brain computed tomography angiography revealed SAH. A small ruptured aneurysm, which was not detected by brain magnetic resonance angiography performed a few days earlier, was found in the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. We performed emergency endovascular coil embolization in the right A1 without any other complications. After the procedure, his neurological symptoms no longer exacerbated during hospitalization. He showed only a mild headache after 2 weeks and was discharged. Aneurysmal SAH is one of the most devastating neurological diseases, but early detection and treatment of aneurysms before major rupture may facilitate a good prognosis. If the pattern of previously diagnosed chronic migraine changes suddenly, a minor leak before the major rupture of a cerebral aneurysm should be considered, even if a sentinel headache has not been suggested.

TI  - Accurate extraction of surface water in complex environment based on Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize the accurate extraction of surface water in complex environment, this study takes Sri Lanka as the study area owing to the complex geography and various types of water bodies. Based on Google Earth engine and Sentinel-2 images, an automatic water extraction model in complex environment(AWECE) was developed. The accuracy of water extraction by AWECE, NDWI, MNDWI and the revised version of multi-spectral water index (MuWI-R) models was evaluated from visual interpretation and quantitative analysis. The results show that the AWECE model could significantly improve the accuracy of water extraction in complex environment, with an overall accuracy of 97.16%, and an extremely low omission error (0.74%) and commission error (2.35%). The AEWCE model could effectively avoid the influence of cloud shadow, mountain shadow and paddy soil on water extraction accuracy. The model can be widely applied in cloudy, mountainous and other areas with complex environments, which has important practical significance for water resources investigation, monitoring and protection.

TI  - Deriving corn and soybeans fractions with Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) imagery by accounting for endmember variability on Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely mapping of corn and soybean plays an important role in food security in the USA. A subpixel fraction derived from Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) imagery during growing seasons is desired in order to help local farmers monitor crop growth and manage them in a timely fashion. However, two obstacles need to be surpassed before such fractional information can be made available: 1) the endmember spectral reflectance of corn and soybean varies with time and location; 2) no methods have been tested for deriving fractional maps of corn and soybean throughout the growing season. Therefore, in this research, we have set aside two objectives: 1) To account for endmember variability of corn and soybean during their growing seasons; 2) To derive multi-temporal fractional maps for corn and soybeans with Landsat and monitor the growing status of corn and soybean. Accordingly, we employed three endmember optimization methods and the state-of-the-art unmixing method Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to acquire corn and soybean fractional maps based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). Applying the method on Landsat 8 images from April to September 2017, we generated multi-temporal fractional maps of corn and soybean in Grundy County and analysed their changes. Up to 94.76% of our study area was successfully explained by the unmixing model. The crop fraction in both corn and soybean fields was about 15.00% during the planting stage, and increased to nearly 80.00% in the peak growing season. The crop fractions remained high during harvest, which could be attributed to crop residues in the field. These findings correspond well with the growth stages provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). That the corn growing season was earlier than soybeans was also well represented by the fractional change analysis. Moreover, among all the fractional maps, the results in the peak growing time (29 July 2017 in this study) had the highest agreement with classification results, with an overall accuracy of 85.07%. This research shows the great potential of monitoring corn and soybean growth conditions with fractional maps. The methods in this study, implemented in GEE, can be easily transferred to other crops and other locations.

TI  - The influence of dusts on radiation and temperature over the eastern Asia with a regional climate model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the climate effects of dusts, a regional climate model (RegCM 4.6) with the dust scheme was used to simulate the direct radiative forcing and air temperature response at 2 m near surface of dusts over the eastern Asia. Two sets of experiments were conducted, one with and one without dust aerosols. The experiment covered the main dust occurrence months from March to May for 8 years (2011-2018), and the simulation results were evaluated against ground station, reanalysis and satellite data. The model captured the spatiotemporal distribution of dust AOD and mass loading over the eastern Asia. However, it tended to underestimate the dust AOD and mass loading over the downwind of the dust source region and the Taldimakan Desert, and overestimate them over the north Xinjiang. The direct net radiative forcing including shortwave and longwave was up to -20 W.m(2) at the surface and -10 W.m(2) at the TOA over the dust source region due to the dominant negative shortwave forcing. The only exception of positive forcing at the TOA was observed along the western boundaries of the Tibetan Plateau due to the semi-persistent ice and snow cover. The dusts tended to warm the atmosphere more than 18 W.m(-2) and cool the surface locally up to -0.7 degrees C. Among the 5 sub-areas, the largest averaged regional direct radiative forcing induced by dusts appeared over the central Inner Mongolia in May with the value of -3.0 +/- 2.1, -12.2 +/- 4.1 and 9.2 +/- 4.4 W.m(-2) at the TOA, surface and in the atmosphere, respectively. The results indicated that the model simulation for dusts should be further improved and the dust effects should be included in the estimates of climate change over the eastern Asia.

TI  - The retrieval of snow properties from SLSTR Sentinel-3-Part 1: Method description and sensitivity study
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm has been designed for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance measured by the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument on board Sentinel-3 to derive snow properties: snow grain size (SGS), snow particle shape (SPS) and specific surface area (SSA) under cloud-free conditions. This is the first part of the paper, to describe the retrieval method and the sensitivity study. Nine pre-defined SPSs (aggregate of 8 columns, droxtal, hollow bullet rosette, hollow column, plate, aggregate of 5 plates, aggregate of 10 plates, solid bullet rosette, column) are used to describe the snow optical properties. The optimal SGS and SPS are estimated iteratively utilizing a look-up-table (LUT) approach. The SSA is then calculated using another pre-calculated LUT for the retrieved SGS and SPS. The optical properties (e.g., phase function) of the ice crystals can reproduce the wavelength-dependent and angular-dependent snow reflectance features, compared to laboratory measurements. A comprehensive study to understand the impact of aerosols, SPS, ice crystal surface roughness, cloud contamination, instrument spectral response function, the snow habit mixture model and snow vertical inhomogeneity in the retrieval accuracy of snow properties has been performed based on SCIATRAN radiative transfer simulations. The main findings are (1) snow angular and spectral reflectance features can be described by the predefined ice crystal properties only when both SGS and SPS can be optimally and iteratively obtained; (2) the impact of ice crystal surface roughness on the retrieval results is minor; (3) SGS and SSA show an inverse linear relationship; (4) the retrieval of SSA assuming a non-convex particle shape, compared to a convex particle shape (e.g., sphere), shows larger retrieval results; (5) aerosol/cloud contamination due to unperfected atmospheric correction and cloud screening introduces underestimation of SGS, "inaccurate" SPS and overestimation of SSA; (6) the impact of the instrument spectral response function introduces an overestimation into retrieved SGS, introduces an underestimation into retrieved SSA and has no impact on retrieved SPS; and (7) the investigation, by taking an ice crystal particle size distribution and habit mixture into account, reveals that XBAER-retrieved SGS agrees better with the mean size, rather than with the mode size, for a given particle size distribution.

TI  - The retrieval of snow properties from SLSTR Sentinel-3-Part 2: Results and validation
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the performance of the eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm, presented in the Part 1 companion paper to this paper, we apply the XBAER algorithm to the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument on board Sentinel-3. Snow properties - snow grain size (SGS), snow particle shape (SPS) and specific surface area (SSA) - are derived under cloud-free conditions. XBAER-derived snow properties are compared to other existing satellite products and validated by ground-based and aircraft measurements. The atmospheric correction is performed on SLSTR for cloud-free scenarios using Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the aerosol typing strategy according to the standard XBAER algorithm. The optimal SGS and SPS are estimated iteratively utilizing a look-up-table (LUT) approach, minimizing the difference between SLSTR-observed and SCIATRAN-simulated surface directional reflectances at 0.55 and 1.6 mu m. The SSA is derived for a retrieved SGS and SPS pair. XBAER-derived SGS, SPS and SSA have been validated using in situ measurements from the recent campaign SnowEx17 during February 2017. The comparison shows a relative difference between the XBAER-derived SGS and SnowEx17-measured SGS of less than 4 %. The difference between the XBAER-derived SSA and SnowEx17-measured SSA is 2.7m(2)/kg. XBAER-derived SPS can be reasonably explained by the SnowEx17-observed snow particle shapes. Intensive validation shows that (1) for SGS and SSA, XBAER-derived results show high correlation with field-based measurements, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.85. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of SGS and SSA are around 12 mu m and 6 m(2)/kg. (2) For SPS, aggregate SPS retrieved by XBAER algorithm is likely to be matched with rounded grains while single SPS in XBAER is possibly linked to faceted crystals.The comparison with aircraft measurements, during the Polar Airborne Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model Simulation Project (PAMARCMiP) campaign held in March 2018, also shows good agreement (with R = 0.82 and R = 0.81 for SGS and SSA, respectively). XBAER-derived SGS and SSA reveal the variability in the aircraft track of the PAMARCMiP campaign. The comparison between XBAER-derived SGS results and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow-Covered Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) product over Greenland shows similar spatial distributions. The geographic distribution of XBAER-derived SPS over Greenland and the whole Arctic can be reasonably explained by campaign-based and laboratory investigations, indicating a reasonable retrieval accuracy of the retrieved SPS. The geographic variabilities in XBAER-derived SGS and SSA both over Greenland and Arctic-wide agree with the snow metamorphism process.

TI  - West Nile Virus Seroprevalence in a Selected Donkey Population of Namibia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus enzootically maintained in birds. However, it can incidentally infect other species, leading to sometimes severe clinical consequences like in horses and especially human beings. Despite the topic relevance, the presence and distribution of WNV are currently unknown in Namibia. Several countries implement surveillance systems based on virus detection in birds, mosquitoes, and vertebrate species including horses. The present study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by serologically evaluating WNV exposure in Namibian donkeys, whose population is remarkably bigger than the horse one. Forty-seven out of 260 sampled animals showed neutralizing antibodies against WNV (18.07% [95% CI = 13.59-23.30%]), demonstrating its circulation in all country territory, although, with apparent regional differences. On the contrary, no association with animal age or sex could be identified. The present study demonstrates the widespread presence of WNV in Namibia as well as the practical utility and effectiveness of donkeys as sentinels for infection surveillance. Due to clinical relevance, vaccination campaigns should be considered for horses of high economic or genetic value. Additionally, the burden of WNV infection on human health should be carefully evaluated.

TI  - The use of radar and optical satellite imagery combined with advanced machine learning and metaheuristic optimization techniques to detect and quantify above ground biomass of intertidal seagrass in a New Zealand estuary
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass provides numerous valuable ecosystem services across a wide range of climatic regions. However, in terms of area and habitat, this resource is in decline globally and there is an urgent need for accurate mapping of extant meadows and biomass to support sustainable seagrass blue carbon conservation and management. This study develops a novel method for a binary mapping of seagrass distribution and estimating seagrass above-ground biomass (AGB) by applying a suite of advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms combined with and without a metaheuristic optimization approach (particle swarm optimization - PSO) to various combinations of multispectral (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) remote sensing data. Our results reveal that the Sentinel-1 data has potential for the binary mapping of seagrass meadows using an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model (scores of precision (P) = 0.82, recall (R) = 0.90, and F (1) = 0.86) but is less effective at estimating AGB. The optimal method for estimation of AGB used both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the XGB model, and PSO optimization (coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.75, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.35, Akaike information criteria (AIC) = 24.80, Bayesian information criteria (BIC) = 44.70). Our findings contribute novel and advanced methods for seagrass detection and improvement of AGB estimation, which are fast and reliable, use open-source data and software and should be easily applicable to intertidal zones across many regions of the world.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel study: remote-sensing image translation between high-resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data through machine learning approaches. To this end, conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) have been proposed with the guide of high-level image features. Efficiency of the proposed methods have been verified with different SAR parameters on three regions from the world: Toronto, Vancouver in Canada and Shanghai in China. The generated SAR and optical images have been evaluated by pixel-based image classification with detailed land cover types including: low and high-density residential area, industry area, construction site, golf course, water, forest, pasture and crops. Results showed that the translated image could effectively keep many land cover types with compatible classification accuracy to the ground truth data. In comparison with state-of-the-art image translation approaches, the proposed methods could improve the translation results under the criteria of common similarity indicators. This is one of first study on multi-source remote-sensing data translation by machine learning.

Defiant citizenship affirms membership of the state, but on terms that assert the primacy of residents' right of belonging in, and sovereignty over, the place of Hangberg, even against the will of the state. This form of citizenship is rooted in long-standing experience of racial, economic and cultural marginality, deep disappointment with the post-apartheid order, and a strong attachment to local place.The defiant citizenship of Hangberg is explained by national and local, as well as international, dynamics. International dynamics centre on the precarity of tenure linked to the neo-liberalisation of property relations. National dynamics centre on perceptions of enduring and systemic racial exclusion from the post-apartheid order, and local dynamics refer to a history of local place-making associated with the environment of the sea and the mountain. We show how residents of Hangberg have constructed a new form of political subjectivity from a marginal and racialised position that disrupts citizen/foreigner notions of inclusion and exclusion, and reclaims marginality through implicit and explicit appeals to belonging and local sovereignty of place.

TI  - Application of stacking hybrid machine learning algorithms in delineating multi-type flooding in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the most devastating natural hazards in Bangladesh. The country experiences multi-type floods (i.e., fluvial, flash, pluvial, and surge floods) every year. However, areas prone to multi-type floods have not yet been assessed on a national scale. Here, we used locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), random subspace (RSS), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), random forest (RF), and M5P model tree algorithms in a hybrid ensemble to assess multi-type flood probabilities at a national scale in Bangladesh. We used historical flood data (1988-2020), remote sensing images (e.g., MODIS, Landsat 5-8, and Sentinel-1), and topography, hydrogeology, and environmental datasets to train and validate the proposed algorithms. According to the results, the stacking ensemble machine learning LWLR-RF algorithm performed better than the other algorithms in predicting flood probabilities, with R2 = 0.967-0.999, MAE = 0.022-0.117, RMSE = 0.029-0.148, RAE = 4.48-23.38%, and RRSE = 5.8829.69% for the training and testing datasets. Furthermore, true skill statistics (TSS: 0.929-0.967), corrected classified instances (CCI: 96.45-98.35), area under the curve (AUC: 0.983-0.997), and Gini coefficients (0.966-0.994) were computed to validate the constructed (LWLR-RF) multi-type flood probability maps. The maps constructed via the LWLR-RF algorithm revealed that the proportions of different categories of flooding areas in Bangladesh are fluvial flooding 1.50%, 5.71%, 12.66%, and 13.77% of the total land area; flash floods of 4.16%, 8.90%, 11.11%, and 5.07%; pluvial flooding: 5.72%, 3.25%, 5.07%, and 0.90%; and surge flooding, 1.69%, 1.04%, 0.52%, and 8.64% of the total land area, respectively. These percentages represent low, medium, high, and very high probabilities of flooding. The findings can guide future flood risk management and sustainable land-use planning in the study area.

TI  - Traces of sunlight in the organic matter biogeochemistry of two shallow subarctic lakes
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global environmental change alters the production, terrestrial export, and photodegradation of organic carbon in northern lakes. Sedimentary biogeochemical records can provide a unique means to understand the nature of these changes over long time scales, where observational data fall short. We deployed in situ experiments on two shallow subarctic lakes with contrasting light regimes; a clear tundra lake and a dark woodland lake, to first investigate the photochemical transformation of carbon and nitrogen elemental (C/N ratio) and isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) composition in lake water particulate organic matter (POM) for downcore inferences. We then explored elemental, isotopic, and spectral (inferred lake water total organic carbon [TOC] and sediment chlorophyll a [CHLa]) fingerprints in the lake sediments to trace changes in aquatic production, terrestrial inputs and photodegradation before and after profound human impacts on the global carbon cycle prompted by industrialization. POM pool in both lakes displayed tentative evidence of UV photoreactivity, reflected as increasing delta C-13 and decreasing C/N values. Through time, the tundra lake sediments traced subtle shifts in primary production, while the woodland lake carried signals of changing terrestrial contributions, indicating shifts in terrestrial carbon export but possibly also photodegradation rates. Under global human impact, both lakes irrespective of their distinct carbon regimes displayed evidence of increased productivity but no conspicuous signs of increased terrestrial influence. Overall, sediment biogeochemistry can integrate a wealth of information on carbon regulation in northern lakes, while our results also point to the importance of considering the entire spectrum of photobiogeochemical fingerprints in sedimentary studies.

TI  - Aboveground biomass patterns across treeless northern landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground vegetation biomass in northern treeless landscapes - peatlands and Arctic tundra - has been modelled with spectral information derived from optical remote sensing in several studies. However, synthesized overviews of biomass patterns across circumpolar sites have been limited. Based on data from eight study sites in Europe, Siberia and Canada, we ask (1) how biomass is divided between plant functional types (PFTs) and (2) how well biomass patterns can be detected with widely available, moderate spatial resolution (3-10 m) satellite imagery and topographic data. We explain biomass patterns using random forest regressions with the predictors being spectral bands and indices calculated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery and topographic information calculated from ArcticDEM data. Our results indicate that there are notable differences in vegetation composition between northern landscapes with mosses, graminoids and deciduous shrubs being the most dominant PFTs. Remote sensing data detects biomass patterns, but regression performance varies between sites (explained variance 36-70%, normalized root mean square error 9-19%). There is also variability between sites whether Sentinel-2 or PlanetScope data is more suitable to detect biomass patterns and which the most important predictors are. Topographic information has a minor or negligible importance in most of the sites. Our results suggest that there is no easily generalizable relationship between satellite-derived vegetation greenness and biomass.

TI  - National trends for axillary lymph node dissection and survival outcomes for clinical T3/T4 node-negative breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with positive lymph nodes
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Previous studies have suggested axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in early breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with positive lymph nodes (LNs). We assessed the national utilization of ALND and overall survival (OS) for larger, locally advanced tumors in patients undergoing mastectomy with positive LNs. Methods The National Cancer Database from 2006 to 2016 was queried for mastectomy patients with clinical T3/T4, N0 tumors, and 1-2 positive LNs. Trends and outcomes for ALND were compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone. Results Thousand nine hundred and seventeen women were included. The proportion of ALND decreased from 70% pre-Z0011 to 52% post-Z0011. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, ALND had better OS compared to SLNB alone (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, age (p < 0.01), chemotherapy (p < 0.01), and hormonal therapy (p < 0.01) were associated with better OS. In patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) ALND improved OS on multivariate analysis (p < 0.01). Conclusion This is the first large database study to demonstrate a national trend to forego ALND in mastectomy patients with large or locally advanced tumors (T3/T4abc) and 1-2 positive lymph nodes. This study suggests a survival benefit for ALND, particularly in patients receiving ART. Careful consideration and further investigations should be performed prior to omitting ALND this patient population.

TI  - Hybrid point and interval prediction approaches for drought modeling using ground-based and remote sensing data
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought as a severe natural disaster has devastating effects on the environment; therefore, reliable drought prediction is an important issue. In the current study, based on lower upper bound estimation, hybrid models including data preprocessing, permutation entropy, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods were used for point and interval predictions of short- to longterm series of Standardized Precipitation Index in the Northwest of Iran. Ground-based and remote sensing precipitation data were used covering the period of 1983-2017. In the modeling process, first, the data processing capability via variational mode decomposition (VMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and permutation entropy (PE) was investigated in drought point prediction. Then, interval prediction was applied for tolerating increased uncertainty and providing more details for practical operation decisions. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed integrated models could achieve significantly better performance compared to single models. Hybrid PE models increased the modeling accuracy up to 40 and 55%. Finally, the efficiency of developed models was verified for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index prediction. Results demonstrated that the proposed methodology based on remote sensing data and VMD-PE-AI approaches could be successfully used for drought modeling, especially in limited or non-gauged areas.

TI  - Digital mapping of zinc in urban topsoil using multisource geospatial data and random forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to map the spatial patterns of Zn in urban topsoil by using multisource geospatial data and machine learning method. Geological map, digital elevation models, and Landsat images were used to extract data related to geology, relief, and land use types and a vegetation index. Urban functional types were derived from the fusion of Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre 5 images, points of interest, and real-time Tencent user data. A geodetector was adopted to select key environmental covariates. Random forest (RF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were employed to model and map Zn concentrations in urban topsoil. The results showed that urban functional type, geology, NDVI, elevation, slope, and aspect were key environmental covariates. Compared with land use types, urban functional types could better reflect the spatial variation in Zn. The RF and GWR models were established using the key environmental covariates, with leave-one-out cross-validated R values of 0.68 and 0.58 and root mean square errors of 0.51 and 0.57, respectively. The results indicated that digital mapping of Zn in urban topsoil by using multisource geospatial data and RF was feasible. RF might be more suitable to fit the stochastic characteristics of Zn in urban topsoils than GWR, which considers deterministic trends in modeling. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Feasibility of Axillary Lymph Node Localization and Excision Using Radar Reflector Localization
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar reflector localization (RRL) clips can mark positive lymph nodes for targeted axillary dissection (TAD) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We reviewed 45 consecutive patients treated with NAC and RRL-guided TAD. The RRL node was identified as the sentinel lymph node in 36 (80%) patients. RRL-guided TAD after NAC is safe and feasible and allows for adequate nodal assessment to confirm excision of the positive axillary node.Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly used for patients with clinically detected nodal metastases. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC is feasible. Excision of biopsy-proven positive lymph nodes in addition to SLNB, termed targeted axillary dissection (TAD), decreases the false-negative rate of SLNB alone. Positive nodes can be marked with radar reflector-localization (RRL) clips. We report our institutional experience with RRL-guided TAD and demonstrate its safety and feasibility. Patients and Methods: We performed an institutional review board-approved retrospective review of consecutive clinically node-positive female patients with breast cancer treated with NAC and RRL-guided TAD between January 2017 and September 2019. Clinicopathologic and treatment data were collected; descriptive statistics are reported. Results: Forty-five patients were analyzed; the median age was 55 years (range, 20-72 years), and the median body mass index was 27.2 kg/m(2) (range, 16.5-40.4 kg/m(2)). All patients received NAC, primary breast surgery, and TAD. All clinically detected nodal metastases were confirmed with percutaneous biopsy and marked with a biopsy clip. RRL clips were implanted a median of 8 days (range, 1-167 days) prior to surgery; all were retrieved without complications. The RRL node was identified as the sentinel lymph node in 36 (80%) patients. Twenty-five patients had positive nodes, of which 24 were identified by RRL node excision, and 1 (4%) patient had a positive node identified by SLNB but not RRL. Over a median follow-up time of 29.6 months, 5 patients recurred (1 local, 4 distant). Conclusions: RRL-guided TAD after NAC is safe and feasible. This technique allows for adequate assessment of the nodal basin and helps confirm excision of the previously biopsied positive axillary node. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Regulation of lymphangiogenesis by extracellular vesicles in cancer metastasis
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Metastasis is not only one of the hallmarks of cancer but, unfortunately, it also is the most accurate biomarker for poor prognosis. Cancer cells metastasize through two different but eventually merged routes, the vasculature and lymphatic systems. The processes of cancer metastasis through blood vessel have been extensively studied and are well documented in the literature. In contrast, metastasis through the lymphatic system is less studied. Most people believe that cancer cells metastasize through lymphatic vessel are passive because the lymphatic system is thought to be a sewage draining system that collects whatever appears in the tissue fluid. It was recently found that cancer cells disseminated from lymphatic vessels are protected from being destroyed by our body's defense system. Furthermore, some cancer cells or cancer-associated immune cells secrete lymphangiogenic factors to recruit lymphatic vessel infiltration to the tumor region, a process known as lymphangiogenesis. To ensure the efficiency of lymphangiogenesis, the lymphangiogenic mediators are carried or packed by nanometer-sized particles named extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles are lipid bilayer particles released from eventually every single cell, including bacterium, with diameters ranging from 30 nm (exosome) to several micrometers (apoptotic body). Components carried by extracellular vesicles include but are not limited to DNA, RNA, protein, fatty acid, and other metabolites. Recent studies suggest that cancer cells not only secrete more extracellular vesicles but also upload critical mediators required for lymphatic metastasis onto extracellular vesicles. This review will summarize recent advances in cancer lymphatic metastasis and how cancer cells regulate this process via extracellular vesicle-dependent lymphangiogenesis.

TI  - Predictors of free-roaming domestic dogs' contact network centrality and their relevance for rabies control
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Free roaming domestic dogs (FRDD) are the main vectors for rabies transmission to humans worldwide. To eradicate rabies from a dog population, current recommendations focus on random vaccination with at least 70% coverage. Studies suggest that targeting high-risk subpopulations could reduce the required vaccination coverage, and increase the likelihood of success of elimination campaigns. The centrality of a dog in a contact network can be used as a measure of its potential contribution to disease transmission. Our objectives were to investigate social networks of FRDD in eleven study sites in Chad, Guatemala, Indonesia and Uganda, and to identify characteristics of dogs, and their owners, associated with their centrality in the networks. In all study sites, networks had small-world properties and right-skewed degree distributions, suggesting that vaccinating highly connected dogs would be more effective than random vaccination. Dogs were more connected in rural than urban settings, and the likelihood of contacts was negatively correlated with the distance between dogs' households. While heterogeneity in dog's connectedness was observed in all networks, factors predicting centrality and likelihood of contacts varied across networks and countries. We therefore hypothesize that the investigated dog and owner characteristics resulted in different contact patterns depending on the social, cultural and economic context. We suggest to invest into understanding of the sociocultural structures impacting dog ownership and thus driving dog ecology, a requirement to assess the potential of targeted vaccination in dog populations.

TI  - Management of vegetative land for more water yield under future climate conditions in the over-utilized water resources regions: A case study in the Xiong'an New area
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seeking more water yield in the over-utilized water resources regions that are home to nearly 35% of the population all over the world is a great challenge under future climate change. Impacts of land conversion (i.e., land conversion from cropland to grassland and forest) and climate change during near-future 2030s (2021-2040), mid-future 2050s (2041-2060), and far-future 2080s (2071-2090) periods on vegetation dynamics (LAI) and water budgets (evapotranspiration and runoff) were investigated in a typical over-utilized water resources area of China (Xiong'an New Area, XNA) using the WAVES ecohydrological model. Future climate change impacts were assessed with statistically downscaled forcing of 18 global circulation models (GCMs) under three representative concentration pathways (PCPs) using secondary bias-correction technique. Projected future climate indicated that XNA would become warmer and wetter in future. The WAVES model was calibrated against remotely sensed LAI and ET data. Modeling results during the historical period of 1982-2012 showed that forest evaporated more water (32.0 mm yr(-1)) than cropland, while grassland used almost the same amount of water as cropland. Under future climate conditions, both water use and water yield would increase in cropland and grassland due to increased precipitation. Forest was predicted to use 9.5-14.6% (36.4-55.8 mm yr(-1)) more water and to have 2.6-52.4% (2.6-51.1 mm yr(-1)) more water yield in the 2050s and 2080s under RCP4.5 and in all three future periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2080s) under RCP8.5 due to greater increases in precipitation. Afforestation is not recommended as a land management practice for more water yield in near-future, but could be implemented to achieve a win-win situation for more water yield and more forest coverage in mid- and far-future periods in XNA due to increased precipitation. This study highlights that uncertainties in projected future climate pose formidable challenges in management of vegetative land for more water yield in the over-utilized water resources regions.

TI  - Magnetic and tidal migration of close-in planets: Influence of secular evolution on their population
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Over the last two decades, a large population of close-in planets has been detected around a wide variety of host stars. Such exoplanets are likely to undergo planetary migration through magnetic and tidal interactions.Aims. We aim to follow the orbital evolution of a planet along the structural and rotational evolution of its host star, simultaneously taking into account tidal and magnetic torques, in order to explain some properties of the distribution of observed close-in planets.Methods. We rely on a numerical model of a coplanar circular star-planet system called ESPEM, which takes into account stellar structural changes, wind braking, and star-planet interactions. We browse the parameter space of the star-planet system configurations and assess the relative influence of magnetic and tidal torques on its secular evolution. We then synthesize star-planet populations and compare their distribution in orbital and stellar rotation periods to Kepler satellite data.Results. Magnetic and tidal interactions act together on planetary migration and stellar rotation. Furthermore, both interactions can dominate secular evolution depending on the initial configuration of the system and the evolutionary phase considered. Indeed, tidal effects tend to dominate for high stellar and planetary masses as well as low semi-major axis; they also govern the evolution of planets orbiting fast rotators while slower rotators evolve essentially through magnetic interactions. Moreover, three populations of star-planet systems emerge from the combined action of both kinds of interactions. First, systems undergoing negligible migration define an area of influence of star-planet interactions. For sufficiently large planetary magnetic fields, the magnetic torque determines the extension of this region. Next, planets close to fast rotators migrate efficiently during the pre-main sequence, which engenders a depleted region at low rotation and orbital periods. Then, the migration of planets close to slower rotators, which happens during the main sequence, may lead to a break in gyrochronology for high stellar and planetary masses. This also creates a region at high rotation periods and low orbital periods not populated by star-planet systems. We also find that star-planet interactions significantly impact the global distribution in orbital periods by depleting more planets for higher planetary masses and planetary magnetic fields. However, the global distribution in stellar rotation periods is marginally affected, as around 0.5% of G-type stars and 0.1% of K-type stars may spin up because of planetary engulfment. More precisely, star-planet magnetic interactions significantly affect the distribution of super-Earths around stars with a rotation period higher than around 5 days, which improves the agreement between synthetic populations and observations at orbital periods of less than 1 day. Tidal effects for their part shape the distribution of giant planets.

TI  - The immediate impact of the associated COVID-19's lockdown campaign on the native vegetation recovery of Wadi Al Batin Tri-state desert
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Law enforcement and massive media awareness, limiting the anthropogenic disturbance, is the way to go for implementing successful desert native vegetation recovery plans. A lesson learned on the resiliency of desert ecosystems throughout studying the native vegetation coverage in the Wadi Al-Batin desert ecosystem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wadi Al-Batin tri-state desert (89,315 km(2)) covers the South-western part of Iraq, State of Kuwait, and the North-eastern part of Saudi Arabia. In this study, the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage was detected, by using Sentinel-2A imageries, during the period from 2017 to 2020. For better understanding the impact of associated law enforcement and media practices during COVID-19 pandemic, native vegetation coverage of years with relevant rainfall records were compared. The results revealed that despite receiving the least amount of rain of the three years (<= 93 mm), the COVID-19 year (2020) had the highest native vegetation coverage at 28.5% compared with 6% in 2017, and 2% in 2018. These results prove that the main drivers of desert vegetation deterioration are anthmpogenic activities, such as quarrying, overgrazing, distractive camping, and off-road vehicle movements. Moreover, the estimated 63% vegetation coverage in Wadi Al-Batin desert in 2019 assures the significant role of precipitation in desert vegetation recovery. This bulk increase in vegetation coverage detected during COVID-19 pandemic shows that the desert vegetation adapts to harsh environments (low rainfall) and rapidly recovers once the source of the disturbance was removed by enforcing the environmental rules. Thus, the protection of natural resources and ecosystems can be achieved through the synergy between governments and civil communities, including intensive awareness of environmental impacts via media, enforcing environmental regulations, and promoting regional collaboration.

TI  - An ensemble deep learning method as data fusion system for remote sensing multisensor classification
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the great achievements in designing remote sensing sensors, the extraction of useful information from multisource remote sensing data remains a challenging problem. Most of the recent research projects have applied single deep learning systems for data fusion and classification. The idea of using ensemble deep learning algorithms through a multisensor fusion system can improve the performance of data fusion tasks. In this research, however, a multi-sensor classification strategy, which is based on deep learning ensemble procedure and decision fusion framework, is investigated for the fusion of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Hyperspectral Images (HS), and very high-resolution Visible (Vis) images. This research proposes a basic classifier based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in which the softmax layer is replaced by a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM). Then, a random feature selection is applied to generate two separate CNN-SVM ensemble systems, one for LiDAR and Vis and the other one for HS data. To overcome the similarity and overfitting between the deep features and the classifiers provided by two ensemble systems and to select the best subsets of the classifiers, two diversity measures select the most diverse combinations of the classifiers. Finally, a decision fusion method combines the obtained diverse classifiers from CNN ensembles. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy, and its performance outperforms some of the existing methods. The proposed ensemble CNN method improved single deep CNN, random forest, and Adaboost between 2% to 10% in terms of classification accuracy. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Like a fish in water: Habitus adaptation mechanisms of informal tourism entrepreneurs in Thailand
T2  - ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates possible pathways of habitus change by informal tourism entrepreneurs in Thailand. Bourdieu's concept of habitus is depicted as a person's understanding of the world. Do people adapt their worldview in response to only external stimuli? Through ethnographic fieldwork including participant observations and active semi-structured interviews with 53 participants, this paper identifies a classification of four modes of habitus adaptation: (1) Understanding and appreciating the field and its conditions, (2) Challenging core beliefs systems, (3) Applying a practical sense to 'objective possibilities', and, (4) Challenging non reflective dispositions. We argue that charting the modes of habitus adaptation could help policymakers understand the change processes of informal entrepreneurs in the tourism sector and their willingness to change.

TI  - Glacier changes in the Chhombo Chhu Watershed of the Tista basin between 1975 and 2018, the Sikkim Himalaya, India
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers of the Tista basin represent an important water source for mountain communities and a large population downstream. The article presents observable changes in the Chhombo Chhu Watershed (CCW) glacier area of the Tista basin, the Sikkim Himalaya. The CCW contains 74 glaciers (> 0.02 km(2)) with a mean glacier size of 0.61 km(2). We determined changes in glaciers from the declassified Hexagon Keyhole-9 (KH-9) (1975), Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) (1989), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) (2000), Landsat 5 TM (2010), and Sentinel-2A (2018) images The total glacier area in 1975 was 62.6 +/- 0.7 km(2); and by 2018, the area had decreased to 44.8 +/- 1.5 km(2), an area loss of 17.9 +/- 1.7 km(2)(0.42 +/- 0.04 km(2) a(-1)). Clean glaciers exhibited more area loss of 11.8 +/- 1.2 km(2) (0.27 +/- 0.03 km 2 a(-1)) than partially debris-covered and maximally debris-covered glaciers. The area loss is 5.0 +/- 0.4 km(2) (0.12 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1)) for partially covered glaciers and 1.0 +/- 0.1 km(2) (-0.02 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1)) for maximally covered glaciers. The glacier area loss in the CCW of the Sikkim Himalaya is 0.62 +/- 0.5 km(2) a(-1) during 2000-2010, and it is 0.77 +/- 0.6 km(2) a(-1) during 2010-2018. Field investigations of selected glaciers and climatic records also support the glacier recession in the CCW due to a significant increase in temperature (0.25 degrees C a(-1) ) and more or less static precipitation since 1995. The dataset is now available from the Zenodo web portal: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4457183 (Chowdhury et al., 2021).

TI  - Mapping of soil degradation in semi-arid environments in the ouarzazate basin in the south of the central High Atlas, Morocco, using sentinel 2A data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the state of soil degradation in a semi-arid environment in the southern part of the Central High Atlas of Morocco (CHA), in the vicinity of the El Mansour Eddahbi Dam in Ouarzazate. This area is subject to soil erosion and degradation issues because of its geological features, and also because of climate change and human activities. The objective of this study was to use a remote sensing space (Sentinel 2 A) to map and evaluate the current status of the land degradation risks. For this purpose, a visit to the study area was carried out to collect the coordinates of the sites of the different types of soil degradation. These were overlaid on the satellite image to obtain a more accurate extraction of the spectral reflectance from eroded, noneroded, and moderately eroded soil. This visit also provided a detailed view of the state of soil degradation in the region. Subsequently, two supervised classifications were made by the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, using the Sentinel 2 A satellite imagery, to give high spatial and spectral resolution and effective monitoring of the soil. During the investigation, the mapping and modelling models were validated based on the values of the Kappa index (86% for SAM and 75% for SVM) and the convolution matrix of the two types of classifications, as well as the results of the calculation and the analysis of a set of spectral indexes and new components such as normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), the color index (CI), the brightness index (BI) and two main components (PC1 and PC4). The SAM classification revealed that 18.44% of the soils are weakly degraded, 36.45% are moderately degraded and 27.74% are highly degraded. However, the SVM classification showed that about 36.16% of the soils are weakly degraded, 17.85% are moderately degraded, and 29.35% are strongly degraded. The highly degraded lands are found more in the northern part of the dam, which is intersected by a network of affluents originating from the southern slopes of the Central High Atlas (CHA). These affluents facilitate the phenomenon of water erosion. Geologically, the soils in the northern part of the dam correspond to recent formations (alluvium and silt) of the river valleys, and abrupt lateral slopes. Most of these soils also concern facies related to the Meso-Cenozoic cover, whereas in the southern part of the dam the soils are less degraded and all correspond to very resistant lithological facies (magmatic and metamorphic formations of the Precambrian basement (granites, eruptive rocks, and schists)). We conclude that the short and easy approach used in this research can be a powerful decision-making tool for protecting soils in semi-arid environments.

TI  - Modeling the Effects of Religious Belief and Affiliation on Prosociality
T2  - SECULARISM & NONRELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - To what extent do supernatural beliefs, group affiliation, and social interaction produce values and behaviors that benefit others, i.e., prosociality? Addressing this question involves multiple variables interacting within complex social networks that shape and constrain the beliefs and behaviors of individuals. We examine the relationships among some of these factors utilizing data from the World Values Survey to inform the construction of an Agent-Based Model. The latter was able to identify the conditions under which - and the mechanisms by which - the prosociality of simulated agents was increased or decreased within an "artificial society" designed to reflect real world parameters. The combined results indicated that prosociality was more related to agents' group affiliation and social networks than to their worldview beliefs. It also showed that prosociality changed as a function of agents' worldviews, group affiliation, and social network properties. Individuals with supernatural worldviews had higher levels of active prosociality, but this was primarily directed toward ingroup members. Naturalistic believers and the unaffiliated, on the other hand, tended to have higher levels of trust and tolerance. We describe the potential usefulness of such modeling techniques for addressing complex problems in the study of secularity and nonreligion.

TI  - Using remote sensing to identify the peak of the growing season at globally-distributed flux sites: A comparison of models, sensors, and biomes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The peak of the growing season (POS) is known to play an important role in regulating the interannual variability of terrestrial carbon sequestration. Recent research has developed several models for POS estimation; however, a comprehensive understanding of the predictive ability of these models remains lacking, especially taking various biomes and satellite data from different sensors into account. Using data from 54 eddy covariance (EC) flux sites (434 site-years in total) from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, we extracted POS from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from two sensors (MODIS and SPOT-VGT), using four different methods. We then compared the model outputs when data from the different sensors were used, and across different biomes. Our results show that the model predictions correlated weakly (R-2 < 0.4) with the flux-based POS when multiple biomes were considered together. However, the performance of the models varied significantly between the models, the sensors that provided the data, and different biomes. Firstly, the more recently proposed methods did not perform as expected, and some of them performed even worse than the commonly used approach. Secondly, POS modeled from MODIS data performed slightly better than that from SPOT-VGT data. Thirdly, when the models are combined, they can reliably estimate POS for grasslands, deciduous broadleaf forests, and open shrublands, but not necessarily for other biomes. Lastly, our results indicate that NDVI-based POS is not a good proxy of flux-based POS. The study suggests that both biomes and sensor properties should be taken into account when estimating POS, and a rigorous validation is necessary before different models are implemented at regional, or larger scales. Therefore, this study provides insights that are helpful for improving our understanding of the impacts of algorithms, sensors, and biomes on model estimates of POS.

TI  - Evaluation of sonographic detectability of different markers within an in vitro simulation model of the axilla
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Clip-marking of axillary lymph nodes with initial biopsy-confirmed metastasis is required for targeted axillary dissection (TAD), which includes sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and selective localization and removal of the clipped targeted lymph node. There have been several studies which examined the feasibility of TAD in routine clinical use. In this context, the optimal clip visualisation was noted as one of the crucial limiting factors. We, therefore, evaluated the sonographic detectability of 10 different commercially available markers within an in vitro model simulating the anatomical composition of the axilla. Methods In this standardised model consisting of porcine fat with 30 mm thickness, the visibility of a total of ten markers was analysed in all 3 planes (parallel, diagonal, orthograde) with wire guidance and then classified into either "visibility good", "visibility moderate" or "visibility poor" with regard to the alignment of the transducer. Additionally, "real-life conditions" were simulated, in which the markers were searched without any wires guidance. Results It was observed that, while not all markers are detectable in fatty tissue, markers with spherical shape (non-embedded Inconel or Nitinol) or rectangular-shaped Titanium markers with embedded material have a clear advantage. 3D-shaped markers can always be detected in all three axes, which is of particular importance in the axilla with its pyramid shape and fatty tissue. Conclusion The shape and the embedding of the material play a crucial role for visibility and efficacy of the marker, as reliable marking of suspicious and pathological axillary lymph nodes is essential for TAD.

TI  - Secondary Use of COVID-19 Symptom Incidence Among Hospital Employees as an Example of Syndromic Surveillance of Hospital Admissions Within 7 Days
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Alternative methods for hospital occupancy forecasting, essential information in hospital crisis planning, are necessary in a novel pandemic when traditional data sources such as disease testing are limited.OBJECTIVE To determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data can be used as syndromic surveillance to estimate COVID-19 hospitalizations in the communities where employees live.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was conducted from April 2, 2020, to November 4, 2020, at a large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total of 2384 beds and 136 000 discharges in New England. The participants included 6841 employees who worked on-site at hospital 1 and lived in the 10 hospitals' service areas.EXPOSURE Daily employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text messaging system from a single hospital.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7-day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital census at each hospital.RESULTS Among 6841 employees living within the 10 hospitals' service areas, 5120 (74.8%) were female individuals and 3884 (56.8%) were White individuals; the mean (SD) age was 40.8 (13.6) years, and the mean (SD) time of service was 8.8 (10.4) years. The study model had a MAE of 6.9 patients with COVID-19 and a weighted MAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5 patients (weighted MAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). For context, the mean network all-cause occupancy was 1286 during this period, so an error of 6.9 is only 0.5% of the network mean occupancy. Operationally, this level of error was negligible to the incident command center. At hospital 1, a doubling of the number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponded to 4 additional employees reporting symptoms at the mean for hospital 1) was associated with a 5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at hospital 1 in 7 days (regression coefficient, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.07; P < .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study found that a real-time employee health attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to estimate subsequent hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in New England.

TI  - Characteristics of vertical atmosphere based on five-year microwave remote sensing data over Wuhan region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To enhance the understandings of the regional climatic characteristics, vertical distributions of temperature and relative humidity (RH), height of atmospheric boundary layer (ABLH), integrated water vapor (IWV), and liquid water path (LWP) were analyzed based on five-year observations from a ground-based microwave radiometer over Wuhan. Performance of ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR) was also estimated by comparing with the radiosonde (RS) data. The temperature profile measured by the microwave radiometer was better under cloudy conditions, while the RH profile had higher accuracy under cloud-free conditions. The IWV from MWR generally showed a good consistency with RS data (R2 > 0.95), whereas a slight underestimation was found under cloud-free conditions as the slope of linear regression was 0.898. Variations of temperature and humidity profiles showed a distinct seasonal cycle in this region. Two abrupt turning points happened around April and October respectively, resulting in cold winters and hot and wet summers. The highest and lowest values of temperature appeared at -15 and - 6 local time respectively and the vertical extension of temperature fluctuated between 5 and 7 km depending on the season, mainly related to incoming solar irradiation intensity. Due to the inhomogeneity of temperature changes in vertical direction, the ABLH also showed distinct diurnal (0.79-1.98 km) and seasonal (1.12-2.01 km) variations. The IWV was a unimodal distribution in a year. The minimum and maximum were found in December (-10.3 kg/m2) and July (-54.7 kg/m2). An abnormal high RH (a positive anomaly of -5.7% below 2 km) was observed in February, higher than January and March. Meanwhile, the highest average LWP (114.4 g/m2) was also observed in February. Low temperature and increasing IWV caused more water vapor to condense into water droplets and form clouds in the atmosphere, and thus the RH and LWP increased. The above findings provided estimations of microwave radiometer performance and enhanced our understandings of the regional climatic characteristics.

AB  - Objective At the end of 1 year of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we aimed to reveal the changes in breast cancer cases in the context of cause and effect based on the data of surgically treated patients in our institution.Patients and Methods Patients with breast cancer were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients who were operated in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic, and Group 2 consisted of patients who were operated within the first year of the pandemic. Tumor size, axillary lymph node positivity, distant organ metastasis status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and type of surgery performed were compared between the two groups.Results The tumor size, axillary lymph node positivity, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p = .005, p = .012, p = .042, respectively). In addition, the number of breast-conserving surgery + sentinel lymph node biopsy were lower, while the number of mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p = .034).Conclusion Patients presented with larger breast tumors and increased axillary involvement during the pandemic.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of evapotranspiration using the SEBAL algorithm and Google Earth Engine cloud computing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for several applications in water resources management. ET models using remote sensing data have flourished in recent years allowing spatial and temporal assessments at unprecedented resolutions. This study presents geeSEBAL, a new tool for automated estimation of ET, based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and a simplified version of the CIMEC (Calibration using Inverse Modeling at Extreme Conditions) process for the endmembers selection, developed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. The tool framework is introduced, and case studies across multiple biomes in Brazil are presented by comparing daily ET estimates with eddy covariance (EC) data from 10 flux towers. Based on 224 Landsat images using ERA5 Land as meteorological inputs, daily ET estimates of geeSEBAL yielded an average root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.67 mm day(-1) when compared to EC data corrected for the energy balance closure. Additional analyses indicate a low geeSEBAL sensitivity to meteorological inputs, yielding an average RMSD of 0.71 mm day(-1) when driven by in situ meteorological measurements. On the other hand, we found a higher sensitivity of the automated CIMEC algorithm to the selection of endmembers for internal calibration. For instance, by adjusting the endmembers percentiles to tropical biomes we found an error that was 36% lower compared to the standard CIMEC percentiles. Finally, we assessed the long-term effects (1984-2020) of land cover changes on surface energy fluxes and water use in agriculture for key areas in Brazil, from deforested areas in the Amazon to irrigated crops in the Pampas and Cerrado biomes. A comparison with a land surface temperature-based (SSEBop) and a vegetation-based (MOD16) model was also performed to assess relative advantages and disadvantages. This analysis showed that geeSEBAL has a significant potential for long-term assessment of ET in data-scarce areas, due to its lower sensitivity to meteorological inputs. geeSEBAL codes are written in Python and JavaScript and are freely available on GitHub (https://github. com/et-brasil/geesebal). geeSEBAL also includes a graphical user interface (https://etbrasil.org/geesebal), allowing important advances in water resources management at regional scales.

TI  - "The Awesomeness and the Vastness of Who You Really Are:" A Culturally Distinct Framework for Understanding the Link Between Spirituality and Health for Black Sexual Minority Men
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite health inequities, many Black sexual minority men are resilient and often utilize spirituality as a culturally distinct self-protective and self-enhancing resource to maintain their health. However, little is known about how spirituality impacts health within a cultural framework that is specific to Black sexual minority men. We conducted 10 individual in-depth interviews, reaching code saturation, with Black sexual minority men across the USA. Our study was guided by grounded theory and a Black psychology theoretical framework. Seven themes were discovered and revealed that participants' level of spiritual consciousness influenced their engagement in psychological and behavioral processes that were related to mental and physical health. These themes were: (a) suboptimal worldview, (b) emotional revelation, (c) emotional emancipation, (d) emotional regulation, (e) health motivations, (f) health behaviors, and (g) links between spiritual consciousness, mental health, and physical health. Implications of these findings for clinicians and researchers are discussed.

TI  - On the suitability of using vegetation indices to monitor the response of Africa's terrestrial ecoregions to drought
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought remains one of the world's most devastating phenomena, exhibiting impacts in both magnitude and frequency. African vegetation remains highly vulnerable to drought impacts and this is heightened by a changing climate. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of vegetation indices to monitor the response of Africa's terrestrial ecoregions to drought. Here, we used the SPEI, a global drought index to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought on vegetation. In addition, TVDI, TCI, VCI, NVSWI, VSWI and DSI, which are remotely sensed derived drought indices were also used to characterize drought. For the vegetation indices, we used the optical satellite calculated NDVI; VOD, a passive microwave remote sensing product; and derived Nvod as proxies for vegetation. The climatology of climate and vegetation data was calculated, and the trend of the variables was examined. Additionally, comparisons were performed between the SPEI and the other drought indices. Subsequently, we computed the correlations between the SPEI and vegetation indices spatially, temporally and seasonally.Our results show that VOD and the NDVI have similar spatial distribution, with higher values of the indices recorded over the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Central African Republic (C.A.R) compared to the rest of the region. Furthermore, we also found that the indices have similar seasonal patterns as precipitation and an inverse relationship with temperature. The study also reveals that there is a declining long-term trend of precipitation over evergreen needleleaf forest, evergreen broadleaf forest, and woody savanna; and an increasing trend of VOD and NDVI over Africa's ecoregions. Furthermore, the results show a high SPEI - VOD correlations (r(2) = 0.8) in southern Africa and the Horn of Africa, and a weak response in the Sahelian region. While the response of NDVI is similar to a spatial distribution as VOD, the magnitudes of response are generally weaker in the NDVI, and the magnitudes and distribution of response by Nvod are similar to VOD. Also, the response of Nvod is the weakest across all the timescales although its magnitudes vary significantly from year - year, with the timescale of occurrence mostly shorter for JJA but largely longer for MAM. However, the magnitudes of the response of vegetation indices are different for remotely sensed derived drought indices. In addition, the mean and trend of the response of VOD are consistently stronger in evergreen needleleaf forest and open shrublands but weaker over the evergreen broadleaf forest. Our study has presented insights on methods by which the impacts of droughts on plant activities and functions may be monitored. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of urban ecological comfort index derived from remote sensing data: a case study of Hefei, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ecological and environmental degradations have occurred widely around the world, especially in urban areas with rapid economic development, intensive human activities, and massive urbanization. We aim at proposing an effective and comprehensive urban ecological environment evaluation method based on remote sensing. Harmonic analysis of time series method and spatial-temporal information fusion based on nonlocal means filter was used to improve the quality of long-term remote sensing data from 2003 to 2019. The greenness, dryness, heat, and atmospheric turbidity of the ecological environment were represented by normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference built-up index, land surface temperature, and aerosol optical depth, respectively. An urban ecological comfort index (UECI) was established by the weighted combination of the above four indicators using entropy method. UECI was calculated at seasonal and annual scales from 2003 to 2019 in Hefei city, China, as a case study. Furthermore, Mann-Kendall trend test, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and spatial clustering analysis were performed on the UECI results. The experimental results show that UECI in Hefei had an increasing trend from 0.5446 to 0.5737 between 2003 and 2019, indicating that its ecological environment is actively improving. UECI is roughly equal in spring, summer, and autumn, and the worst is in winter. The responses of UECI to urban expansion, environmental protection policies, and extreme weather were also explored. Its sensitively analysis results and the fact that the spatial-temporal trends of UECI were consistent with the influencing factors reflected the stability and reliability of UECI, indicating that the proposed UECI performed well in Hefei and could be applied to measure urban ecological comfort level in other study areas.

T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - MetCoOp is a Nordic collaboration on operational Numerical Weather Prediction based on a common limited-area km-scale ensemble system. The initial states are produced using a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme utilizing a large amount of observations from conventional in-situ measurements, weather radars, global navigation satellite system, advanced scatterometer data and satellite radiances from various satellite platforms. A version of the forecasting system which is aimed for future operations has been prepared for an enhanced assimilation of microwave radiances. This enhanced data assimilation system will use radiances from the Microwave Humidity Sounder, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A and the Micro-Wave Humidity Sounder-2 instruments on-board the Metop-C and Fengyun-3 C/D polar orbiting satellites. The implementation process includes channel selection, set-up of an adaptive bias correction procedure, and careful monitoring of data usage and quality control of observations. The benefit of the additional microwave observations in terms of data coverage and impact on analyses, as derived using the degree of freedom of signal approach, is demonstrated. A positive impact on forecast quality is shown, and the effect on the precipitation for a case study is examined. Finally, the role of enhanced data assimilation techniques and adaptions towards nowcasting are discussed.

AB  - Study region: Lake Hawassa, Ethiopian Rift Valley, Southern Region, Ethiopia.Study focus: Lake Hawassa is one of the major Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes with an endorheic basin system located near Hawassa town. The Lake water is vital to the surrounding communities for irrigation, domestic water supply, recreation, and fish harvesting. The morphological changes due to flood water from the surrounding agricultural areas were noticed and the water quality deteriorates which will be reflecting the agricultural productivity in the region and negatively impacted the socio-economic development. The lake morphometric changes were investigated by using cartographic ArcGIS mapping and bathymetric mapping and during the analysis, the thermal Infrared data of Landsat (TM) was used in the digital elevation model (30 x 30 m) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The morphometric changes for a period of 46 years were considered in this study. The Secchi discs and echo-sounder were used to during the preparation of bathymetric maps and kriging interpolation was used for the water depth assessment of the lake.New hydrological insights for the Lake: The surface area of the Lake increased by 11.28 % from 1973 to 2019. The depth and volume decreased by 33.04 % and 25.32 %, respectively over the same period. The observed Secchi disc depth was 2.06 m. It was found that the increased surface area due to sedimentation and eutrophication in the Lake.

TI  - A review of the frequencies of Plasmodium falciparum Kelch 13 artemisinin resistance mutations in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Artemisinin resistance (AR) emerged in South East Asia 13 years ago and the identification of the resistance conferring molecular marker, Plasmodium falciparum Kelch 13 (Pfk13), 7 years ago has provided an invaluable tool for monitoring AR in malaria endemic countries. Molecular Pfk13 surveillance revealed the resistance foci in the Greater Mekong Subregion, an independent emergence in Guyana, South America, and a low frequency of mutations in Africa. The recent identification of the R561H Pfk13 AR associated mutation in Tanzania, Uganda and in Rwanda, where it has been associated with delayed parasite clearance, should be a concern for the continent. In this review, we provide a summary of Pfk13 resistance associated propeller domain mutation frequencies across Africa from 2012 to 2020, to examine how many other countries have identified these mutations. Only four African countries reported a recent identification of the M476I, P553L, R561H, P574L, C580Y and A675V Pfk13 mutations at low frequencies and with no reports of clinical treatment failure, except for Rwanda. These mutations present a threat to malaria control across the continent, since the greatest burden of malaria remains in Africa. A rise in the frequency of these mutations and their spread would reverse the gains made in the reduction of malaria over the last 20 years, given the lack of new antimalarial treatments in the event artemisinin-based combination therapies fail. The review highlights the frequency of Pfk13 propeller domain mutations across Africa, providing an up-to-date perspective of Pfk13 mutations, and appeals for an urgent and

TI  - Combining Argo and Satellite Data Using Model-Derived Covariances: Blue Maps
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue Maps aims to exploit the versatility of an ensemble data assimilation system to deliver gridded estimates of ocean temperature, salinity, and sea-level with the accuracy of an observation-based product. Weekly maps of ocean properties are produced on a 1/10 degrees, near-global grid by combining Argo profiles and satellite observations using ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI). EnOI is traditionally applied to ocean models for ocean forecasting or reanalysis, and usually uses an ensemble comprised of anomalies for only one spatiotemporal scale (e.g., mesoscale). Here, we implement EnOI using an ensemble that includes anomalies for multiple space- and time-scales: mesoscale, intraseasonal, seasonal, and interannual. The system produces high-quality analyses that produce mis-fits to observations that compare well to other observation-based products and ocean reanalyses. The accuracy of Blue Maps analyses is assessed by comparing background fields and analyses to observations, before and after each analysis is calculated. Blue Maps produces analyses of sea-level with accuracy of about 4 cm; and analyses of upper-ocean (deep) temperature and salinity with accuracy of about 0.45 (0.15) degrees and 0.1 (0.015) practical salinity units, respectively. We show that the system benefits from a diversity of ensemble members with multiple scales, with different types of ensemble members weighted accordingly in different dynamical regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the variability of time distribution and contribution of runoff from snowmelt under the influence of climate change in the Beheshtabad Watershed, Iran, using the snowmelt runoff Model (SRM) and twenty Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) for Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 (RCP 6.0) for Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Twenty CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the lowest (RCP 2.6), highest (RCP 8.5) and medium ( RCP 6.0) emissions scenarios for the future periods (2011-2030 and 2046-2065) were obtained using MarkSim (http://gismap.ciat.cgiar.org/MarkSimGCM). The results showed that annual average rainfall will decrease 16.15% and 22.94% and mean annual maximum and minimum temperature will increase 1.79 degrees C and 2.89 degrees C for two future periods under RCP 6.0. The SRM variables and parameters were prepared from the Shahrekord station, and snow cover areas (SCAs) were obtained by MODIS satellite images. After the calibration and validation of SRM model, the SRM model was then run with the future data under RCP 6.0. and revealed the effects of climate change on snowmelt runoff. The results show the displacement of the monthly peak flow from April to March, and reducing the contribution of snowmelt runoff from 27.2 to 23.2% and 20.13% for two future periods. The present study confirmed the effects of climate change on future climate data and discharge and temporal pattern of snowmelt runoff.

TI  - Monitoring the rapid changes in mangrove vegetation of coastal urban environment using polynomial trend analysis of temporal satellite data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, anthropogenic activities have triggered the rate of change in the function of mangrove ecosystems in coastal urban areas. Satellite imagery provides valuable information for mangrove mapping and monitoring. Metrics derived from the linear regression analysis of spectral indices (SIs) derived from satellites are commonly used for change analysis. This study examines the robustness of the widely used SIs derived from Landsat satellite image to distinguish mangroves and non-mangrove features and identify the non-linear changes over mangrove forest using the polynomial trend analysis. Airborne Visible and Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) data was resampled to simulate the spectral-response of the Landsat sensor. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mutual information (MI) were applied to the simulated data to identify the optimal SIs. Based on the statistical analysis, modular mangrove recognition index (MMRI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) were identified to delineate the mangrove, inundated and built-up region. Finally, time-series profiles of the identified spectral indices were generated using Landsat-8 (L8) and Landsat-7 (L7) data to analyse the change dynamics of the mangrove vegetation from 2002 to 2019. The proposed methodology was applied to study the changes in mangroves in the coastal areas of Kochi (Ernakulam District, Kerala State, India). The temporal-non-linear changes in the mangrove area were identified based on polynomial regression that revealed abrupt decline (42% decrease) in the mangrove area due to large-scale infrastructure development projects. The proposed approach is easy to implement, which enables the frequent monitoring of extensive mangrove forests. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Russian forest sequesters substantially more carbon than previously reported
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and transition to a new forest inventory system, Russia has reported almost no change in growing stock (+1.8%) and biomass (+0.6%). Yet remote sensing products indicate increased vegetation productivity, tree cover and above-ground biomass. Here, we challenge these statistics with a combination of recent National Forest Inventory and remote sensing data to provide an alternative estimate of the growing stock of Russian forests and to assess the relative changes in post-Soviet Russia. Our estimate for the year 2014 is 111 +/- 1.3x10(9) m(3), or 39% higher than the value in the State Forest Register. Using the last Soviet Union report as a reference, Russian forests have accumulated 1163x10(6) m(3) yr(-1) of growing stock between 1988-2014, which balances the net forest stock losses in tropical countries. Our estimate of the growing stock of managed forests is 94.2x10(9) m(3), which corresponds to sequestration of 354 Tg C yr(-1) in live biomass over 1988-2014, or 47% higher than reported in the National Greenhouse Gases Inventory.

TI  - Land use mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series in a heterogeneous landscape in Niger, Sahel
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use maps describe the spatial distribution of natural resources, cultural landscapes, and human settlements, serving as an important planning tool for decision makers. In the Sahel area, such information is valuable for risk management and mitigation in challenging sectors like food security, flood control, and urban planning. Due to its uniform quality across large areas in regular time steps, remote sensing imageries are essential input for producing land use maps. However, spatially and temporally heterogeneous landscapes in Sahel make classification of landscape features difficult. Our overall goal is to create an accurate, high resolution land use map covering Niamey, the capital of Niger and its surroundings which represents the unique landscape features in the Sahel using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 archives. We assessed the performance of three commonly used classifiers (i.e. Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for land use classification. To understand the utility of different features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for classification, we performed feature selection and compared mapping accuracies with and without feature selection. To leverage the strength of each classifier, we developed a classifier ensemble (CE) map based on the mapping accuracy of each land use class and each classifier. The results of this study showed that the performance of individual classifiers depends on feature selection method and accuracies can be improved by combining different classifiers. The ensemble map had an overall accuracy of 72 +/- 3.9% and it was found superior in terms of accuracy particularly with respect to built-up areas compared to the existing global land cover products in the study area. Our classification scheme also better characterized the regional environment in the Sahel. For example, we mapped rice and bare rocks that have important regional implication, which are not included in the existing products. Overall, our approach highlights the potentiality of combining multi-modal imageries and multiple classifiers for mapping a heterogenous environment such as the Sahel with high spatial resolution.

TI  - A new approach for estimating and delineating within-field crop water stress zones with satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As water scarcity and demand for food both grow, viable solutions to efficiently irrigate crops are needed. The recent advent of variable rate irrigation systems provides technology for growers to water their fields accounting for the spatially heterogeneous demand of their crops for water. Some zones within a field may require less or more water based on varying solar radiation, soil type, or surface or subsurface water flow paths. Since these processes are heterogeneous and complex, they are challenging to model or measure with the spatial resolution necessary to implement successful variable rate irrigation. In this paper, we present a new approach that uses high-resolution (20 to 100 m) satellite imagery obtained from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 to estimate zones of crop water stress. Our approach integrates two independent measures of crop water availability - Normalized Difference Water Index, and Evapotranspiration modelled using remotely sensed land surface temperature - with k-means clustering to delineate zones in an automated fashion. Our study area in southern Idaho has been set up experimentally to grow crops that are water-stressed and not water-stressed, thus providing a rigorous design to test and validate our method. The results of our method agree well with our independent suite of crop water stress measures, such as yield, variable irrigation rates, and matric potential. This method can be used to develop data-driven zones for variable rate irrigation, which has the potential to improve the efficiency of water use without sacrificing yield.

TI  - Suitability of satellite remote sensing data for yield estimation in northeast Germany
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information provided by satellite data is becoming increasingly important in the field of agriculture. Estimating biomass, nitrogen content or crop yield can improve farm management and optimize precision agriculture applications. A vast amount of data is made available both as map material and from space. However, it is up to the user to select the appropriate data for a particular problem. Without the appropriate knowledge, this may even entail an economic risk. This study therefore investigates the direct relationship between satellite data from six different optical sensors as well as different soil and relief parameters and yield data from cereal and canola recorded by the thresher in the field. A time series of 13 years is considered, with 947 yield data sets consisting of dense point data sets and 755 satellite images. To answer the question of how well the relationship between remote sensing data and yield is, the correlation coefficient r per field is calculated and interpreted in terms of crop type, phenology, and sensor characteristics. The correlation value r is particularly high when a field and its crop are spatially heterogeneous and when the correct phenological time of the crop is reached at the time of satellite imaging. Satellite images with higher resolution, such as RapidEye and Sentinel-2 performed better in comparison with lower resolution sensors of the Landsat series. The additional Red Edge spectral band also has advantage, especially for cereal yield estimation. The study concludes that there are high correlation values between yield data and satellite data, but several conditions must be met which are presented and discussed here.

TI  - Detecting subtle change from dense Landsat time series: Case studies of mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle disturbance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to abrupt changes caused by land cover conversion, subtle changes driven by a shift in the condition, structure, or other biological attributes of land often lead to minimal and slower alterations of the terrestrial surface. Accurate mapping and monitoring of subtle change are crucial for an early warning of long-term gradual change that may eventually result in land cover conversion. Freely accessible moderate-resolution datasets such as the Landsat archive have great potential to characterize subtle change by capturing low-magnitude spectral changes in long-term observations. However, past studies have reported limited success in accurately extracting subtle changes from satellite-based time series analysis. In this study, we introduce a supervised framework named 'PIDS' to detect subtle forest disturbance from a comprehensive Landsat data archive by leveraging disturbance-based calibration sites. PIDS consists of four components: (1) Parameter optimization; (2) Index selection; (3) Dynamic stratified monitoring; and (4) Spatial consideration. PIDS was applied to map the early stage of bark beetle infestations (i.e., a lower per-pixel fraction of trees cover that show visual signs of infestation), which are a typical example of subtle change in conifer forests. Landsat Analysis Ready Data were used as the time series inputs for mapping mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle disturbance between 2001 and 2019 in Colorado, USA. PIDS-detection map assessment showed that the overall performance of PIDS (namely 'F1 score') was 0.86 for mountain pine beetle and 0.73 for spruce beetle, making a substantial improvement (> 0.3) compared to other approaches/products including COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance, LandTrendr, and the National Land Cover Database forest disturbance product. A sub-pixel analysis of tree canopy mortality percentage was performed by linking classified high-resolution (0.3- and 1-m) aerial imagery and 30-m PIDSdetection maps. Results show that PIDS typically detects mountain pine beetle infestation when >56% of a Landsat pixel is occupied by red-stage canopy mortality (one year after initial infestation), and spruce beetle infestation when >55% is occupied by gray-stage mortality (two years after initial infestation). This study addresses an important methodological goal pertinent to the utility of event-based reference samples for detecting subtle forest change, which could be potentially applied to other types of subtle land change.

TI  - Dynamics of hydrological and geomorphological processes in evaporite karst at the eastern Dead Sea - a multidisciplinary study
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst groundwater systems are characterized by the presence of multiple porosity types. Of these, subsurface conduits that facilitate concentrated, heterogeneous flow are challenging to resolve geologically and geophysically. This is especially the case in evaporite karst systems, such as those present on the shores of the Dead Sea, where rapid geomorphological changes are linked to a fall in base level by over 35 m since 1967. Here we combine field observations, remote-sensing analysis, and multiple geophysical surveying methods (shear wave reflection seismics, electrical resistivity tomography, ERT, self-potential, SP, and groundpenetrating radar, GPR) to investigate the nature of subsurface groundwater flow and its interaction with hypersaline Dead Sea water on the rapidly retreating eastern shoreline, near Ghor Al-Haditha in Jordan. Remote-sensing data highlight links between the evolution of surface stream channels fed by groundwater springs and the development of surface subsidence patterns over a 25-year period. ERT and SP data from the head of one groundwater-fed channel adjacent to the former lakeshore show anomalies that point to concentrated, multidirectional water flow in conduits located in the shallow subsurface (< 25 m depth). ERT surveys further inland show anomalies that are coincident with the axis of a major depression and that we interpret as representing subsurface water flow. Low-frequency GPR surveys reveal the limit between unsaturated and saturated zones (< 30 m depth) surrounding the main depression area. Shear wave seismic reflection data nearly 1 km further inland reveal buried paleochannels within alluvial fan deposits, which we interpret as pathways for groundwater flow from the main wadi in the area towards the springs feeding the surface streams. Finally, simulations of density-driven flow of hypersaline and under- saturated groundwaters in response to base-level fall perform realistically if they include the generation of karst conduits near the shoreline. The combined approaches lead to a refined conceptual model of the hydrological and geomorphological processes developed at this part of the Dead Sea, whereby matrix flow through the superficial aquifer inland transitions to conduit flow nearer the shore where evaporite deposits are encountered. These conduits play a key role in the development of springs, stream channels and subsidence across the study area.

TI  - The variability of sea surface temperature in the Patagonian Shelf Argentina, from 35 years of satellite information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present work is to analyse the variations of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Anomaly of Sea Surface Temperature (ASST) using more than thirty years of satellite data. We studied if these variations have possible ocean-atmosphere connections with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) in a crucial region for fisheries off the Patagonian Shelf. For the analysis, we used SST data collected from 1985 to 2019 with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. The two databases were merged to obtain 35 years of continuous SST data. The study area was divided into three zones to present different oceanographic and bathymetric characteristics. These zones are located in the gulf, in the middle of the continental shelf, and at the shelf break. For each of the zones, the monthly SST climatology and the ASST series are shown. To define their periodicity, monthly ASST data were analysed spectrally by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform. Cross-Wavelet Transform (XWT) was applied to analyse the co-variance of ASST with respect to climate indices. Our results show that the isotherm distribution seems to be separated by the 64o W meridian. To the east of 64o W, it follows an oblique direction from southwest to northeast; to the west of 64o W, a more complex behaviour of the SST field seems to be associated with the coastal dynamics. The ASST series shows that the values of negative anomalies are higher than those of the positive ones. Nevertheless, positive ASSTs are more extreme and persistent in time than the negative ones. The ASST wavelet diagrams denote a common and non-stationary periodicity in the three zones, with statistically significant power spectra in the intra-seasonal (9-month) and inter-annual (24-month and 4-year) time scales. There are clearly common features in the wavelet power of the time series related to ASST and climate forcing. The SAM exhibited the closest relationship with ASST in the three zones. The SAM and ASST indices denote significant power peaks in the 2-year and 4- to 6-year bands.

TI  - Comparison of TOA and BOA LW Radiation Fluxes Inferred From Ground-Based Sensors, A-Train Satellite Observations and ERA Reanalyzes at the High Arctic Station Eureka Over the 2002-2020 Period
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the accuracy of longwave radiation flux retrievals at the top and bottom of the atmosphere at Eureka station, Canada, in the high Arctic. We report comparisons between seven products derived from (a) calculations based on a combination of ground-based and space-based lidar and radar observations, (b) standard radiometric observations from the CERES sensor, (c) direct observations at the surface from a broadband radiation station, and (d) the ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyzes. Statistical, independent analyses are first performed to look at recurring bias and trends in fluxes at Top and Bottom of the Atmosphere (TOA, BOA). The analysis is further refined by comparing fluxes derived from coincident observations decomposed by scene types. Results show that radiative transfer calculations using ground-based lidar-radar profiles derived at Eureka agree well with TOA LW fluxes observed by CERES and with BOA LW fluxes reference. CloudSat-CALIPSO also shows good agreement with calculations from ground-based sensor observations, with a relatively small bias. This bias is shown to be largely due to low and thick cloud occurrences that the satellites are insensitive to owing to attenuation from clouds above and surface clutter. These conditions of opaque low clouds, cause an even more pronounced bias for CERES BOA flux calculation in winter, due to the deficit of low clouds identified by MODIS. ERA-I and ERA5 fluxes behave differently, the large positive bias observed with ERA-I is much reduced in ERA5. ERA5 is closer to reference observations due to better behavior of low and mid-level clouds and surface temperature.

TI  - Trends of the contributions of biophysical (climate) and socioeconomic elements to regional heat islands
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of urban accumulations in recent decades has led to the transformation of urban heat islands (UHI) into regional heat islands (RHI). The contributions of the biophysical, climate, and socioeconomic factors to RHI in urban agglomeration remain poorly understood. Here Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) in eastern China has been selected as a case area to explore the influences trends, of the influencing factors to RHI by using MODIS data from 2003 to 2017. Results showed that, in summer, the area fraction of daytime RHI in YRDUA has increased from 21.74 to 31.03% in 2003 and 2017, respectively. As compared to 2003, the annual nighttime RHI area in 2017 has increased from 7510 to 20,097 km(2). The dominant factors of surface RHI intensity (SRHII) showed seasonal variation. Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (interpretation of 33.27%) was the dominant factor of daytime SRHII in spring. The most important factor was normalized difference build-up density (NDBI) (37.28% and 26.83%, respectively) in summer and autumn. In winter, precipitation (26.16%) was the most influential. At night, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) had a dominant effect on SRHII in spring (54.12%), autumn (52.62%), and winter (24.19%). The dominant factor of nighttime SRHII in summer was EVI (42%). Moreover, water bodies harm RHI during the day while having a positive effect at night. These findings can provide a theoretical basis for regional environment improvement and regional sustainable development.

TI  - Physician attitudes regarding the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Adult Immunization Schedule
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was created out of the need to formalize vaccine recommendations for the United States. Annually, ACIP delivers recommendations to the CDC director for guidance about United States vaccine use and publishes the Adult Immunization Schedule. Updated schedules feature changes to vaccine recommendations as well as changes to the schedule's usability for physicians. The objective of this study was to determine physicians' attitudes about the Adult Immunization Schedule. Surveys were administered to a sentinel physician network from October 2019 through January 2020. Physicians that responded were comfortable using the Adult Immunization Schedule, but reported confusion about some medical condition-based indications. Physicians reported a lack engagement with mobile applications, CDC Vaccine Schedules and Shots by STFM (the Society for Teachers of Family Medicine). Future work should focus on increasing clarity regarding the recommendations with medical condition-based indications and increasing knowledge of mobile applications for physicians.

TI  - Deep semantic segmentation for detecting eucalyptus planted forests in the Brazilian territory using sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to analyze the use of deep semantic segmentation to detect eucalyptus afforestation areas using Sentinel-2 images. The study compared six architectures (U-net, DeepLabv3+, FPN, MANet, PSPNet, LinkNet) with four encoders (ResNet-101, ResNeXt-101, Efficient-net-b3 and Efficient-net-b7), using 10 spectral bands. Even though the differences were not large among the different models, we found that the Efficient-net-b7 was the best backbone among all architectures, and the best overall model was DeepLabv3+ with the Efficient-net-b7 backbone, achieving an IoU of 76.57. Moreover, we compared the mapping of large satellite images with the sliding window technique with overlapping pixels considering six stride values. We found that sliding windows with lower stride values significantly minimized errors in the frame edge both visually and quantitively (metrics). Semantic segmentation allows an evident distinction between the afforestation and the natural vegetation, being fast and efficient for spatial distribution analysis of afforestation changes in Brazil.

TI  - Assessing effects of chronic heavy metal exposure through a multibiomarker approach: the case of <i>Liomys irroratus</i> (Rodentia: Heteromyidae)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild animals that inhabit inside mine tailings which contain heavy metals are an excellent study model to conduct ecotoxicological studies that analyze chronic metal exposures at low doses (realistic exposures). This study was conducted in Huautla, Morelos, Mexico, in a mining district where 780,000 tons of wastes were deposited in open air. Liomys irroratus is a small mammal species that lives inside these mine tailings. A multibiomarker approach study was performed to analyze metal bioaccumulation levels (biomarker of exposure) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, DNA damage levels (biomarker of early effects) through the alkaline comet assay, and population genetic structure and diversity (biomarker of permanent effects), using seven microsatellite loci, in 75 L. irroratus individuals, from two mine tailings and one reference site. Concentrations of aluminum, copper, iron, nickel, lead, and zinc were statistically higher in the liver of exposed individuals. Significant DNA damage levels were registered in the mine tailings groups. Aluminum, lead, and nickel had the highest contribution to the genetic damage levels observed, while aluminum and nickel had the highest contribution to genetic diversity effects. A positive and significant relationship was detected between individual genetic diversity (internal relatedness) and genetic damage (DNA single-strand breaks). Genetic structure of L. irroratus populations revealed that the main source of genetic variation was located within populations. We consider that multibiomarker studies in environmental settings using sentinel species are valuable for environmental risk assessment and ecological responses in chronic exposed populations.

TI  - Is preoperative axillary radio-cytology justified after ACOSOG Z001?
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction > invasive breast cancer without clinical adenopathy (cN0) is currently explored by the sentinel node (GS) technique, except in the case of positive preoperative radio-cytological screening, where oxillory curage (CA) remains systematic from the outset. Since the publication of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, abstention from CA is possible in patients presenting less than three metastatic GS. As a result, the value of oxillory radio-cytological screening is being questioned os it could potentially lead to oxillary surgical over-treatment. The objective of this study was to study clinically N0 patients with positive oxillory cytology and to compare it to a group of patients with positive GS.Method > One hundred and forty-seven patients with cN0 pN+ breast cancer treated between 2014 and 2016 were selected retrospectively. Two groups were constituted according to the initial radio-cytological evaluation. A CA was systematically performed.Results > Thirty-one patients with positive axillary cytology (n = 31 vs. n = 116) had more metastatic lymph nodes (P = 0.01) in the AC, larger (P < 0.001), less differentiated (P < 0.001) tumours, and shorter recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0114). It also appeared that 38.7 % of patients with a positive cytology hod at most two metastatic nodes and could, according to the results of ACOSOG, benefit from therapeutic de-escalation.Conclusion > X-ray cytological screening remains essential in order to select a subgroup of patients with o high lymph node tumour load. Additional studies are necessary in order to be able to offer therapeutic de-escalation to 1/3 of these patients without the risk of under-treatment for the remaining 2/3.

TI  - A cloud detection method for GaoFen-6 wide field of view imagery based on the spectrum and variance of superpixels
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wide Field of View (WFV) imaging system equipped on the GaoFen-6 (GF-6) optical remote sensing satellite can acquire an image with a swath width 800 km and a resolution of 16 m, which is the largest Earth observation swath width among similar satellites in the world. With the advantages of the high spatial resolution and the wide field of view, GF-6 WFV images are widely used in agricultural resources monitoring, forestry resources investigation, and disaster relief. However, the existence of clouds is inevitable problem in GF-6 WFV images, which influences their availability. To quickly and accurately detect cloud areas in GF-6 WFV images, a cloud detection method for GF-6 WFV images based on the spectrum and variance of superpixels is proposed in the paper. First, the GF-6 WFV image is down-sampled. The simple linear iterative clustering algorithm is used to segment down-sampled images to obtain superpixels. The initial cloud detection result is obtained based on the spectrum of superpixels. Second, the initial cloud detection result is refined based on the variance of superpixels to eliminate the influence of cloud-like ground objects. Finally, the refined cloud detection result is post-processed using the region growing algorithm and expansion algorithm. The post-processed cloud detection result is up-sampled to obtain cloud detection result of the GF-6 WFV image. The experimental results show that the recall and precision of the proposed method are 84.61% and 88.46%, respectively, providing good cloud detection results for GF-6 WFV images.

TI  - Using remote sensing to identify soil types based on multiscale image texture features
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatial distribution of soil types is an important academic and practical issue in agriculture. With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, the role of image texture as an auxiliary variable in remote sensing identification of objects has increased. It is of great importance to ascertain the optimal window size for extracting texture features and the multiscale fusion of texture feature parameters under the optimal window for different soil types. To reach this goal, soil types in a typical area of the Jiaodong Peninsula were selected as the subject investigated, homogeneity and entropy were selected as the two texture feature parameters, and the ability to identify the different soil types based on the textural features was systematically analyzed by using Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Moreover, the optimal window sizes for extracting texture features were determined, and the role of multiscale textural features in the classification of the soil types was also evaluated. The results show that the accuracy of classification significantly increased with the addition of textural features. The optimal single-scale window sizes for the homogeneity and entropy feature parameters were 19 x 19 and 21 x 21, respectively. The fusion of multiscale textural features further improved the classification accuracy. The optimal multiscale window sizes for the homogeneity were 7 x 7, 13 x 13, 19 x 19 and 21 x 21 and those for entropy were 5 x 5, 15 x 15, 21 x 21 and 23 x 23. Therefore, the method of using texture information in remote sensing images as auxiliary variables in digital soil mapping was feasible. The method of multiscale fusion of texture features, which resulted in greater classification accuracy, was better than that of single-scale window. These conclusions could play an important guiding role in soil digital mapping with remote sensing.

TI  - Determining the critical geographical directions of sand and dust storms in urban areas by remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand and dust storms (SDS) are common events in arid and semi-arid regions. This study aims to determine the critical geographical directions of SDS in urban areas with a case study in the city of Gonabad in the northeast of Iran. For this purpose, a frequency analysis was performed based on horizontal visibility, wind direction, and vegetation cover using remote sensing images. In addition, the Sand and Dust Storm Direction Index (SDSDI) was introduced which is the ratio of the SDS frequency to wind frequency for each geographical direction. The results showed that the main activity of the SDS occurred from April to September in the southeast direction in the study area. The results confirmed the impact of vegetation cover on the occurrence of the SDS, but in extreme events cannot control it alone. The frequency of SDS in the study area is closely related to the cyclonic and cold front activity. The SDSDI has determined the critical geographical directions of the SDS. This indicator can show critical directions for wind erosion. Therefore, controlling and non-desertification measures can focus on them.

TI  - Multi-polarization C-band SAR imagery to quantify damage levels due to the Central Italy earthquake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the ability of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) measurements to quantify post-earthquake damages. To achieve this goal, a twofold task is addressed: on one side a processing chain, which exploits multi-polarization SAR features, and a decision-tree classifier is proposed to quantify the levels of damage in earthquake-affected urbanized areas using dual-polarimetric (DP) SAR imagery. On the other side, a new damage index is developed that allows a fair spatial inter-comparison of building-by-building information, collected via ground surveys on the damaged areas, and SAR-derived damage maps. The proposed rationale is showcased using measurements related to the Central-Italy Earthquake occurred in 2016 where both Sentinel-1 DP imagery and ground-based information are available. Experimental results demonstrate the soundness of the proposed approach. The main outcomes can be summarized as follows: a) DP features perform better than single-polarization ones; b) DP features exhibit a larger sensitivity to lower damage grades if compared to the single polarization (SP) feature; c) the accuracy of the estimated damage levels depends on the requested granularity in the damage maps; d) the accuracy obtained using DP features spans from similar to 52% up to similar to 71% when five and two damage classes are considered, respectively.

TI  - Remote Sensing Phenology of Antarctic Green and Red Snow Algae Using WorldView Satellites
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow algae are an important group of terrestrial photosynthetic organisms in Antarctica, where they mostly grow in low lying coastal snow fields. Reliable observations of Antarctic snow algae are difficult owing to the transient nature of their blooms and the logistics involved to travel and work there. Previous studies have used Sentinel 2 satellite imagery to detect and monitor snow algal blooms remotely, but were limited by the coarse spatial resolution and difficulties detecting red blooms. Here, for the first time, we use high-resolution WorldView multispectral satellite imagery to study Antarctic snow algal blooms in detail, tracking the growth of red and green blooms throughout the summer. Our remote sensing approach was developed alongside two Antarctic field seasons, where field spectroscopy was used to build a detection model capable of estimating cell density. Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging of blooms and in situ life cycle analysis was used to validate and verify our model output. WorldView imagery was then used successfully to identify red and green snow algae on Anchorage Island (Ryder Bay, 67 degrees S), estimating peak coverage to be 9.48 x 10(4) and 6.26 x 10(4) m(2), respectively. Combined, this was greater than terrestrial vegetation area coverage for the island, measured using a normalized difference vegetation index. Green snow algae had greater cell density and average layer thickness than red blooms (6.0 x 10(4) vs. 4.3 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) and so for Anchorage Island we estimated that green algae dry biomass was over three times that of red algae (567 vs. 180 kg, respectively). Because the high spatial resolution of the WorldView imagery and its ability to detect red blooms, calculated snow algal area was 17.5 times greater than estimated with Sentinel 2 imagery. This highlights a scaling problem of using coarse resolution imagery and suggests snow algal contribution to net primary productivity on Antarctica may be far greater than previously recognized.

TI  - The RapeseedMap10 database: annual maps of rapeseed at a spatial resolution of 10m based on multi-source data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Large-scale, high-resolution maps of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), a major oilseed crop, are critical for predicting annual production and ensuring global energy security, but such maps are still not freely available for many areas. In this study, we developed a new pixel- and phenology-based algorithm and produced a new data product for rapeseed planting areas (2017-2019) in 33 countries at 10m spatial resolution based on multiple data. Our product is strongly consistent at the national level with official statistics of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Our rapeseed maps achieved F1 spatial consistency scores of at least 0.81 when compared with the Cropland Data Layer in the United States, the Annual Crop Inventory in Canada, the Crop Map of England, and the Land Cover Map of France. Moreover, F1 scores based on independent validation samples ranged from 0.84 to 0.91, implying a good consistency with ground truth. In almost all countries covered in this study, the rapeseed crop rotation interval was at least 2 years. Our derived maps suggest, with reasonable accuracy, the robustness of the algorithm in identifying rapeseed over large regions with various climates and landscapes. Scientists and local growers can use the freely downloadable derived rapeseed planting areas to help predict rapeseed production and optimize planting structures. The product is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.17632/ydf3m7pd4j.3 (Han et al., 2021).

TI  - Evaluation of Novel NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Aerosol Products and Assessment of Smoke Height Boundary Layer Ratio During Extreme Smoke Events in the Western USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze new aerosol products from NASA satellite retrievals over the western USA during August 2013, with special attention to locally generated wildfire smoke and downwind plume structures. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Terra and Aqua Collections 6 and 6.1) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Deep Blue (DB) and MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) retrievals are evaluated against ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations. We find a significant improvement in correlation with AERONET and other metrics in the latest DB AOD (MODIS C6.1 r(2) = 0.75, VIIRS r(2) = 0.79) compared to MODIS C6 (r(2) = 0.62). In general, MAIAC (r(2) = 0.84) and DB (MODIS C6.1 and VIIRS) present similar statistical evaluation metrics for the western USA and are useful tools to characterize aerosol loading associated with wildfire smoke. We also evaluate three novel NASA MODIS plume injection height (PIH) products, one from MAIAC and two from the Aerosol Single scattering albedo and layer Height Estimation (ASHE) (MODIS and VIIRS) algorithm. Both Terra and Aqua MAIAC PIHs statistically agree with ground-based and satellite lidar observations near the fire source, as do ASHE, although the latter is sensitive to assumptions about aerosol absorption properties. We introduce a first-order approximation Smoke Height Boundary Layer Ratio (SHBLR) to qualitatively distinguish between aerosol pollution within the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere. We summarize the scope, limitations, and suggestions for scientific applications of surface level aerosol concentrations specific to wildfire emissions and smoke plumes using these novel NASA MODIS and VIIRS aerosol products.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of wetlands in the northern Xinjiang with relationship to climate change
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in arid region especially in the northern Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China (NXC) are sensitive to climate change and thus have been the focus of global change studies in terms of their ecological importance. However, spatial changes in wetland area drivers are rarely considered in the analytical driver literature. This is surprising given the importance spatial heterogeneity in geomorphology and climatic conditions have in the region. This study is aimed at investigating the characteristics of wetland dynamic and determine whether this changes are relating to drought variation in NXC for a long time scale (from 1980 to 2015). Land transition matrix analysis was used to illustrate the Transition Characteristics between wetland and other land-use types, and the standard precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was calculated to investigate the changes of Dry-wet regime in NXC and assess the effects on wetlands. The results showed that wetlands area increased from 10,627.57 km(2) to 11,966.84 km(2) mainly caused by the conversion from grasslands and desert to wetlands during 1980-2015 in NXC. Simultaneously, SPEI showed an increasing trend during 1960-2015, indicating an alleviating tendency of drought intensity. The area of wetlands increased with the increase of SPEI, furthermore, the correlation analysis also indicated that climatic change, especially a warmer and more humid tendency, was the main factor driving the spatiotemporal changes of wetlands in NXC. These findings can contribute to a better understanding wetland changes and implementing wetland resource management and restoration.

TI  - Flood hazard mapping for data-scarce and ungauged coastal river basins using advanced hydrodynamic models, high temporal-spatial resolution remote sensing precipitation data, and satellite imageries
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an integrated approach to simulate flooding and inundation for small- and medium-sized coastal river basins where measured data are not available or scarce. By coupling the rainfall-runoff model, the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, and the integration of these with global tide model, satellite precipitation products, and synthetic aperture radar imageries, a comprehensive flood modeling system for Tra Bong river basin selected as a case study was set up and operated. Particularly, in this study, the lumped conceptual model was transformed into the semi-distributed model to increase the parameter sets of donor basins for applying the physical similarity approach. The temporal downscaling technique was applied to disaggregate daily rainfall data using satellite-based precipitation products. To select an appropriate satellite-derived rainfall product, two high temporal-spatial resolution products (0.1 x 0.1 degrees and 1 h) including GSMaP_GNRT6 and CMORPH_CRT were examined at 1-day and 1-h resolutions by comparing with ground-measured rainfall. The CMORPH_CRT product showed better performance in terms of statistical errors such as Correlation Coefficient, Probability of Detection, False Alarm Ratio, and Critical Success Index. Land cover/land use, flood extent, and flood depths derived from Sentinel-1A imageries and a digital elevation model were employed to determine the surface roughness and validate the flood modeling. The results obtained from the modeling system were found to be in good agreement with collected data in terms of NSE (0.3-0.8), RMSE (0.19-0.94), RPE (- 213 to 0.7%), F1 (0.55), and F2 (0.37). Subsequently, various scenarios of flood frequency with 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year return periods under the probability analysis of extreme values were developed to create the flood hazard maps for the study area. The flood hazards were then investigated based on the flood intensity classification of depth, duration, and velocity. These hazard maps are significantly important for flood hazard assessments or flood risk assessments. This study demonstrated that applying advanced hydrodynamic models on computing flood inundation and flood hazard analysis in data-scarce and ungauged coastal river basins is completely feasible. This study provides an approach that can be used also for other ungauged river basins to better understand flooding and inundation through flood hazard mapping.

TI  - Multi-dimensional assessment of watershed condition using a newly developed barometer of sustainability
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was conducted to comprehensively evaluate watershed sustainability with the help of an initiative barometer developed based on different dimensions of social, economic, environmental, and policy. The newly developed barometer was then applied to assess the temporal variation of sustainability for the Shazand Watershed, Iran, for four-node years of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2016. The appropriate criteria were then adapted to calculate the study dimensions. The effect sizes of selected criteria on each dimension were also determined. Consequently, the status of each dimension and integrated watershed sustainability status were mapped for four-node years. The results indicated that study dimensions were unevenly distributed over the Shazand Watershed. So that, the social dimension had high effectiveness across different sub-watersheds, and the policy dimension had a poor situation in all study years. In addition, the respective sustainability index of 0.32, 0.32, 0.35, and 0.35 for node years of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2016 verified a slight improvement. Overall, the proposed barometer of sustainability facilitated understanding the dimensional sustainability and comprehensive watershed sustain ability and provided references for policy formulations and watershed management. Besides, the developed barometer has a high potential for evaluating sustainability for other watersheds worldwide. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seroprevalence of human coronaviruses among patients visiting hospital-based sentinel sites in Uganda
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHuman coronaviruses are causative agents of respiratory infections with several subtypes being prevalent worldwide. They cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity and have been described to be continuously emerging but their prevalence is not well documented in Uganda. This study assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies against the previously known human coronaviruses prior 2019 in Uganda.MethodsA total 377 serum samples collected from volunteers that showed influenza like illness in five hospital-based sentinel sites and archived were analyzed using a commercial Qualitative Human Coronavirus Antibody IgG ELISA kit. Although there is no single kit available that can detect the presence of all the circulating coronaviruses, this kit uses a nucleoprotein, aa 340-390 to coat the wells and since there is significant homology among the various human coronavirus strains with regards to the coded for proteins, there is significant cross reactivity beyond HCoV HKU-39849 2003. This gives the kit a qualitative ability to detect the presence of human coronavirus antibodies in a sample.ResultsThe overall seroprevalence for all the sites was 87.53% with no significant difference in the seroprevalence between the Hospital based sentinel sites (p=0.8). Of the seropositive, the age group 1-5years had the highest percentage (46.97), followed by 6-10years (16.67) and then above 20 (16.36). An odds ratio of 1.6 (CI 0.863-2.97, p=0.136) showed that those volunteers below 5years of age were more likely to be seropositive compared to those above 5years. The seropositivity was generally high throughout the year with highest being recorded in March and the lowest in February and December.ConclusionsThe seroprevalence of Human coronaviruses is alarmingly high which calls for need to identify and characterize the circulating coronavirus strains so as to guide policy on the control strategies.

TI  - Assessing the land degradation and greening response to changes in hydro-climatic variables using a conceptual framework: A case-study in central India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-based investigations of land use/cover changes are time-consuming and challenging for large areas, where short- and long-term changes in climatic and hydrologic variables affect ecosystem services. Thus, there is a substantial demand to boost the new modelling framework and employ remote sensing capabilities to quantify hydro-climatic impacts on land dynamics. In this study, a conceptual framework has used to assess the climatic land greening, climatic land degradation, nonclimatic (hydrological) land greening, and nonclimatic (anthropogenic) land degradation responses with hydro-climatic variables under dry and wet spells' effect in the Betwa River basin (BRB) of central India. Remotely sensed moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] and land cover) time-series datasets had been used to quantify spatiotemporal changes in major land use/cover classes. The standardized coefficients for rainfall (beta = 0.62) and relative humidity (beta = 0.32) showed their high relative importance in the relationship analysis performed using multiple linear regression (MLR). The result indicates that dominant agricultural cropland has been significantly impacted by changes in maximum and diurnal temperature, which affirm degradation, and positively responded by changes in rainfall, minimum temperature, and aridity index, which demonstrate greening wet period. Spatial analysis showed that land degradation affecting ecosystem services had been variedly distributed from the upper to lower basin due to more climatic impacts than anthropogenic disturbances. Thus, the developed conceptual framework can be adopted to discover dynamic land consequences and understand their responses for sustaining ecosystem services in the dominant agricultural region.

TI  - An innovative extraction methodology of active deformation areas based on sentinel-1 SAR dataset: the catalonia case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) has been proved to be an advanced Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique used to measure and monitor terrain deformation. Two of the critical problems with InSAR have been the effect of the refractive atmosphere and decorrelation on the interferometric phases due to long spatial-temporal baseline. The low density of persistent scatterers (PS) in non-urban areas affected by spatial-temporal decoherence more seriously has inspired the development of alternative approaches. Sentinel-1 (S1) has improved the data acquisition throughout, and compared to previous sensors, increased considerably the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) and PSI deformation monitoring potential. This paper describes an innovative methodology to process S1 SAR data. Different with PSI, its most original part includes two key processing stages: high and low frequency splitting from wrapped phases, prior to atmospheric filtering, and final direct integration to generate the complete deformation with time series containing linear and nonlinear components. The proposed method has two fundamental advantages compared with traditional PSI approach: the final monitoring results with excellent coverage of coherent points and the generation of active maps even for the areas with serious deformation in short term to break through the inherent limitation of PSI. The effectiveness of the proposed tools is illustrated using a case study located in Catalonia (Spain). This methodology has supposed a definitive step towards the implementation of DInSAR based techniques to support decision makers against geohazards. In this work, the deformation procedures happened in three different areas of the Catalonia (Spain) are presented and analysed. The maximum accumulated subsidence of over - 60 cm induced by mining activity can be detected by proposed methodology with nice coverage from January 2017 to January 2019. These reported cases illustrate how DInSAR based techniques can provide detailed terrain deformation for geohazard activity with complex topographical conditions. The active deformation areas map can be generated in fast aimed at geohazard risk early warning and management.

We used a qualitative methodology under a constructivist philosophical worldview and an ethnography research design. Data was collected through observation records, adolescents self-assessment and key actors' observations. The results revealed evident improvements in the behaviours and attitudes of the adolescents, both in the Physical Education class and in their daily lives, confirming the adequacy and effectiveness of that teaching model to improve the detained adolescents' behaviours, through physical education.

TI  - SIRT7: a sentinel of genome stability
T2  - OPEN BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - SIRT7 is a class III histone deacetylase that belongs to the sirtuin family. The past two decades have seen numerous breakthroughs in terms of understanding SIRT7 biological function. We now know that this enzyme is involved in diverse cellular processes, ranging from gene regulation to genome stability, ageing and tumorigenesis. Genomic instability is one hallmark of cancer and ageing; it occurs as a result of excessive DNA damage. To counteract such instability, cells have evolved a sophisticated regulated DNA damage response mechanism that restores normal gene function. SIRT7 seems to have a critical role in this response, and it is recruited to sites of DNA damage where it recruits downstream repair factors and directs chromatin regulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of SIRT7 in DNA repair and maintaining genome stability. We pay particular attention to the implications of SIRT7 function in cancer and ageing.

TI  - Using compositional mixed-effects models to evaluate responses to amino acid supplementation in milk replacers for calves
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of supplementing Lys, Met, and Thr in milk replacers (MR) for calves have been widely studied, but scarce information exists about potential roles of other AA (whether essential or not). The effects on growth performance of supplementation of 4 different AA combinations in a mixed ration (25.4% crude protein and 20.3% fat) based on skim milk powder and whey protein concentrate were evaluated in 76 Holstein male calves (3 +/- 1.7 d old). The 4 MR were as follows: CTRL with no AA supplementation; PG, supplying additional 0.3% Pro and 0.1% Gly; FY, supplying additional 0.2% Phe and 0.2% Tyr; and KMT, providing additional 0.62% Lys, 0.22% Met, and 0.61% Thr. All calves were fed the same milk allowance program and were weaned at 56 d of study. Concentrate intake was limited to minimize interference of potential differences in solid feed intake among treatments. Animals were weighed weekly, intakes recorded daily, and blood samples obtained at 2, 5, and 7 wk of study to determine serum urea and plasma AA concentrations. Plasma AA concentrations were explored using compositional data analysis, and their isometric log-ratio transformations were used to analyze their potential influence on ADG and serum urea concentration using a linear mixed-effects model. We detected no differences in calf performance and feed intake. Plasma relative concentration of the AA supplemented in the KMT and PG treatments increased in their respective treatments, and, in PG calves, a slight increase in the proportion of plasma Gly, Glu, and branched-chain AA was also observed. The proportions of plasma branched-chain AA, His, and Gln increased, and those of Thr, Arg, Lys, and Glu decreased with calves' age. A specific log-contrast balance formed by Arg, Thr, and Lys was found to be the main driver for lowering serum urea concentrations and increasing calf growth. The use of compositional mixed-effects models identified a cluster formed by the combination of Arg, Thr, and Lys, as a potential AA to optimize calf growth.

TI  - Seasonality in Saharan Dust Across the Atlantic Ocean: From Atmospheric Transport to Seafloor Deposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Saharan dust is transported in great quantities from the North African continent every year, most of which is deposited across the North Atlantic Ocean. This dust impacts regional and global climate by affecting the atmospheric radiation balance and altering ocean carbon budgets. However, little research has been carried out on time series of Saharan dust collected in situ across the open Atlantic. Here, we present a unique three-year time series of Saharan dust along a trans-Atlantic transect, sampled by moored surface buoys and subsurface sediment traps. Results show a good correlation between the particle-size distributions of atmospheric dust and the lithogenic particles settling to the deep ocean floor, confirming the aeolian origin of the lithogenic particles intercepted by the subsurface sediment traps, even in the distal western part of the Atlantic Ocean. Dust from both dry and wet deposition as collected by the sediment traps, shows increased deposition fluxes and coarser grain size in summer and/or autumn that coincides with increased precipitation at the sampling sites as derived from satellite data. In contrast, both buoys that sampled dust during transport at sea level show little seasonal variation in both concentration and particle size, as the large amounts of dust transported in summer and early autumn at high altitudes are far above their sampling range. This implies that wet deposition in summer and autumn defines the typical seasonal trends of both the dust deposition flux and its particle-size distribution observed in the sediment traps.

TI  - Super-resolution of remotely sensed data using channel attention based deep learning approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing image super-resolution aims to improve the spectral and/or spatial resolution of the satellite imageries. In order to improve the performance of the CNN-based super-resolution methods, increasing the depth of the network is commonly used. However, this increases computational complexity and training difficulties only with small improvement of the performance. Meanwhile, the CNN kernels treat all the channels equally and cannot take the advantage of the abundant high-frequency information contained in the low-resolution images. To address these problems, Channel attention is one of the mechanisms and has been proven to be useful in many tasks. In this research, we proposed a channel attention-based framework for Remote Sensing Image Super-resolution (CARS) by constructing a novel residual channel attention block (RCAB) to further extract the features. In addition, a densely residual channel attention block (RCAB+) and densely residual spatial attention block (RSAB) were proposed to improve the performance. We adopted a post-upsampling architecture to reduce the computational complexity and time cost. Moreover, transfer learning strategy (CARS+T) was introduced to further improve the SR performance and proved to generate finer edge details. Experimentally, our proposed CARS, CARS_SA and CARS+T achieved competitive quantitative and qualitative results both on Data Fusion Contest Dataset and Pleiades Dataset that we created.

TI  - Quantifying uncertainties in nighttime light retrievals from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Day/Night Band data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of nighttime lights (NTL) from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Day/Night Band data have been widely used to estimate human activities. Long-term changes such as urban development and abrupt short-term changes such as power outages have been monitored from temporal NTL acquired by satellites. While high temporal NTL variation has been found across NTL data of varying temporal scale (e.g., daily, monthly, and annual composites), the sources of measurement error and uncertainty are poorly understood. This paper quantifies the sources of VIIRS-derived NTL uncertainty due to view-illumination geometry, surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo, and the effects of snow cover, lunar irradiance, aerosol loading, cloud mask, vegetation, geometry, and ephemeral artifacts (e.g., the Aurora Borealis). Based on this current assessment of NASA Black Marble retrievals (VNP46, Collection V001), we found that angular and atmospheric effects dominate retrieval uncertainty. Errors introduced by upstream data inputs (e.g., a coarser nighttime snow cover flag and misclassification errors in the existing VIIRS nighttime cloud mask) were also found to impact retrieval quality. Despite these challenges, a consistent daily NTL time series record can be routinely generated from top-of-atmosphere VNP46 radiances. Key recommendations include: (1) the use of lunar-BRDF adjusted and atmospherically corrected NTL (i.e., as identified as high-quality retrievals in the VNP46 QA fields), (2) development and improvement to the VIIRS snow cover and cloud masks algorithms to accurately reflect NTL retrieval conditions, (3) characterizing seasonal variations in NTL due to vegetation and snow, (4) reducing geometric effects due to the spatial mismatch of gridded pixel and observation footprint, (5) employing angularly-consistent NTL observations from multiple VIIRS instruments (i.e., Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20) to reduce pixel-based uncertainties and address persistent data gaps, and (6) being mindful of surface-reflected radiance from aurora events at mid-to-high latitudes.

TI  - Associations of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and physical activity with insomnia in Chinese adults
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Air pollution is a potential environmental risk for sleep disturbance. However, the evidence is very limited in China. On the other hand, physical activity (PA) is a preventive behavior that can improve insomnia, but whether PA mitigates the negative impact of air pollution on insomnia is unknown.Methods: We obtained data from the baseline of China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) survey, and examined the association between air pollution and insomnia, as well as PA's modification effect of on this association. We included 70,668 respondents and assessed insomnia by self-reported symptoms collected using electronic questionnaires. Using satellite data, we estimated the residence-specified, three-year average PM1, PM2.5. PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of <= 1 mu m, 52.5 mu m and 10 mu n, respectively), O-3 (ozone), and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) concentrations. We established the associations between air pollutants and insomnia through logistic regression. We evaluated the modification impact of total and domain-specific PA (leisure, occupation, housework, transportation) by introducing an interaction term.Results: Positive associations were observed between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5, PM10, and O-3 and insomnia symptoms, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.09 (1.03-1.16), 1.11 (1.07-1.15), 1.07 (1.05-1.10) and 1.15 (1.11-1.20), respectively. As total PA increased, the ORs of air pollution for insomnia tended to decrease and then rise. We observed varying modification effects of domain-specific PA. With an increase in leisure PA, the ORs for PM2.5 and PlA w significantly declined. However, increased ORs of air pollutants were related to insomnia among participants with higher levels of occupational and housework PA.Conclusion: Long-term exposure to higher concentrations of PM1, PM2.5, PM10, and O-3 increases the risk of insomnia symptoms. Moderate to high levels of leisure PA alleviate the harmful effects of air pollution on insomnia, while high levels of occupation and housework PA intensify such effects. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A novel re-compositing approach to create continuous and consistent cross-sensor/cross-production global NDVI datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The longest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series produced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has ended in 2017. At some point in the near future, all AVHRR sensors will be retired. To maintain continuity and consistency of this global data set, it is imperative to extend NDVI from other sensors, especially the operational Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which planned to maintain continuity at least through 2038. NDVI could be de-composited into two components: (1) the multi-year climatology and (2) the vegetation condition index (VCI). The former contains climate information and a majority of sensor noise, and the latter contains weather information and residual sensor noise. With the assumption that VCI from different sensors are similar, we re-composited the cross-sensor/cross-production NDVI with original VCI and the cross-sensor/cross-production climatology, and compared various cross-converted datasets with the three base NDVI datasets: two NDVI productions derived from AVHRR observation and another from VIIRS observation. As a result, the re-composited NDVI agrees well with the target base NDVI spatially and temporally, with an accuracy of 0.02 NDVI unit at a global scale. The comparison with several regression approaches distinguish the superiority of the new re-compositing approach.

TI  - Intercalibration of FY-3C MWRI Over Forest Warm-Scenes Based on Microwave Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to cover the warm end of Earth-scene brightness temperature (TB) range of passive microwave radiometers, intercalibration over warm scenes is necessary. This article presents a methodology to intercalibrate the microwave radiation imager (MWRI) on the Chinese second-generation meteorological satellite Fengyun 3C (FY-3C) with the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) over the warm scenes of dense forests using the double-difference (DD) method. Based on the microwave radiative transfer model (RTM), an intercalibration method is developed, in which a modified land surface emissivity (LSE) model for dense forests is proposed. The forests with optically thick canopy are identified in terms of polarization TB differences and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extracted from the latest vegetation product of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The matching TBs between FY-3C MWRI and GMI over dense forest warm scenes are collected and analyzed together with the TBs over ocean surfaces obtained by Zeng and Jiang (2020). The results show that: 1) FY-3C MWRI's observations are generally underestimated, and the intercalibration biases are polynomial functions of observations; 2) the intercalibration biases at the warm end are relatively smaller than those at the cold end; and 3) the calibration in the ascending orbits (MWRIA) is relatively better than that in the descending orbits (MWRID). At the tropical rain forest scene TBs defined in this work, the intercalibration biases (mean +/- standard deviation at the mean) in the FY-3C MWRI channels of 10 V, 10 H, 18 V, 18 H, 23 V, 36 V, 36 H, 89 V, and 89 H are, respectively, -1.3 +/- 0.7, -1.9 +/- 1.1, 1.6 +/- 0.6, 2.5 +/- 0.8, -0.2 +/- 0.5, -2.0 +/- 0.6, -2.4 +/- 0.7, -0.2 +/- 0.6, and -0.1 +/- 0.6 K for the ascending orbits, while they are, respectively, -4.0 +/- 0.8, -5.4 +/- 1.2, -1.4 +/- 0.7, -1.2 +/- 0.8, -2.9 +/- 0.5, -4.9 +/- 0.7, -5.5 +/- 0.7, -2.7 +/- 0.8, and -2.3 +/- 0.7 K for the descending orbits. The in-orbit calibration coefficients of GMI are successfully transferred to FY-3C MWRI.

TI  - Imaging the Hydrothermal System of Kirishima Volcanic Complex With L-Band InSAR Time Series
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present deformation measurements of the Kirishima volcanic complex from ALOS and ALOS-2 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series during 2006-2019. Shinmoe-dake deflated similar to 6 cm during the 2008-2010 phreatic eruptions and inflated similar to 5 cm prior to the 2017 magmatic eruption. Iwo-yama inflated similar to 19 cm within the crater since January 2015 and similar to 7 cm around the southern and western vents since 4 months before the 2018 eruption. These deformations can be modeled as ellipsoids at similar to 700 m depth beneath Shinmoe-dake and as a sphere on top of an ellipsoid at similar to 130 and similar to 340 m depths beneath Iwo-yama. Combining geodetic, geoelectric, geochemical, and petrological analysis, we interpret the hydrothermal origin of the deflation at Shinmoe-dake and inflation at Iwo-yama; the hydrothermal-magmatic transition during the 2011 Shinmoe-dake eruption; and water-boiling and bottom-up pressurization as driving mechanisms of the inflation at Iwo-yama. The study highlights the imaging potential of InSAR time series on complex hydrothermal systems.Plain Language Summary Steam-blast eruptions are driven by the heat of magma interacting with water. Although small in size, they are very common and unpredictable, making them hazardous. In order to know when and where these interactions started and how they led to the eruption, we take the Kirishima volcano group as an example and use 10 years of satellite radar images to measure its ground surface deformation. We find that Shinmoe-dake fell similar to 6 cm during the 2008-2010 eruptions, much earlier than previously thought; while Iwo-yama rose similar to 7 cm since 4 months before its 2018 eruption. Combining models from specialized computer code with previous studies from other disciplines, we explain that the fall of Shinmoe-dake and the rise of Iwo-yama are due to the steam release and water accumulation of water-rich zones at similar to 700 and similar to 340 m depth below the surface, respectively. The water-rich zone of Shinmoe-dake was replaced and filled by magma during the 2011 eruption. These short-lived, small-size deformations have not been identified in the region before nor has the type of deformation in general been studied extensively worldwide. Future volcano monitoring efforts should take this into account on a regular basis.

TI  - Risk Factors of Central Lymph Node Metastasis in Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma and the Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The present study aims to investigate the risk factors of central lymph node metastasis (CNM) in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) and evaluate the predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) during surgery. Methods: The clinicopathological data of 179 patients with PTMC staging in cN0 and with SLNB performed were analyzed retrospectively. Positive sentinel lymph node ratio (PSLNR) and additional positive lymph node (APLN) were analyzed in cases with positive SLNB. The efficiency of SLNB was investigated. ROC curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive value of PSLNR for APLN. Results: Cumulative maximum diameter of tumors (CMD) (P = 0.041) and capsule involvement (CI) (P = 0.014) were independent risk factors for central lymph node metastasis. The SLNB success rate was 97.28%, and the incidence of CNM was 31.28%. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLNB to evaluate CNM and APLN were 82.14 vs. 61.54%, 100 vs. 80.39%, 0 vs. 19.61%, 17.86 vs. 38.46%, 100 vs. 34.78%, and 92.48 vs. 92.48%, respectively. For cases with positive SLNB, subgroup analysis was performed according to APLN. The PSLNRs of true and false positive groups were 0.4620 +/- 0.1744 and 0.2425 +/- 0.1355, respectively (P < 0.001). Analyzing the predictive value of PSLNR by the ROC curve, the optimal diagnostic cutoff point was 0.2917 [AUC = 0.861 (95% CI: 0.757, 0.966), P < 0.001], and the sensitivity, specificity, FPR, FNR, PPV, and NPV of PSLNR were 87.50, 73.33, 26.67, 12.50, 63.64, and 91.67%, respectively. Conclusion: CMD and CI are independent risk factors for central lymph node metastasis in PTMC. SLNB has good predictive value for CNM. For cases with positive SLNB, PSLNR could be used to predict the presence of APLN, which may provide a theoretical basis for intraoperative lymph node dissection.

TI  - In-depth proteomics analysis of sentinel lymph nodes from individuals with endometrial cancer
T2  - CELL REPORTS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological cancers worldwide. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status could be a major prognostic factor in evaluation of EC, but several prospective studies need to be performed. Here we report an in-depth proteomics analysis showing significant variations in the SLN protein landscape in EC. We show that SLNs are correlated to each tumor grade, which strengthens evidence of SLN involvement in EC. A few proteins are overexpressed specifically at each EC tumor grade and in the corresponding SLN. These proteins, which are significantly variable in both locations, should be considered potential markers of overall survival. Five major proteins for EC and SLN (PRSS3, PTX3, ASS1, ALDH2, and ANXA1) were identified in large-scale proteomics and validated by immunohistochemistry. This study improves stratification and diagnosis of individuals with EC as a result of proteomics profiling of SLNs.

Fisheries resources and tourism activities around the lake generate income to support about 50,000 rural inhabitants. The lake's catchment has experienced significant land use, and land cover (LULC) changes due to livelihood diversification in response to ecosystem changes and fisheries decline due to climate warming. We assessed LULC changes between 1986 and 2018 in the lake's catchment using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Satellite imageries from Landsat TM, ETM+, and Sentinel 2A for the periods 1986, 2002, 2007, and 2018 respectively were acquired. A supervised maximum likelihood classification analysis revealed that the lake's surface area had shrunk by 3.7%. In comparison, 22.6% of closed forests and open forests have transitioned to farmlands, built-up areas, and bare lands. Farmlands and built-up areas were increasing at a rate of 5.2% and 5.4% per annum respectively, while closed forest, open forest, and the lake's surface area was reduced by 1.3%, 0.8%, and 0.1% respectively from 1986 to 2018. Management interventions are urgently required to stop the of deforestation if the remaining remnant forestis to be preserved. Data on the identified drivers of LULC changes in the lake's watershed derived from this study would serve as a reference for modelling future LULC changes for the protection of vulnerable areas to help build the resilience of the lake to climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

TI  - Monitoring of dynamic wetland changes using NDVI and NDWI based landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent initiatives using the GIS tools for mapping and analysis of wetland dynamics bring the hope for an effective wetland management. Degraded or modified wetlands are more sensitive and less resilient to the climate change. This paper focusses on a study of water bodies in Sirmaur District, Uttarakhand, India with the special focus on Renuka wetland. The Renuka wetland, a Ramsar site is affected by global warming, floods and storms and changes due to precipitation. The updated or accurate maps and spatial and temporal changes of Renuka wetland are not available. Only the details about the flora and fauna have been recorded in this region. Traditional methods in mapping and monitoring, like field survey and sampling, are usually labour intensive, time consuming, and expensive and often fail to detect the changes over the regions of wetland zones. The present study is carried using the online interactive cloud-based planetary processing open source platform, Google Earth Engine (GEE). The wetland maps considered are Landsat 7 and 8 images with cloud cover less than 30% during the summer (May) and winter (September) seasons. The suitability index is also calculated based on the area and perimeter of the water body in study region to demonstrate the characteristic change of Renuka wetland over the selected time period. The missing data of NDVI and NDWI is fitted using the harmonic time series and the resultant map with the supervised classification Random Forest shows a high overall accuracy of 90% with a reasonable Kappa coefficient of 0.8. Using the Global Water Occurrence Explorer, the water changes intensity and the seasonality water change over the wetland for the period of 1984-2019 are studied. The results showed the significant insight into the changes over the study region in terms of pixel range with the presence of water and the change in locations in terms of seasonality and persistence.

T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons has often been cited as the rationale for the privatization of pastures throughout the world, yet rangeland degradation is still widespread. A significant body of ecological research has demonstrated negative impacts from limiting herd movement through fencing. The privatization of pastures has often followed heterogeneous patterns. We use a natural experiment in common grazing areas on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau where land use was privatized beginning in 1999 following different land use division patterns. We measure the relationship between land use privatization paths and grassland quality using satellite data from 1989 to 2011 in five different villages, and compare how well herder environmental perceptions match satellite data. We find that rangeland degradation has significantly increased following privatization of land use, and that grassland in small individually managed fenced plots is deteriorating more significantly than in larger fenced areas with group herding. We further find that herders' had accurate perceptions of the state of their pastures that closely match remotely sensed data.

TI  - Impacts of partial to complete COVID-19 lockdown on NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in major urban cities of Europe and USA
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) coronavirus has been causing enormous suffering, death, and economic losses world-wide. There are rigorous containment measures on industries, non-essential business, transportation, and citizen mobility to check the spread. The lockdowns may have an advantageous impact on reducing the atmospheric pollutants. This study has analyzed the change in atmospheric pollutants, based on the Sentinel-5Ps and ground-station observed data during partial to complete lockdown period in 2020. Results revealed that the mean tropospheric NO2 concentration substantially dropped in 2020 due to lockdown against the same period in 2019 by 18-40% over the major urban areas located in Europe (i.e. Madrid, Milan, Paris) and the USA (i.e. New York, Boston, and Springfield). Conversely, urban areas with partial to no lockdown measures (i.e. Warsaw, Pierre, Bismarck, and Lincoln) exhibited a relatively lower dropdown in mean NO2 concentration (3 to 7.5%). The role of meteorological variability was found to be negligible. Nevertheless, the reduced levels of atmospheric pol-lutants were primarily attributed to the shutdown of vehicles, power plants, and industrial emissions. Improvement in air quality during COVID-19 may be temporary, but regulatory bodies should learn to reduce air pollution on a long-term basis concerning the trade-offs between the environment, society, and economic growth. The intersection of urban design, health, and environment should be addressed by policy-makers to protect public health and sustainable urban policies could be adopted to build urban resilience against any future emergencies.

TI  - Exploring diurnal thermal variations in urban local climate zones with ECOSTRESS land surface temperature data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive heat in urban areas affects the overall livability of cities and harms the health of urban dwellers. Understanding the spatiotemporal variations of land surface temperature (LST) and the thermal impacts of heterogeneous urban forms is crucial for informing mitigation strategies to improve the urban thermal environment. However, the diurnal thermal dynamics over urban areas has been rarely studied due to the polarorbiting nature of conventional satellite platforms (e.g., Landsat Series, Terra, Aqua). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) latest Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides LST observations at a 70 m resolution for different times of day and night, and thereby offers unprecedented opportunities for exploring the LST diurnal dynamics. We used ECOSTRESS data to explore the diurnal cycling of LST and variations among local climate zones (LCZs) in Xi'an, a megacity in Northwest China. The urban area was segmented into 2733 community units that were classified into seven LCZs. We examined the intra-LCZ variation of LST at different times of day and night to investigate the thermal impact of urban landscapes. Distinct thermal patterns across LCZs were observed during the day: urban landscapes of compact buildings tended to heat up faster than open buildings, and low-rise zones generally had higher LST than high-rise LCZs in both compact and open urban forms. At night, compact buildings had higher LST than the open buildings, but the LST difference was insignificant. Meanwhile, building heights had little effects on LST at night. We also found that vegetation cover, percentage of impervious surface, and population size were related to LST, while the strength of the relationship varied for different times of day and night. Our study demonstrates the great potential of the new ECOSTRESS LST observations in studying the diurnal variations of urban thermal environments with fine spatial resolution. Our findings can provide insight into the impacts of urban form on local climate and can inform municipalities on the development of targeted heat mitigation strategies.

TI  - A Multigrid InSAR Technique for Joint Analyses at Single-Look and Multi-Look Scales
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes a multigrid differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) technique for the detection of ground displacements at different spatial scales. The method relies on efficient phase-unwrapping (PhU) operations performed at the native spatial scales. In particular, a set of multi-look interferograms are first unwrapped using conventional (or advanced) PhU algorithms at the regional scale. Subsequently, ML unwrapped interferograms are used to facilitate the PhU operations performed at the local scale (single-look). Specifically, the unwrapped multi-look interferograms are resampled to the single-look grid and modulo-2 pi subtracted to the single-look interferograms. These phase residuals are then unwrapped and added back to the multi-look resampled interferograms. To accomplish these operations, at variance with alternative multiscale methods, no (linear/nonlinear) models are used to fit the spatial high-pass phase residuals. Finally, the unwrapped single-look interferograms are properly inverted to retrieve the ground displacement time series using any small baseline (SB)-oriented multitemporal InSAR tool. Experimental results are performed by processing a set of SAR data acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed sensor over the coastal area of Shanghai, China.

TI  - Vegetation structure parameters determine high burn severity likelihood in different ecosystem types: A case study in a burned Mediterranean landscape.
T2  - Journal of environmental management
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The design and implementation of pre-fire management strategies in heterogeneous landscapes requires the identification of the ecological conditions contributing to the most adverse effects of wildfires. This study evaluates which features of pre-fire vegetation structure, estimated through broadband land surface albedo and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data fusion, promote high wildfire damage across several fire-prone ecosystems dominated by either shrub (gorse, heath and broom) or tree species (Pyrenean oak and Scots pine). Topography features were also considered since they can assist in the identification of priority areas where vegetation structure needs to be managed. The case study was conducted within the scar of a mixed-severity wildfire that occurred in the Western Mediterranean Basin. Burn severity was estimated using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio index computed from Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) Level 2A at 10m of spatial resolution and validated in the field using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Ordinal regression models were implemented to evaluate high burn severity outcome based on three groups of predictors: topography, pre-fire broadband land surface albedo computed from Sentinel-2 and pre-fire LiDAR metrics. Models were validated both by 10-fold cross-validation and external validation. High burn severity was largely ecosystem-dependent. In oak and pine forest ecosystems, severe damage was promoted by a high canopy volume (model accuracy=79%) and a low canopy base height (accuracy=82%), respectively. Land surface albedo, which is directly related to aboveground biomass and vegetation cover, outperformed LiDAR metrics to predict high burn severity in ecosystems with sparse vegetation. This is the case of gorse and broom shrub ecosystems (accuracy of 80% and 77%, respectively). The effect of topography was overwhelmed by that of the vegetation structure portion of the fire triangle behavior, except for heathlands, in which warm and steep slopes played a key role in high burn severity outcome together with horizontal and vertical fuel continuity (accuracy=71%). The findings of this study support the fusion of LiDAR and satellite albedo data to assist forest managers in the development of ecosystem-specific management actions aimed at reducing wildfire damage and promote ecosystem resilience.

TI  - Estimation of Above-Ground Carbon-Stocks for Urban Greeneries in Arid Areas: Case Study for Doha and FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are significant sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), which elevates air pollution. However, urban greenery has a positive effect on mitigating air pollution and the impact of CO2 on the climate. Quantifying the benefits of greenery for urban environments involves complex calculations and requires significant resources. Such a quantifying exercise is not cost-effective. The satellite remote sensing method can analyze current and near-present carbon-stock dynamics through spectral band imaging. In this research study, field measurements determine above-ground carbon (AGC) stock. The field measurements are derived from three types of land use, comprising public parks and gardens, institutional parks, and street and avenue greenery in selected locations in Doha city in Qatar. These field measurements are then correlated with results from satellite images. Linear and non-linear regression models are established between AGC and five vegetative spectral indices (VIs) derived from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The AGC stock for the selected locations in Doha in 2014 is evaluated using the highest coefficient of determination with the highest accuracy expected. The results of the analysis reveal that both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R-2 = 0.64) and the relative ratio vegetation index (R-2 = 0.71) significantly correlate with the AGC in public parks. In avenue vegetation, all the VIs exhibit high R-2, but the best fit is NDVI (R-2 = 0.87). The CO2 equivalent range evaluated from the AGC in the plots studied in Doha is measured as 650.6 tons for the period between 2014 and 2020, with an annual sequestration rate of 108.4 tons per year. This CO2 equivalent storage amount has the social value of USD 42,286, which is the equivalent of QR 155,192. The AGC-VI correlation in land-use groups may be influenced by the turf grass and impervious surfaces in the background of the images. Further study of urban landscapes and vegetation with high biomass is likely to show its positive effects for cities and that it can improve carbon dioxide abatement, resulting in more sustainable societies. This improvement in CO2 abatement in Qatar can be useful for various environmental estimations for the upcoming mega event of World Cup 2022.

TI  - Using geospatial technology to analyse land use/cover changes in Prishtina, Kosovo (2000-2020)
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Extremely important elements to see the effect of human activities on the one hand and, on the other hand, monitoring changes in the environment are land use and cover (LULC). These elements offer us a great opportunity to determine how much a certain space has been developed rationally (use of natural environmental resources) and how much this space has deviated from such a development. In terms of issues related to monitoring LULC changes, geospatial technology is quite useful. In our study, Landsat satellite imagery was classified using supervised classification-Maximum Likelihood using ArcMap software to determine LULC changes (LULCC). To determine these changes, satellite images of Landsat 7 (ETM +) for 2000, and Landsat 8 (OLI) for 2020 were used. In this study, the main purpose was to quantify the changes in LULC during the period 2000-2020 in the Municipality of Prishtina. A total of 5 classes were defined in our study area: vegetation, built-up areas, body water, agriculture areas, and bare lands. From all this monitoring and our results obtained, we found that there were changes in LULC in our study area. From 2000 to 2020, from the achieved results, it is pointed out that the built areas have increased by 3.15% (from 13 km(2) to 29.46 km(2)); bare lands by 7.65% (from 93.03 km(2) to 132.87 km(2)), while vegetation decreased by 1.38% (from 344.11 km(2) to 336.85 km(2)); body water by 0.39% (from 1.3 km(2) to 0.91 km(2)); agricultural lands by 9.31% (from 71.31 km(2) to 22.66 km(2)). Given the growing population and, consequently, the growing demand, the information received from Remote Sensing and GIS techniques offers tremendous assistance in providing the most optimal solutions to make proper planning on meeting the growing demands of human needs on the exploitation of natural environmental resources.

TI  - Significant underestimation of radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions derived from satellite-based methods
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based estimates of radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci) are consistently smaller than those from global models, hampering accurate projections of future climate change. Here we show that the discrepancy can be substantially reduced by correcting sampling biases induced by inherent limitations of satellite measurements, which tend to artificially discard the clouds with high cloud fraction. Those missed clouds exert a stronger cooling effect, and are more sensitive to aerosol perturbations. By accounting for the sampling biases, the magnitude of RFaci (from -0.38 to -0.59Wm(-2)) increases by 55 % globally (133 % over land and 33 % over ocean). Notably, the RFaci further increases to -1.09Wm(-2) when switching total aerosol optical depth (AOD) to fine-mode AOD that is a better proxy for CCN than AOD. In contrast to previous weak satellite-based RFaci, the improved one substantially increases (especially over land), resolving a major difference with models. Satellite-based estimates of radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions are consistently smaller than those from global models, hampering accurate projections of future climate change. Here, the authors show that the discrepancy can be substantially reduced by correcting sampling biases induced by inherent limitations of satellite measurements.

TI  - Impact of acute exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> on non-trauma all-cause mortality in the megacity Delhi
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the largest environmental health risk in India. All previous studies in India focused on PM10 exposure for acute impact assessment; even the single study examining the PM2.5 acute exposure impact used data from a single site. Here we estimated the impact of acute PM2.5 exposure on non-trauma all-cause mortality in the megacity Delhi using a quasi-Poisson regression model and satellitederived high-resolution (1-km) exposure data. Our satellite-PM2.5 dataset was calibrated and validated against coincident measurements from ground-based reference-grade monitors. This allowed us to minimize exposure misclassification, which otherwise would have happened due to reliance on limited ground-based monitoring sites with a large spatial gap. The annual average (median) PM2.5 exposure (with interquartile range) during this period was 108.5 (63.5-133.6) mu g/m3. We found a 0.52% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.42-0.62%) increase in non-trauma all-cause mortality for every 10 mu g/m3 increase in 6-days cumulative PM2.5 exposure with a relatively higher impact on men (0.57%, 95% CI: 0.46-0.69%) than on women (0.52%, 0.38-0.65%). The impact of PM2.5 was almost two-fold higher in winter (0.55%, 0.45-0.66%) per 10 mu g/m3 increase in PM2.5 than in summer (0.29%, 0.14-0.45%). The district-level aggregated 6-days cumulative PM2.5 exposure had the largest impact on mortality (1.10%, 0.84-1.35%). The impact of acute exposure to PM2.5 on all-cause mortality was larger than that of PM10 exposure (from previous studies). Our study adds to the global evidence pool, fills the critical gap of evidence of acute PM2.5 exposure impact on mortality in India, and most importantly, demonstrates the significance of disaggregated exposure assessment using satellite data to reduce exposure misclassification in health impact studies, particularly in data-poor regions. Main finding: We estimate a 0.52% increase in all-cause mortality for every 10 mu g/m3 rise in short-term PM2.5 exposure with a two-fold higher impact in the winter than in the summer and a higher impact on male (0.57%) than on female (0.52%) in the megacity Delhi.

T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Platelet aggregation at the site of atherosclerotic vascular injury is the underlying pathophysiology of myocardial infarction and stroke. To build upon prior GWAS, here we report on 16 loci identified through a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach in 3,855 NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) participants deeply phenotyped for platelet aggregation. We identify the RGS18 locus, which encodes a myeloerythroid lineage-specific regulator of G-protein signaling that co-localizes with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) signatures for RGS18 expression in platelets. Gene-based approaches implicate the SVEP1 gene, a known contributor of coronary artery disease risk. Sentinel variants at RGS18 and PEAR1 are associated with thrombosis risk and increased gastrointestinal bleeding risk, respectively. Our WGS findings add to previously identified GWAS loci, provide insights regarding the mechanism(s) by which genetics may influence cardiovascular disease risk, and underscore the importance of rare variant and regulatory approaches to identifying loci contributing to complex phenotypes. Platelet aggregation is associated with myocardial infarction and stroke. Here, the authors have conducted a whole genome sequencing association study on platelet aggregation, discovering a locus in RGS18, where enhancer assays suggest an effect on activity of haematopoeitic lineage transcription factors.

For such a purpose, a constrained quadratic objective function is defined which is then solved using well-established quadratic programming approaches. Not only does the output of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system replicates the measured value, but also it provides the lower bound and the upper bound for measured data values. In the proposed approach, to have more valuable information, a penalty term is added in the cost functions to have full control over the width of prediction interval. This method has been successfully applied to two benchmark identification problems. It is observed that by using the control parameter in the cost function, it is possible to obtain a narrower, yet inclusive prediction interval. Furthermore, superior prediction accuracy is obtained compared to existing methods in literature. Motivated by these results, the proposed approach is used to predict time series collected using a satellite from Urmia lake water level which resulted in high accuracy and an inclusive prediction interval. The graphical abstract presented for the paper illustrates the overall data gathering as well as data analysis made to estimate the prediction interval associated with Urmia lake water level data.

TI  - Serial step sections at narrow intervals with immunohistochemistry are required for accurate histological assessment of sentinel lymph node biopsy in oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an accurate staging modality in early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but its accuracy relies on labor-intensive histopathology protocols. We sought to determine whether serial step sections with immunohistochemistry (SSSIHC) at narrow intervals of the entire SLN are required to accurately exclude metastasis.Methods Consecutive SLN biopsies over a 13-year period were retrospectively evaluated. If the index section was negative for carcinoma, the entire SLN was subjected to SSSIHC at 150 mu m intervals. The first section level and total number of section levels to contain carcinoma were recorded.Results One hundred and eighteen SLN+ from 90 patients were included. SSSIHC upstaged the nodal status in 19.5% of patients. Metastasis was identified in 16.7% and 10.2% beyond section levels 4 and 6, respectively. Among SLNs requiring SSSIHC, 47.5% contained carcinoma in a single section level.Conclusion SSSIHC of the entire SLN at 150 mu m intervals are required to identify occult metastasis in OSCC.

TI  - The sentinel node invasion level (SNIL) as a prognostic parameter in melanoma
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SN) tumor burden is becoming increasingly important and is likely to be included in future N classifications in melanoma. Our aim was to investigate the prognostic significance of melanoma infiltration of various anatomically defined lymph node substructures. This retrospective cohort study included 1250 consecutive patients with SN biopsy. The pathology protocol required description of metastatic infiltration of each of the following lymph node substructures: intracapsular lymph vessels, subcapsular and transverse sinuses, cortex, paracortex, medulla, and capsule. Within the SN with the highest tumor burden, the SN invasion level (SNIL) was defined as follows: SNIL 1 = melanoma cells confined to intracapsular lymph vessels, subcapsular or transverse sinuses; SNIL 2 = melanoma infiltrating the cortex or paracortex; SNIL 3 = melanoma infiltrating the medulla or capsule. We classified 338 SN-positive patients according to the non-metric SNIL. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox models, recurrence-free survival (RFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and nodal basin recurrence rates were analyzed. The median follow-up time was 75 months. The SNIL divided the SN-positive population into three groups with significantly different RFS, MSS, and nodal basin recurrence probabilities. The MSS of patients with SNIL 1 was virtually identical to that of SN-negative patients, whereas outgrowth of the metastasis from the parenchyma into the fibrous capsule or the medulla of the lymph node indicated a very poor prognosis. Thus, the SNIL may help to better assess the benefit-risk ratio of adjuvant therapies in patients with different SN metastasis patterns.

TI  - Intelligent Energy Management Strategy Based on an Improved Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With Exploration Factor for a Plug-in PHEV
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - An intelligent energy management strategy (EMS) based on an improved Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm is developed to enhance the adaptability of the EMS and to further improve the fuel efficiency of a Plug-in Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). Both the numerical model and the energy management strategy of a plug-in PHEV are described. The improved RL with Q-learning algorithm is implemented to acquire the optimal control strategies for improving fuel economy. The Markov Chain is employed to calculate the Transition Probability Matrix of the required power. A Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate is designed to activate the update of EMS, when a new corresponding driving cycle is expected. An Exploration Factor (FT) is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of the normal RL algorithm in convergence rate and reward cost evaluation. The diverse KL divergence rates are examined to seek optimal solutions. The normal-RI, strategy, rule-based strategy, and dynamic programming strategy are implemented as benchmark strategies to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The validation results indicate that the improved RL algorithm with FY makes it possible to promote the EMS capable of significantly improving the energy efficiency of a plug-in PHEV.

TI  - Preoperative planar lymphoscintigraphy allows for sentinel lymph node detection in 51 dogs improving staging accuracy: Feasibility and pitfalls
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is the current gold standard for the oncological staging of solid malignancies in humans. This prospective observational study describes the feasibility and the limits of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for SLN detection in dogs with spontaneous malignancies and the improvements in staging accuracy. Client-owned dogs with confirmed malignant neoplasia and absence of distant metastasis were prospectively enrolled. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed after the peritumoral injection of Technetium-99m labeled nanocolloids. Regional dynamic and static images were acquired, with and without masking of the injection site with a lead shield. The dogs were then subjected to surgery for tumor excision and SLN extirpation. Intraoperative SLN detection was performed by combining methylene blue dye and a dedicated gamma probe. Overall, 51 dogs with a total of 60 solid malignant tumors were enrolled. Lymphoscintigraphy identified at least one SLN in 57 of 60 cases (95%). The SLN did not always correspond to the regional lymph node (35/57, 61.4%). The use of a lead shield, masking the injection site, markedly improved the SLN visibility. The median time of SLN appearance was 11.4 +/- 9.3 min. No side effects were observed. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy allows for SLN detection in dogs and can improve staging accuracy by either identifying the SLN in a different lymphosome than clinically expected or discriminating the draining node in uncertain cases. The combined use of preoperative and intraoperative techniques is recommended to increase the SLN detection rate.

TI  - An approach for soil moisture estimation using urban and vegetation fraction cover from coarse resolution Scatsat-1 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) estimation using coarse resolution satellite data, like Scatsat-1 scatterometer data (2 km spatial resolution), is still challenging due to various land cover classes present within a single pixel. To estimate SM from coarse resolution data, there is a necessity to study the contribution of different land covers to the total backscatter signal of the single pixel. The estimation of SM is very much dependent on the accuracy of the backscatter signal from the soil component. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified water cloud model to compute the soil-backscattering signal by correcting the backscatter contribution due to urban and vegetation fraction cover. The backscattering signal from the soil surface is then used to retrieve SM. The retrieved SM is compared with the ground truth SM using the error metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias (b), correlation coefficient (r), and average relative error (ARE). The proposed model is tested in three conditions: first, when only vegetation correction is applied, RMSE, mean bias, r, and ARE are found to be 0.086 m(3)/m(3), 0.70 m(3)/m(3), 0.534, and 0.24, respectively, and results show an overestimation in SM. Second, when both vegetation and urban correction are applied using the actual fraction, the accuracy is improved with an RMSE, mean bias, and ARE of 0.071 m(3)/m(3), 0.056 m(3)/m(3), and 0.20, respectively. However, in the third condition, when the urban fraction cover is considered twice the actual value, the RMSE and mean bias are found to be 0.22 m(3)/m(3) and -0.10 m(3)/m(3), respectively, and results show an underestimation in SM.

TI  - Reduction of surface radiative forcing observed from remote sensing data during global COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The calamity of the COVID-19 pandemic during the early half of 2020 not only caused a huge physical and economic loss but altered the social behavior of the whole world. The social and economic stagnation imposed in many countries and served as a major cause of perturbation in atmospheric composition. This paper utilized the relation between atmospheric composition and surface radiation and analyzed the impact of global COVID-19 lockdown on land surface solar and thermal radiation. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiation are obtained from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and European Reanalysis product (ERA5) reanalysis product. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) while Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are obtained from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Observations of all mentioned parameters are studied for the global lockdown period of 2020 (from January to July) and compared with the corresponding months of the previous four years (2016-19) observations. Regarding surface radiation, April 2020 is the most affected month during the pandemic in which 0.2% increased net solar radiation (NSR), while 3.45% and 4.8% decreased net thermal radiation (NTR) and net radiation (NR) respectively was observed. Average radiative forcing during March-May 2020 was observed as 1.09 Wm-2, -2.19 Wm-2 and -1.09 Wm-2 for NSR, NTR and NR, respectively. AOD was reduced by 0.2% in May 2020 while NO2 and SO2 were reduced by 5.4% and 8.8%, respectively, in April 2020. It was observed that NO2 kept on reducing since January 2020 while SO2 kept on reducing since February 2020 which were the prelockdown months. These results suggest that a more sophisticated analysis is needed to explain the atmosphereradiation relation.

TI  - Sentinel: An Onboard Lane Change Advisory System for Intelligent Vehicles to Reduce Traffic Delay During Freeway Incidents
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces Sentinel, an onboard system for intelligent vehicles that guides their lane changing behavior during a freeway incident with the goal of reducing traffic congestion, capacity drop, and delay. When an incident blocking the lanes ahead is detected, Sentinel calculates the probability of leaving the blocked lane(s) before reaching the incident point at each time step. It advises the vehicle to leave the blocked lane(s) when that probability drops below a certain threshold, as the vehicle nears the congestion boundary. By doing this, Sentinel reduces the number of late-stage lane changes of vehicles in the blocked lane(s) trying to move to other lanes, and distributes those maneuvers upstream of the incident point. A simulation case study is conducted in which one lane of a four-lane section of the 1-66 interstate highway in the US. is temporarily blocked due to an incident, to understand how Sentinel impacts traffic flow and how different parameters - traffic flow, system penetration rate, and incident duration - affect Sentinel's performance. The results show that Sentinel has a positive impact on traffic flow, reducing average delay by up to 37%, particularly when it has a considerable penetration rate. Working alongside Traffic Incident Management Systems (TIMS), Sentinel can be a valuable asset for reducing traffic delay and potentially saving billions of dollars annually in costs associated with congestion caused by freeway incidents.

TI  - Pragmatic Augmentation Algorithms for Deep Learning-Based Cloud and Cloud Shadow Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of clouds and their shadows are two major preprocessing steps for providing an effective interpretation of remotely sensed optical images. Although deep learning-based methods have proved to deliver competent performance for detecting clouds and cloud shadows, improving their generalization ability for reliable results requires a large number of training images and accurate ground truths. As creating ground truth of cloud and cloud shadow is expensive, a practical way to generate more images and their ground truths is to use data augmentation methods. We propose two new data augmentation approaches (one for generating synthetic clouds in scenes and the other one for creating cloud shadows with different levels of shade) so as to achieve natural-looking images with little or no effort required for creating their ground truths. Our experiments show that while each of these approaches is capable of boosting cloud and cloud shadow segmentation individually, the fusion of them improves detecting cloud and shadow in a simultaneous learning pipeline, leading to outperforming the state-of-the-art results.

TI  - Measurement report: An assessment of the impact of a nationwide lockdown on air pollution - a remote sensing perspective over India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The nationwide lockdown was imposed over India from 25 March to 31 May 2020 with varied relaxations from phase I to phase IV to contain the spread of COVID-19. Thus, emissions from industrial and transport sectors were halted during lockdown (LD), which has resulted in a significant reduction of anthropogenic pollutants. The first two lockdown phases were strictly implemented (phase I and phase II) and hence were considered to be total lockdown (TLD) in this study. Satellite-based tropospheric columnar nitrogen dioxide (TCN) from the years 2015 to 2020, tropospheric columnar carbon monoxide (TCC) during 2019/20, and aerosol optical depth (AOD(550)) from the years 2014 to 2020 during phase I and phase II LD and pre-LD periods were investigated with observations from Aura OMI, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, and Aqua and Terra MODIS. To quantify lockdown-induced changes in TCN, TCC, and AOD(550), detailed statistical analysis was performed on detrended data using the Student paired statistical t test. Results indicate that mean TCN levels over India showed a dip of 18 % compared to the previous year and also against the 5-year mean TCN levels during the phase I lockdown, which was found to be statistically significant (p value < 0.05) against the respective period. Furthermore, drastic changes in TCN levels were observed over hotspots, namely eastern region and urban cities. For example, there was a sharp decrease of 62 % and 54 % in TCN levels compared to 2019 and against 5-year mean TCN levels over New Delhi with a p value of 0.0002 (which is statistically significant) during total LD. The TCC levels were high in the northeast (NE) region during the phase I LD period, which is mainly attributed to the active fire counts in this region. However, lower TCC levels are observed in the same region due to the diminished fire counts during phase II. Further, AOD(550) is reduced over the country by similar to 16 % (Aqua and Terra) from the 6-year (2014-2019) mean AOD(550) levels, with a significant reduction (Aqua MODIS 28 %) observed over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region with a p value of << 0.05. However, an increase in AOD(550) levels (25 % for Terra MODIS, 15 % for Aqua MODIS) was also observed over central India during LD compared to the preceding year and found significant with a p value of 0.03. This study also reports the rate of change of TCN levels and AOD(550) along with statistical metrics during the LD period.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR observations of co- and post-seismic deformation mechanisms of the 2016 Mw 5.9 Menyuan Earthquake, Northwestern China
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On January 21, 2016, a Mw 5.9 earthquake occurred in Menyuan, Qinghai Province, in northwestern China, which is an earthquakeprone region located along the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the source parameters, deformation mechanism, especially the influence of this earthquake on the surrounding regions and on post-seismic deformation, remains poorly understood. In this study, Sentinel-1 images from ascending and descending tracks were used to investigate the co- and post-seismic deformation fields. Uniform and distributed slip models were used to determine the source parameters. Finally, the co- and post-earthquake two-dimensional (2D) deformation decomposition, coulomb failure stress changes caused by the 2016 Menyuan earthquake, and the influence of this event on the surrounding region and active faults were analyzed. The results suggest that the 2016 Menyuan earthquake was triggered by a concomitant buried reverse fault in the northeastern part of the Northern Lenglongling Fault, which is a SW dipping sinistral thrust fault with a strike angle of 140 degrees. The fault properties are consistent with the results of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) 2D decompositions. The co-seismic deformation of the two satellite tracks have maximum line-of-sight uplifts of 55 mm and 65 mm, without notable subsidence. The post-seismic effect of the earthquake mainly affected the area between the Lenglongling Fault and the Northern Lenglongling Fault. The earthquake caused stress loading on the southwest of the western segment of the Lenglongling Fault and on the southeast of the eastern segment of the Northern Lenglongling Fault, as well as along these two faults.

TI  - Beyond intensity of urban heat island effect: A continental scale analysis on land surface temperature in major Chinese cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensity of urban heat island (UHII) is a key indicator to quantify the magnitude of UHI effect. Change in UHII, however, can be affected by change in urban or rural temperature, or both. Numerous studies have investigated the change of UHII, but how it relates to change in urban and rural temperature is poorly understood. Here we present a continental scale analysis on the change in UHII from 2000 to 2015 in 31 major cities in China, and further explored whether such change was caused by urban warming. We used time series analysis based on MODIS land surface temperature product (MOD11A2) in summer. We found: (1) A majority of the cities (25 out of 31) had an increasing trend in UHII from 2000 to 2015, among which 44% were significant, suggesting a significantly intensified UHI effects. (2) Intensified UHII does not necessarily mean deterioration of urban thermal environment, and vice versa. For the 25 cities with an increasing trend in UHII, 11 cities had a decreasing trend of LST in both urban and rural areas. Meanwhile, for the 6 cities with a decreasing trend in UHII, three had warming trend in both urban and rural areas. (3) The attribution of changes in UHII to that of urban and rural LST indicated that it is necessary to quantify the change of LST in both urban and rural areas to fully quantify the impact of urbanization on UHI effect.

TI  - Factors associated with medical problems among young non-deployed US military working dogs
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The goals of this project were to quantify medical problems among a population of Military Working Dogs (MWDs) and analyze factors associated with common medical conditions. Medical conditions recorded in veterinary Master Problem List (MPL) entries for 774 young, non-deployed, active MWDs were categorized and combined with demographic information to analyze risk factors. Most dogs were male (74%), German Shepherd (39%) or Belgian Malinois (31%) breeds, certified in Explosive Detection (60%), and had a dark coat color (83%). Ages ranged from one to six years, with an average of 2.6 years (+/- 0.5 years). Eighty-three percent of dogs had a non-surgical medical problem in their record. The most common non-surgical medical problems were dermatologic (25% of MPL entries), alimentary (21%), dental (15%), soft-tissue injury (10%), and musculoskeletal conditions (4%). Factors associated with each medical condition were breed (Odds Ratios 1.96-8.24), sex and spay/neuter status (ORs 1.78-5.77), occupational duty certification (ORs 2.65-3.62), military command location (ORs 2.32-7.44), and military branch (OR 5.16). As MWDs are a valuable asset for the Department of Defense, training and work conditions for the identified at-risk groups of MWDs should be further assessed to maximize their operational capabilities and assess the potential to serve as sentinel indicators for human diseases. Improved understanding of the most common medical problems affecting MWDs, and the identification of factors associated with these conditions, can help drive changes in their preventive care.

TI  - Contrast enhanced computed tomography assessment of superficial inguinal lymph node metastasis in canine mammary gland tumors
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mammary gland neoplasms are predominant in dogs. However, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status assessment criteria have not been established for these cases. In this retrospective, secondary analysis, diagnostic case control study, CT images of 65 superficial inguinal SLNs were obtained before and 1, 3, 5, and 10 min after intravenous administration of contrast agent (iopamidol 370 mgI/mL). The presence and degree of postcontrast enhancement were assessed, by means of the median absolute density value and the maximum absolute density value at any time point in the center and in the periphery of each SLN measured in Hounsfield units (HU), before and after contrast agent administration. These values were compared with histopathological findings postsurgical excision. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted. The absolute density values ranged widely at each time point and within each group of nodes (negative, positive, control group). At all time points, the median density value in the center and in the periphery was significantly higher in metastatic than in non-metastatic SLNs (P <= .014). Among the parameters tested, the median absolute density value measured in the periphery of the SLN 3 min after injection showed the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (AUC) (87.5%, 82.1%, and 92.1% respectively), with a cutoff value of 50.9 HU. The maximum absolute density value at any time point in the center and periphery of the SLNs was also significantly higher in metastatic SLNs compared to non-metastatic (P <= .001). With a cutoff value of 59.5 HU, the maximum absolute density value in the periphery of the SLN displayed high sensitivity and specificity (87.5% and 89.3%, respectively). The results of this study support the hypothesis that contrast enhanced CT imaging may aid in the assessment of SLN metastasis in dogs with mammary gland neoplasms.

TI  - <i>Pila virens</i> as sentinel of silica nanoparticles toxicity induced oxidative stress
T2  - MATERIALS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aquatic ecosystem is under threat due to the continuous inlet of various emerging contaminants affecting the inhabiting organisms. The Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are among the most abundantly produced nanoparticles globally posing a threat to the aquatic organisms because of their entry into aquatic ecosystem through various point and nonpoint sources. In this work, we report the toxicological impacts of SiNPs on fresh water snail Pila virens (P.virens) as a biomonitor. The acute toxicity of SiNPs on P. virens was performed in a 96 h static renewal tests. The median lethal concentration of SiNPs for 96 h on P. virens is 366.92 mu g/L. The P. virens were exposed to 165 mu g/L for 24 and 48 h respectively shown a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl, superoxide dismutase and reduction in total glutathione content in comparison to their controls. The fresh water edible snail P. virens serve as model organisms for other engineered nanomaterials toxicity.

TI  - Investigation the seasonality effect on impervious surface detection from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images using Google Earth engine
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface mapping is of great importance in urban studies. Impervious surfaces are major components of urban infrastructures and their expansion represents urban development. These surfaces mainly include built-up areas and streets; they are composed of various materials and found in diverse sizes and shapes. Impervious surface detection is challenging due to the confusion of these surfaces with other land cover classes. These confusions are not constant over different seasons, as seasonality affects the target's responses. This study particularly focused on the seasonal effect on impervious surface detection using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to find the optimum season. The study area is the city of Sanandaj, in the west of Iran. All processes have been executed on the Google Earth Engine as it provides a platform to access and process the satellite images. To exclude the effect of the classification algorithm on the obtained results, three commonly used classifiers have been compared; i.e., maximum likelihood, support vector machine, and neural network. The results show that spring is the best season to delineate impervious surfaces from remaining land covers, while the use of winter images does not provide acceptable results. Sentinel-2 results outperform Sentinel-1. Variation in topography and high sensitivity of SAR responses to moisture and volume structure hinder the application of Sentinel-1 images in the heterogeneous urban area. The built-up class has higher producer accuracy as compared to the street class. There was considerable confusion between the street and bare soil classes in both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Arctic sea ice cover data from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar by deep learning
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Widely used sea ice concentration and sea ice cover in polar regions are derived mainly from space-borne microwave radiometer and scatterometer data, and the typical spatial resolution of these products ranges from several to dozens of kilometers. Due to dramatic changes in polar sea ice, high-resolution sea ice cover data are drawing increasing attention for polar navigation, environmental research, and offshore operations. In this paper, we focused on developing an approach for deriving a high-resolution sea ice cover product for the Arctic using Sentinel-1 (S1) dual-polarization (horizontal-horizontal, HH, and horizontal-vertical, HV) data in extra wide swath (EW) mode. The approach for discriminating sea ice from open water by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is based on a modified U-Net architecture, a deep learning network. By employing an integrated stacking model to combine multiple U-Net classifiers with diverse specializations, sea ice segmentation is achieved with superior accuracy over any individual classifier. We applied the proposed approach to over 28 000 S1 EW images acquired in 2019 to obtain sea ice cover products in a high spatial resolution of 400 m. The validation by 96 cases of visual interpretation results shows an overall accuracy of 96.10 %. The S1-derived sea ice cover was converted to concentration and then compared with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sea ice concentration data, showing an average absolute difference of 5.55% with seasonal fluctuations. A direct comparison with Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) daily sea ice cover data achieves an average accuracy of 93.98 %. These results show that the developed S1-derived sea ice cover results are comparable to the AMSR and IMS data in terms of overall accuracy but superior to these data in presenting detailed sea ice cover information, particularly in the marginal ice zone (MIZ).

TI  - A novel automatic method on pseudo-invariant features extraction for enhancing the relative radiometric normalization of high-resolution images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative radiometric normalization (RRN) is a critical preprocessing step that is widely applied to remote sensing data. Essential to RRN are the pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) - ground objects with invariant reflectance across the acquisition dates of multiple images. To meet the requirements of RRN for change detection in multi-temporal images, this paper proposed a novel automatic method for PIF extraction: first, we calculated spectral, spatial, and visual features for the images. Next, a set of change vectors were generated to quantify the features' differences. Then, the initial PIF was obtained by synthesizing similar pixels from each change vector. Finally, an iterative linear regression was performed to generate the final PIFs. Furthermore, we employed the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to establish the RRN model for normalizing the target image. The methods and workflow of PIF extraction and the RRN model establishment were validated with two TripleSat-2 multi-spectral images with a spatial resolution of 3.2 metres. The applicability of the proposed PIF extraction method was further validated by Landsat-8 OLI, GF-1 WFV, Sentinel-2 MSI, and WorldView-2 images. The results showed that: (1) The proposed PIF extraction method can automatically obtain the PIFs with high precision. Based on the extracted PIFs, the RANSAC algorithm is capable of building the RRN model with a significant linear relationship. (2) The PIF extraction method is applicable to multi-spectral images with different spatial resolutions. (3) Compared with the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) and the iteratively reweighted MAD (IR-MAD), the proposed PIF extraction method achieved a better performance in selecting the pixels with smaller radiometric differences, which is helpful to reach a higher accuracy of the RRN model. (4) Differences in image brightness, spectral domain, and spatial domain are considered in the PIF extraction method with fewer parameters and high portability. (5) Spectral features are dominant to obtain ideal PIFs, and feature combinations can get the advantages to enhance the effectiveness of the PIFs.

TI  - A comprehensive yield evaluation indicator based on an improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and hyperspectral data
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely estimation of winter-wheat yield at the field and regional scales is critical to developing agricultural management strategies and reducing the effect of changes in environmental conditions on crop yield. Growth status and trend (GST) monitoring has been widely applied to estimate agronomic parameters using remote sensing methods. Many studies have employed GST monitoring, however, most of them were based on a single agronomic parameter and can therefore only represent one-sided or local GST information. Additionally, each agronomic parameter is interactive. Meanwhile, little studies have systemically combined multiple agronomic parameters into one comprehensive indicator to estimate crop yield using remote sensing data. Thus, the objectives of the current research were to build a comprehensive yield evaluation indicator (CYEI) using the improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method and evaluate the performance of CYEI to monitor GST and estimate yield. The results showed that the CYEI can fully reflect the information of the leaf area index, leaf biomass, leaf water content, and leaf nitrogen content. Compared with various agronomic parameters, the CYEI based on the improved FCE method was more closely correlated with the yield (the R2 values of the validation set were 0.63, 0.69, and 0.63 at the booting stage, anthesis stage, and milk development stage.). The CYEI was estimated using a linear model constructed using the optimal VIs, and the results for the three growth stages achieved a higher precision (R2 = 0.74, 0.74, and 0.68 for the booting, anthesis, and milk development stages, respectively) than the traditional single agronomic parameter. The CYEI and Bayesian information criterion were then used to select VIs and then build a partial least squares regression model to estimate the yield. The estimation accuracy was found to be satisfactory, with R2 values of 0.55, 0.64, and 0.66 at the booting, anthesis, and milk development stages, respectively. Finally, a more intuitive image-scale yield monitoring method was obtained based on unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing hyperspectral imagery. In the future, the proposed method can be used to obtain wheat growth information and provide a new prediction indicator to better estimate yield in precision agriculture.

TI  - Decadal variations in natural and anthropogenic aerosol optical depth over the Bay of Bengal: the influence of pollutants from Indo-GangeticPlain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Perennial increase in atmospheric pollution over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and South China Sea is reported due to increase in human population and industrial activity in South and Southeast Asia. Based on total aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from MODIS (moderate resolution imaging resolution imaging spectroradiometer), natural and anthropogenic fractions were derived. The seasonality and spatial variability in rate of increase in total, natural, and anthropogenic AOD fractions were examined over the BoB using data collected between 2001 and 2019. Both total and anthropogenic AOD displayed statistically significant rate of increase in the northwest BoB (NWB) and western coastal BoB (WCB) regions during 2001 to 2019 whereas the long-term changes are insignificant in the other regions of BoB. Significant increase in AOD in the NWB and WCB regions is mainly contributed by dominant outflow of anthropogenic emissions from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) area of Indian subcontinent. The magnitude of AOD decreased by half from northern BoB to equatorial region due to increase in distance from the source region. The contribution of anthropogenic AOD was >70% to total AOD with higher contribution during winter and lower during summer. The rate of increase in both total and anthropogenic AOD was close to 0.104 and 0.099 per decade in the NWB and 0.069 and 0.059 per decade in the WCB region between 2001 and 2019. The rate of increase in total and anthropogenic AOD decreased from 2001-2009 (0.164 and 0.115 per decade respectively) to 2010-2019 (0.068 and 0.076 per decade respectively) in the NWB region. Significant increase in anthropogenic AOD by 50 and 30% was observed during El Nino and La Nina periods respectively than normal year in both northwest BoB (NWB) and western coastal (WCB) regions due to change in strength and direction of winds. Although some fraction of anthropogenic AOD is found over the entire BoB, significant rate of increase in anthropogenic AOD is found only about 23% of the area of BoB than hitherto reported as entire BoB. The impact of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic aerosols on biogeochemical processes, such as primary production and ocean acidification, needs further evaluation.

TI  - GLC_FCS30: global land-cover product with fine classification system at 30m using time-series Landsat imagery
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Over past decades, a lot of global land-cover products have been released; however, these still lack a global land-cover map with a fine classification system and spatial resolution simultaneously. In this study, a novel global 30m land-cover classification with a fine classification system for the year 2015 (GLC_FCS30-2015) was produced by combining time series of Landsat imagery and high-quality training data from the GSPECLib (Global Spatial Temporal Spectra Library) on the Google Earth Engine computing platform. First, the global training data from the GSPECLib were developed by applying a series of rigorous filters to the CCI_LC (Climate Change Initiative Global Land Cover) land-cover and MCD43A4 NBAR products (MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance). Secondly, a local adaptive random forest model was built for each 5 degrees x 5 degrees geographical tile by using the multi-temporal Landsat spectral and texture features and the corresponding training data, and the GLC_FCS30-2015 land-cover product containing 30 land-cover types was generated for each tile. Lastly, the GLC_FCS30-2015 was validated using three different validation systems (containing different land-cover details) using 44 043 validation samples. The validation results indicated that the GLC_FCS30-2015 achieved an overall accuracy of 82.5% and a kappa coefficient of 0.784 for the level-0 validation system (9 basic land-cover types), an overall accuracy of 71.4% and kappa coefficient of 0.686 for the UN-LCCS (United Nations Land Cover Classification System) level1 system (16 LCCS land-cover types), and an overall accuracy of 68.7% and kappa coefficient of 0.662 for the UN-LCCS level-2 system (24 fine land-cover types). The comparisons against other land-cover products (CCI_LC, MCD12Q1, FROM_GLC, and GlobeLand30) indicated that GLC_FCS30-2015 provides more spatial details than CCI_LC-2015 and MCD12Q1-2015 and a greater diversity of land-cover types than FROM_GLC-2015 and GlobeLand30-2010. They also showed that GLC_FCS30-2015 achieved the best overall accuracy of 82.5% against FROM_GLC-2015 of 59.1% and GlobeLand30-2010 of 75.9 %. Therefore, it is concluded that the GLC_FCS30-2015 product is the first global land-cover dataset that provides a fine classification system (containing 16 global LCCS land-cover types as well as 14 detailed and regional land-cover types) with high classification accuracy at 30 m. The GLC_FCS30-2015 global land-cover products produced in this paper are free access at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3986872 (Liu et al., 2020).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution of Aerosol Optical Depth Based on Landsat Data in the Hinterland of the Guanzhong Basin and Its Relationship with Urbanization
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the most fundamental optical properties of aerosols that characterizes the attenuation of light by aerosols and is an indicator of regional air pollution. Based on the blue band surface reflectance database from the MOD09A1 products for the period 2000-2019 and the ASTER spectral database, AOD was estimated from Landsat TM/OLI data using the deep blue algorithm (DB). Multi-year average/annual average and seasonal AOD values for the period 2000-2019 were then calculated to analyze the spatial characteristics and temporal variations of AOD using the empirical orthogonal function method (EOF). Furthermore, the impacts of urbanization on the spatio-temporal distribution of AOD were analyzed. The obtained results are summarized as follows: (1) The multi-year average AOD spatial distribution in the hinterland of the Guanzhong Basin was significantly affected by topography and human activities, with higher AOD values and variationsin areas of low altitude and high-intensity human activities compared to the surrounding mountains. Thus, changes in AOD in the study area are mainly affected by anthropogenic factors. AOD also showed significant seasonal variations, whereby spring (0.34) > summer (0.33) > autumn (0.23) > winter (0.12), and the largest regional differences occurred in summer; (2) The annual average AOD (from 2000-2019) showed the trend of "increase-decrease-increase", and reached a maximum in 2005, with the high AOD area gradually moving to the south. The distribution of AOD values in spring and summer was relatively discrete, while it is in a low-value agglomeration state in winter; (3) Three main AOD spatial distribution modes were identified based on the EOF, which had cumulative contribution rate of 83.0%. The spatial distribution trend of AOD showed regional consistency, with feature vectors consistent with the altitude, thus reflecting the difference of AOD at different altitudes. Taking the Qinling Mountains as the dividing line, the AOD presented the "north-south" pattern, AOD showed a "north-south" pattern, reflecting the uniqueness of the regional development in the Guanzhong Basin compared to the southern Qinling Mountains. The "southeast-northwest" distribution pattern indicated that the AOD presented a reverse change trend between urban and non-urban; and (4) The results of correlation analysis between the AOD and urbanization revealed a positive correlation with permanent population density (R-2=0.707, P<0.05), impervious surface density (R-2=0.377, P<0.05), and industrial POI density (R-2=0.727, P<0.5). These results are significant for improving the monitoring of air quality in the Guanzhong Basin and for the construction of an urban ecological environment.

TI  - Long-term outcome and axillary recurrence in elderly women (>70 years) with breast cancer: 10-years follow-up from a matched cohort study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: The oncological benefit of axillary surgery (AS), with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary dissection (ALND), in elderly women affected by breast cancer (BC) is controversial. We evaluated AS trends over a 10-year follow-up period as well as locoregional and survival outcomes in this subset of patients.Methods: Patients aged 70 years or older, treated between 1994 and 2008, were selected and divided in two groups, depending on whether or not AS was performed. A (1:1) matched analysis for all relevant clinicopathological features was performed. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox-proportional hazard ratio analysis.Results: A total of 1.748 patients were identified and stratified by age (70-74, 75-79, 80-84). A matched analysis was performed for 252 patients: 122 who underwent AS and 122 who did not. At 10-year followup, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, distant metastasis and contralateral BC were similar, p = 0.83, p = 0.42 and p = 0.28, respectively. In the no-AS group, a significant increased risk of axillary lymph node recurrence was identified at 5-and confirmed at 10-years (p = 0.038), without impact on overall survival at 5-and 10-years (p = 0.52). In the non-AS group, higher rate of axillary recurrence at 10-years was observed in patients with poorly differentiated (24.1%, 95% CI 7.2-46.2), highly proliferative (Ki67 > 20%: 17.1%, 95% CI 0.6-33.3) and luminal B tumors (16.8%, 95% CI 5.9-35.5).Conclusions: Axillary staging in elderly women does not impact long-term survival. Tailoring surgery according to tumor biology and age may improve locoregional outcome.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd, BASO The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - I Am Not Represented Here: Cultural Frameworks and Indigenous Methodology Primer for Postsecondary Settings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to share approaches for Indigenous students who are novice researchers at post-secondary settings in finding space and culturally relevant ways of representing their worldview in research through Indigenous methodologies and cultural frameworks. While there may be some similarities between Indigenous methodologies and Western qualitative research approaches, there are obvious cultural differences. This article presents an example of an Indigenous Maori centered approach and examples of Aboriginal approaches using Indigenous research methodology through cultural frameworks that may have relevance to both Indigenous students and non-Indigenous allies who support them on their research journey.

TI  - Investigating and modelling ground settlement response to groundwater dynamic variation in parts of Lagos using space-based retrievals
T2  - SOLID EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground settlement has impacted many infrastructures in Lagos. Rapid urbanisation has further compounded this problem. Monitoring and modelling of ground settlement will provide actionable information that can help to mitigate this problem. In this study, space-based retrievals were used to investigate the magnitude and spatial distribution of ground settlement and the role of groundwater depletion in Lagos. Using the SBAS technique, the ground settlement rates were computed based on the Sentinel-1 data acquired between 2015-2019. The GRACE-derived groundwater head changes between 2002-2017 was quantified, and the ground settlement response to groundwater depletion was modelled. The highest recorded groundwater depletion rate was -11 mm/year, while the highest observed ground settlement rate was -94 mm/year, indicating an intense rate of ground settlement up to the end of 2019. The statistical correlation between ground settlement and groundwater head changes is in the order of 0.4, which is a moderate positive correlation indicating a partial correlation between ground settlement and groundwater depletion. To model settlement, a one-dimensional approach was used to simulate the response of ground settlement to changes in groundwater level. The simulated results fairly correspond to the magnitude of observed settlement, confirming that factors other than groundwater depletion partly control ground settlement in Lagos.

TI  - Is the Universe Indifferent? Should We Care
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientific worldview is often claimed to reveal a universe chillingly indifferent to human suffering. But it's unclear what it means to describe the universe as indifferent, or what a non-indifferent universe would be like. I suggest that the relevant contrast isn't simply that between God and His absence, nor is the complaint about indifference focused on the lack of a kind of cosmic concern. At its heart is the idea of a mismatch between world and value. Although the causal forces governing our world are 'blind', they nevertheless do partly align with value. Still, our world is so arranged that senseless suffering is depressingly common, and the rosy non-indifferent counterfactual won't contain such evil. I argue, however, that it is a mistake to long for such an alternative: it must either involve an upside-down moral order, or would be a world from which we, and those who senselessly suffer, will be absent.

TI  - The first national scale spatial and temporal analysis of surface CO<sub>2</sub> over South Africa utilising satellite retrievals
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa is the dominant continental source region of CO2 fossil fuel emissions. This is a result of the strong dependence of its economy on fossil fuels. However, the observations of atmospheric CO2 in South Africa are inadequate. The country has the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Cape Point station as the only site with long-term ambient CO2 monitoring record. In this study, satellite data retrieved from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument on board the Aura satellite from Dec 2004 to Dec 2009 is used for the first time to quantify the spatial distribution of CO2 over South Africa, as well as to determine its annual variability at selected sites. The study found that the surface CO2 foot print in South Africa resembles the industrial CO2 emission sources spatial distribution, particularly during the summer and autumn. In winter and spring seasons the surface CO2 foot prints are spatially expanded as a result of contributions of emissions from biomass and domestic fossil fuel combustion. The surface levels of CO2 at the study areas have been increasing during the period of the analysis.

TI  - Effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy on upper limb function in women with early breast cancer: A systematic review of clinical trials
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - ABSTR A C T Purpose: Axillary surgery is still essential in the management of early breast cancer. Conservative pro-cedures like sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are less invasive than the traditional axillary node dissection (ALND). However, some extent of ipsilateral upper limb dysfunction might still occur. This systematic review aimed to describe the incidence of lymphedema, pain, sensory, and motor disorders after SLNB in women with early breast cancer. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. The search was performed on Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHAL, and Web of Science. The search was based on the following concepts: breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary dissection, upper limb complications. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Rob 2.0 toll.Results: We obtained 979 unique registries from the primary search and 381 additional records from the included articles' reference lists. Fifty-one articles were assessed as full text. Nine studies were included in the review. A total of 5161 patients undergone SLNB, and 4110 patients were assessed for ipsilateral arm complications. Six months after the surgery, 0-11% of patients presented lymphedema, 11-16% pain, 2-22% sensory disorders, and 0-9% motor disorders.Conclusions: SLNB was associated with persistent postoperative complications. The burden of compli-cations, although lower when compared to ALND, should not be ignored.

TI  - Sentinel Nodal Metastasis Detection in Endometrial Carcinoma With Microcystic, Elongated, and Fragmented (MELF) Pattern by Cytokeratin Immunostaining A Recommendation for Routine Processing Protocols
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) pattern of myoinvasion in endometrial carcinoma (EC) is associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastasis. Our aim is to assess the role of cytokeratin immunohistochemical (IHC) stains in detecting sentinel nodal metastasis in MELF pattern tumors.Methods: We recovered 19 MELF pattern EC hysterectomies with lymphadenectomy from our files. Negative nodes were subjected to cytokeratin AE1/AE3 IHC. Ten additional cases with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies primarily assessed by IHC were also analyzed.Results: Of the 19 cases of EC, 6 had positive lymph nodes based on H&E-stained sections at the time of their initial diagnosis. With the addition of IHC stains, 8 previously negative cases were found to have node metastases, and 3 of these were SLNs. Among the 10 cases primarily assessed by IHC, 5 had malignant cells in their SLNs.Conclusions: Cytokeratin IHC staining detected malignant cells in 9 of 16 cases with SLNs in our sample of women with MELF pattern of myoinvasion. Immunohistochemical stains should be routinely performed on SLNs from all MELF-positive cases to detect occult lymph node metastases and isolated tumor cells.

TI  - The Cultivation of Parent and Child Materialism: A Parent-Child Dyadic Study
T2  - HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research has shown that television viewing cultivates a materialistic worldview in children. However, other socialization factors may also influence children's materialism. The current research tests two socialization pathways of parental influence: (a) an indirect path in which parents pass on their own materialism to their children, and the parent's materialism is at least partly the result of a parent cultivation effect (parent cultivation); (b) an indirect path in which parents pass on their television viewing behavior to their children, which in turn positively predicts the children's level of materialism (child cultivation). The results of two studies (initial study plus direct replication, N=818) of U.S. parent-child dyads with 14- to 17-year-old children support the first path but not the second: The relation between parent TV viewing and child materialism is mediated through parent materialism. Child TV viewing is positively correlated with child materialism, but is nonsignificant when parent materialism is controlled.

TI  - Performance Comparison of Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor Models Using MOD16A2 Remote Sensing Product
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate a performance comparison for estimating satellite-based actual evapotranspiration (AET) using the Penman-Monteith (PM) and Priestley-Taylor (PT) approaches and to create a spatial AET map in an ungauged sub-humid tropical river basin. A few studies have compared the PM and PT model performance with a MODIS evapotranspiration data product (MOD16A2). Estimated AET values by the PT approach (AET(PT)), PM model with aerodynamic conductance (Ga) computed using the Leuning equation (AET(PM)), and Ga computed using the Choudhury equation (AET(PMCH)) were extracted for each of the 304 pixels for each day, and pixelwise comparisons were made with the corresponding MOD16A2 AET estimates for validation. As shown by the low RMSE values (0.19-0.23 mm/day), the PM model suggested in this analysis with Ga computed using the (AET(PMCH)) equation turned out to be the better model. Also, using the (AET(PMCH)) equation significantly reduced PBIAS values for all days examined. Topography, land use and land cover (LU/LC), temperature, and moisture availability conditions appear to influence AET variations across the basin. For the eight total Julian days in summer and winter for selected wet (2007) and dry (2012) years the for period 2006-2017, pixelwise maps depicting spatial variability were developed using MATLAB for the AET(PMCH) approach for selected available cloud-free MODIS image data.

T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ships and icebergs are similar in size and intensity in SAR images, so it is difficult to distinguish them in remote sensing images. Deep learning is a technique based on neural networks, which has played an important role in image information processing. In order to address the challenge of ship and iceberg classification, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification method for iceberg and ship discrimination from Sentinel-1 SAR images with different polarizations and incidence angles. The method is based on the fixed constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector and the CNN model has three input channels, then the model was trained using parallel algorithm. The CNN is trained using 1443 images and tested using 161 images. The CNN model is also compared with support vector machine (SVM) and k nearest neighbors (kNN) using the same dataset. Comparison shows the CNN-based method performs the best, and it achieved a validation accuracy of 96%.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in developing countries like India are the real drivers of multi-sectoral growth. Temporal information acquired through geo-spatial technology helps in assessing the trends in urban growth. In this context, the urban growth is analyzed for Tamil Nadu State in India, during 2012-2016 using composite VIIRS DNB (Day and Night Band) Sensor Data acquired by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. These images depict the night time illumination of different features as digital numbers. The processed VIIRS images have been classified into five categories based on the level of illumination, with high illumination level indicating presence of built up. Change detection with respect to Urban built up of entire Tamil Nadu has been carried out at two levels viz., district wise and also along the corridors. Image processing techniques have been used for classification of two time data sets and GIS has been used for change detection analysis. Based on this analysis districts have been classified into three categories viz., more, medium and less developed districts. By comparing and assessing the different corridors, western corridor is observed to have more urban growth than other areas of Tamil Nadu. A similar trend is observed from thematic maps generated using IRS AWiFS data for the same period. The study has potentials to help the policy makers and planners in developing industrial estates, improving transportation facilities, planning new industrial developments and, many other activities.

TI  - Simultaneous monitoring of vegetation dynamics and wildlife activity with camera traps to assess habitat change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology and productivity drive resource use by wildlife. Vegetation dynamics also reveal patterns of habitat disturbance and recovery. Monitoring these fine-scale vegetation patterns over large spatiotemporal extents can be difficult, but camera traps (CTs) commonly used to survey wildlife populations also collect data on local habitat conditions. We used CTs (n = 73) from 2016 to 2019 to assess impacts of habitat change in a boreal landscape of northern Canada, where seismic lines for petroleum exploration disturbed wildlife habitat and prompted vegetation restoration efforts. First, we quantified vegetation dynamics from CTs, comparing them to satellite-based estimates that are typically used to monitor vegetation at broad spatial scales. We then used understory phenology and productivity estimated from CT time-lapse images to assess vegetation recovery on seismic lines. Finally, we related vegetation dynamics with the habitat use of three wildlife species: sandhill cranes Grus canadensis, woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus, and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. CTs provided unique insight into vegetation dynamics that were different from signals measured by satellites, with temporally inconsistent and even some negative correlations between CT and satellite metrics. We found some indication of vegetation recovery on seismic lines that had received restoration treatment, with understory patterns more similar to undisturbed habitat than to seismic lines that did not receive restoration treatment. CTs also provided inferences about wildlife activity related to vegetation resources, which approaches using satellite data failed to detect. Wildlife habitat use tracked vegetation phenology, but did not always increase with vegetation productivity at weekly, 16-day, or annual intervals. Instead, associations with vegetation productivity depended on species, temporal scale, and productivity metrics. Given the widespread and growing use of CTs to monitor terrestrial wildlife, we recommend their use to simultaneously monitor habitat conditions to better understand the mechanisms that govern wildlife habitat use in changing environments.

TI  - Carbon stock estimation by dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and forest inventory data in a Mediterranean forest landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in mitigating global climate change by forming massive carbon sinks. Their carbon stocks and stock changes need to be quantified for carbon budget balancing and international reporting schemes. However, direct sampling and biomass weighing may not always be possible for quantification studies conducted in large forests. In these cases, indirect methods that use forest inventory information combined with remote sensing data can be beneficial. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images offer numerous opportunities to researchers as freely distributed remote sensing data. This study aims to estimate the amount of total carbon stock (TCS) in forested lands of the Kizildag Forest Enterprise. To this end, the actual storage capacities of five carbon pools, i.e. above- and below-ground, deadwood, litter, and soil, were calculated using the indirect method based on ground measurements of 264 forest inventory plots. They were then associated with the backscattered values from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Finally, TCS was separately modelled and mapped. The best regression model was developed using the HH polarization of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 with an adjusted R-2 of 0.78 (p < 0.05). According to the model, the estimated TCS was about 2 Mt for the entire forest, with an average carbon storage of 133 t ha(-1). The map showed that the distribution of TCS was heterogenic across the study area. Carbon hotspots were mostly composed of pure stands of Anatolian black pine and mixed, over-mature stands of Lebanese cedar and Taurus fir. It was concluded that the total carbon stocks of forest ecosystems could be estimated using appropriate SAR images at acceptable accuracy levels for forestry purposes. The use of additional ancillary data may provide more delicate and reliable estimations in the future. Given the implications of this study, the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon can be effectively controlled by forest management when coupled with easily accessible space-borne radar data.

TI  - Improving terrestrial evapotranspiration estimation across China during 2000-2018 with machine learning methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) accurately at various temporal and spatial scales is crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle and water resource management. The currently available ET estimates have some uncertainties and need to be further improved. In this study, six machine learning methods including the random forests, support vector machine, Gaussian process regression (GPR), ensemble trees, general regression neural network, and Bayesian Model Averaging, are applied and evaluated to improve China terrestrial ET estimation by integrating five process-based ET algorithms including SEMI-PM, RS-PM, RRS-PM, MOD16, and PMLv2. Then evaluations are conducted with the eddy covariance flux observations at 14 China flux tower sites distributing in forest, shrub, wetland, grassland, and cropland, as well as with water balance-based ET at basin scale. According to the multiple training, validation, and testing, the GPR method is superior to all the other methods. Compared with the individual algorithms, the GPR method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.45 mm day(-1) (for SEMI-PM) similar to 0.81 mm day(-1) (for PMLv2), improve the coefficient of determination (R-2) by 0.061 (for PMLv2) similar to 0.33 (for MOD16), and decrease the absolute relative percent error (RPE) by 8.32% (for RS-PM) similar to 42.47% (for PMLv2) for all the test data. At basin scale, the results demonstrate that the annual GPR-merged China terrestrial ET is reliable (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 57.18 mm year RPE = -0.26%) and has higher accuracy than the currently available eight high-resolution ET products and the estimates from the other five machine learning methods and the five single ET models. The annual average terrestrial ET across China for 2000-2018 estimated by the GPR method is approximately 397.65 mm year More ground-based observations of terrestrial ET covering various land types should be collected to update the integrating methods and improve ET estimates. The resultant China terrestrial ET product with a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km and 10 days (ChinaET 1 km 10days) produced by the GPR method is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.fighare.12278684.v5.

AB  - This paper devises a set of simple and practical method for interpreting hundreds of free medium-resolution satellite images to study beach evolution. The method focuses on beach transects, integrates the computeraided and subpixel recognition technologies, and derives multiple shoreline indicators and historical beach profile shape. This paper also introduces how to use the method with a case study. The case study uses 880 Landsat images from 1984 to 2020 to examine the historical evolution of the complex Haiyang Beach in China as well as its responses to onshore and offshore engineering projects.The results not only show the detailed temporal and spatial changes of the upper beach based on dry/wet and high-water lines, but also the changes of the middle and lower beach based on mean-water, low-water, and low boundary lines, as well as the changes of beach profile shape, beach slope, and intertidal width. The random errors of the dry/wet, high-water, mean-water, and low-water lines are 7.8 m, 10.5 m, 15.9 m, and 19.2 m, respectively. The random errors not only result from the geo-reference process of satellite images and the recognition process of shoreline positions, but are also affected by random water level fluctuations and irregular undulations of the beach profile. This paper also discusses the similarities, differences, and applicability of these shoreline indicators. It is found that the evolution of dry/wet and high-water lines are similar and mainly affected by onshore engineering projects while the evolution of mean-water, low-water, and low boundary lines are similar and mainly affected by offshore engineering projects.The method provided in this paper can comprehensively evaluate beach evolution based on free satellite images, and would be helpful for understanding and protection of the beaches affected by intensified or intensifying engineering projects and human activities.

TI  - ON WHITE THEOLOGY . . . AND OTHER LIES: REDEMPTIVE COMMUNAL NARRATIVE IN TONI MORRISON'S <i>BELOVED</i>
T2  - LITERATURE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Toni Morrison's Beloved can be read as a decidedly theological work, particularly in its expression of redemptive communal unity through narrative re-telling. Morrison's imagined community in Beloved moves from fragmented isolation to liberative solidarity with each other, dramatically exemplifying a postcolonial theological vision, which draws from African traditional cultures. Although often rejected by some theological interpreters as 'pop-gnostic', Toni Morrison's Beloved rejects a theological worldview of coloniality and offers instead a hybridised approach to theological meaning. In dispelling the racial 'othering' that frequently occurs in both literature and theology, Morrison crafts a theological narrative that retells the sinful past in the hope of transcending guilt for the sake of a harmonious future. Thus, the theological insight of Beloved is found in a syncretic cosmology that does not perpetuate colonial ontological categories but forges a communal narrative that is non-possessive and open to a future free from the shackles of the past. Morrison's Beloved equips the theologian with pertinent questions, ones that wrestle with the presence of God within a suffering and oppressed community; these are timely questions that must be posed to the Christian tradition in order to transcend the lies of white theology.

TI  - Long-term monitoring and evaluation of land development in a reclamation area under rapid urbanization: A case-study in Qiantang New District, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land reclamation has occurred extensively worldwide to accommodate urbanization and economic development, especially in developing countries like China. However, we have a limited understanding of the long-term dynamics and key drivers of land use/cover change in the reclaimed area. In this study, we monitored the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of land reclamation from 1973 to 2018 in Qiantang New District using time-series LANDSAT and SENTINEL-2A images and then compared the differences of landscape changes between reclaimed, which are the new-built land from Qiantang River, and inland areas. Key findings include: (1) A significant decreasing trend for areas near the Qiantang River along the coastline (212.21 to 80.99 km(2)) and an increasing trend for constructed land (10.05 to 120.89 km(2)) from 1973 to 2018 was detected; (2) The development modes of the inland area and reclaimed area were significantly different. Development in the inland area was similar to other Chinese cities, whereas the reclaimed area was relatively complex with two main changing paths; and (3) Year 2008 was an important turning point in the perspective of urbanization in the study area. Before 2008, urbanization was random and uncontrolled. After 2008, new governance on land appeared and changed the landscape into a compact and uniform pattern. The proposed framework should reveal the detailed trajectory of land reclamation in small areas and provide insights and tools for better understanding the impact of human activities on the landscape pattern in coastal regions under rapid urbanization.

TI  - Multi-criteria modelling of drought: a study of Brandenburg Federal State, Germany
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is the absence or below-required supply of precipitation, runoff and or moisture for an extended time period. Modelling drought is relevant in assessing drought incidence and pattern. This study aimed to model the spatial variation and incidence of the 2018 drought in Brandenburg using GIS and remote sensing. To achieve this, we employed a Multi-Criteria Approach (MCA) by using three parameters including Precipitation, Land Surface Temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We acquired the precipitation data from Deutsche Wetterdienst, Land Surface Temperature and NDVI from Landsat 8 imageries on the USGS Earth Explorer. The datasets were analyzed using ArcGIS 10.7. The information from these three datasets was used as parameters in assessing drought prevalence using the MCA. The MCA was used in developing the drought model, 'PLAN', which was used to classify the study area into three levels/zones of drought prevalence: moderate, high and extreme drought. We went further to quantify the agricultural areas affected by drought in the study area by integrating the land use map. Results revealed that 92% of the study area was severely and highly affected by drought especially in districts of Oberhavel, Uckermark, Potsdam-Staedte, and Teltow-Flaeming. Finding also revealed that 77.54% of the total agricultural land falls within the high drought zones. We advocated for the application of drought models (such as 'PLAN'), that incorporates flexibility (tailoring to study needs) and multi-criteria (robustness) in drought assessment. We also suggested that adaptive drought management should be championed using drought prevalence mapping.

TI  - The role of axillary reverse mapping in intraoperative nodal palpation during sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative nodal palpation in the axilla is a mandatory part of sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, there is no consensus regarding the definition of suspicious palpable node. The sampling rate and involvement rate of suspicious palpable nodes are inconsistent. We hypothesized that axillary reverse mapping is helpful to select suspicious palpable sentinel lymph nodes more accurately. Patients with clinically negative nodes underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with intraoperative nodal palpation and axillary reverse mapping. Blue and hot nodes were removed as sentinel lymph nodes. Suspicious palpable nodes that were neither blue nor hot were removed as palpable sentinel lymph nodes. Nodes around blue and hot sentinel lymph node were incidentally removed as para-sentinel lymph nodes. Fluorescent nodes were considered axillary reverse mapping nodes. Patients with positive sentinel lymph node underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Palpable sentinel lymph nodes and para-sentinel lymph nodes were removed in 130 (15%) of 850 patients with clinically negative nodes. Although palpable sentinel lymph nodes and para-sentinel lymph nodes were involved in 19 (15%) of 130 patients, fluorescent palpable sentinel lymph nodes were involved only in 2 patients and fluorescent para-sentinel lymph nodes were not involved. When excluding fluorescent palpable sentinel lymph nodes and para-sentinel lymph nodes, the sampling rate of suspicious palpable nodes significantly decreased (15% vs. 5%, p < 0.01) and the involvement rate of palpable sentinel lymph nodes significantly increased (15% vs. 31%, p < 0.05). Axillary reverse mapping is helpful to avoid an unnecessary removal of palpable nodes without metastases.

TI  - Urbanization and its effects on water resources: Scenario of a tropical river basin in South India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Karamana River Basin (KRB), set in the tropical monsoon climate (i.e., Koppen's Am), hosts the drinking water supply to the capital city of Thiruvanathapuram, one of the highly urbanized cities in the southwestern seaboard of India. Primary focus of the study is a scrutiny of future water security status of KRB, amidst the rising population and subsequent urban sprawl. The study was done through a combination of analysis of remotely sensed data, and collation of data on population growth, surface water distribution and decadal-level groundwater monitoring. An uptrend of the decadal-level population and unscientific constructions across KRB led to the decline of per capita water entitlement and causing conflicts around water service delivery. So this study has an imperative focus on the effects of rapidly growing urban life and its impact on water resources in KRB. This was accomplished by studying the land use, land surface temperature (LST), annual precipitation, and groundwater trend for two decades, followed by land use modeling and quantifying total water deposit. The estimated LST values in KRB, robustly substantiate an upward shift in surface temperature between 2001 (47.55%) to 2020 (64.01%), a testimony of urban sprawl and it may be the major cause to reduce the rate of rainwater infiltration and increase in runoff. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), used to generate land use map, and LST of the basin have been assessed for the years 2001, 2011, and 2020 to model whether or not land use has been modulated by urbanization. Based on this, future trends of land use changes for 2030 and 2050 have been predicted using CA-Markov model - a model combining Cellular Automata and Markov chain. We also carried out a quantification of annual water deposit, potential evapo-transpiration, infiltration, surface runoff, and storage. Decadal trends of population change, degree of urbanization and consequent rise in domestic water demand and shrinkage of area of open space/soil cover have also been factored in assessing water security in KRB. The results show that, as of today, the city is facing an acute annual shortage of surface water by 321.51 MCM. Furthermore, we propose potential sources for future water security of the state's capital region.

TI  - Shifting cultivation, soil degradation, and agricultural land-use planning in the northeastern hill region of India using geo-spatial techniques
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation is widely practiced in the northeastern hill (NEH) region of India. It is known that the destruction of natural forests and its conversion to cropland leads to soil resource degradation. The impacts on soil due to jhuming (jhum practice followed in shifting cultivation) have not been studied adequately. Also, study of alternatives to jhum land use is lacking. In our study, a soil resource inventory of jhum lands was generated for a part of the Purvanchal Ranges of Eastern Himalaya, India to ascertain the nature of soil resource degradation due to jhuming using geo-spatial techniques. High-resolution IRS P6 LISS-IV and stereo-pair CARTOSAT-I satellite images along with digital elevation model data were used to map soil resources of jhum lands through a detailed soil survey. Typical pedons were also studied in the native forest adjacent to the jhum lands. Further, land suitability evaluation of the identified soil series for crop growth was carried out to propose alternative land-use models for jhum lands distributed over different landforms. Results indicated that soils of jhum lands were organically degraded and followed regressive pedogenesis, whereas forest soils followed progressive pedogenesis, particularly on high (650-1250 masl) and medium hills (250-650 masl). Alternaive land-use models with the inclusion of upland rice and without the inclusion of rice have been proposed. Results of the investigation should be useful for policy makers to seeking make the best use of the land resources under jhum cultivation.

TI  - A simplified subsurface soil salinity estimation using synergy of SENTINEL-1 SAR and SENTINEL-2 multispectral satellite data, for early stages of wheat crop growth in Rupnagar, Punjab, India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity has become a highly disastrous phenomenon responsible for crop failure worldwide, especially in countries with low farmer incomes and food insecurity. Soil salinity is often due to water accumulation in fields caused by improper flood irrigation whereby plants take up the water leaving salts behind. It is, however, the subsurface soil salinity that affects plant growth. This soil salinity prevents further water intake. There have been very few studies conducted for subsurface soil salinity estimation. Therefore our study aimed to estimate subsurface soil salinity (at 60 cm depth) for the early stage of wheat crop growth in a simplified manner using freely available satellite data, which is a novel feature and prime objective in this study. The study utilises SENTINEL-1 SAR (synthetic aperture RADAR) data for backscatter coefficient generation, SENTINEL-2A multispectral data for NDSI (normalised differential salinity index) generation and on-ground equipment for direct collection of soil electrical conductivity (EC). The data were collected for two dates in November and December 2019 and one date in January 2020 during the early stage of wheat crop growth. The dates were selected keeping in mind the satellite pass over the study area of Rupnagar on the same day. Ordinary least squares regression was used for modelling which gave R-2-statistics of 0.99 and 0.958 in the training and testing phase and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.92 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.78 in modelling for soil salinity estimation.

TI  - NGTS-19b: a high-mass transiting brown dwarf in a 17-d eccentric orbit
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the discovery of NGTS-19b, a high-mass transiting brown dwarf discovered by the Next Generation Transit Survey. We investigate the system using follow-up photometry from the South African Astronomical Observatory, as well as sector 11 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, in combination with radial velocity measurements from the CORALIE spectrograph to precisely characterize the system. We find that NGTS-19b is a brown dwarf companion to a K-star, with a mass of M-Jup and radius of R-Jup. The system has a reasonably long period of 17.84 d, and a high degree of eccentricity of . The mass and radius of the brown dwarf imply an age of Gyr, however, this is inconsistent with the age determined from the host star spectral energy distribution, suggesting that the brown dwarf may be inflated. This is unusual given that its large mass and relatively low levels of irradiation would make it much harder to inflate. NGTS-19b adds to the small, but growing number of brown dwarfs transiting main-sequence stars, and is a valuable addition as we begin to populate the so-called brown dwarf desert.

TI  - Land-use dynamics associated with mangrove deforestation for aquaculture and the subsequent abandonment of ponds
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of large area mangrove deforestation, aquaculture pond building, and the subsequent abandonment of ponds in a large delta in Indonesia, namely the Mahakam Delta. So, we developed and applied a novel methodology for exploring the lifespan of aquaculture ponds. Using historical multispectral and radar data, the lifespans of aquaculture ponds across the delta were estimated via a chronological analysis of the landscape into four different states: primary mangroves deforested mangroves ponds abandoned/inactive ponds. Specifically, a combination of sequential classifica-tion and rule-based techniques were used to: 1) produce a time series of land cover maps from 1994 to 2015 and 2) quantify lifespans of aquaculture ponds in the delta. Results show that of the 110,000 ha of primary mangrove forests in the delta in 1994, 62% had been deforested by 2015, with a 4.5% annual rate of loss on average. The lifespan of aquaculture ponds in the delta varied between 1 and 22+ years, with most of the ponds having productive lifespans of 10 to 13 years. Ponds with relatively longer lifespans were located near the existing settlements in the delta. This study showed that the productive lifespan of most aquaculture ponds in deforested mangrove lands of Mahakam delta is relatively short, information that should be useful for developing appropriate management plans for the delta or similar coastal mangrove ecosystems. The abandoned ponds can potentially be rehabilitated for shrimp and fish production after applying appropriate restorative treatments or be targeted for mangrove restoration projects.

TI  - Development of Incidence and Surgical Treatment of Penile Cancer in Germany from 2006 to 2016: Potential Implications for Future Management
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Penile cancer is a rare disease and surgical treatment often entails a significant impact on quality of life. The aim of this study was to analyze trends in surgical treatment patterns in Germany. Methods We analyzed data from the nationwide German hospital billing database and the German cancer registry from 2006 to 2016. All penile cancer cases with penile surgery or lymph node dissection (LND) were included. We also analyzed the distribution of cases, extent of surgery, and length of hospital stay, stratified for annual caseload. The geographical distribution of centers for 2016 was presented. Results During the investigated timespan, tumor incidences increased from 748 to 971 (p = 0.001). We identified 11,353 penile surgery cases, increasing from 886 to 1196 (p < 0.001), and 5173 cases of LND, increasing from 332 to 590 (p < 0.001). Cases of partial amputation increased from 45.8 to 53.8% (p < 0.001), while total amputation remained stable at 11.2%. Caseload in high-volume hospitals increased from 9.0 to 18.8% for penile surgery (p < 0.001) and from 0 to 13.1% for LND (p < 0.001). The increase in LND caseload was caused by an increase in inguinal LND, from 297 to 505 (p < 0.001), with increasing sentinel LND, from 14.2 to 21.9% (p = 0.098). The assessment of geographical distribution of cases in Germany revealed extensive areas without sufficient coverage by experienced centers. Conclusions We saw consistent increases in penile surgery and LND, with a growing number of cases in high-volume hospitals, and, accordingly, an increase in tumor incidence. The increasing use of inguinal LND and organ-preserving surgery reflect the adaptation of current guidelines; however, geographical distribution of experienced centers could be improved.

TI  - Project Gradient Descent Adversarial Attack against Multisource Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification
T2  - SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning technology (a deeper and optimized network structure) and remote sensing imaging (i.e., the more multisource and the more multicategory remote sensing data) have developed rapidly. Although the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing image (RSI) scene classification, the existence of adversarial attacks poses a potential security threat to the RSI scene classification task based on CNN. The corresponding adversarial samples can be generated by adding a small perturbation to the original images. Feeding the CNN-based classifier with the adversarial samples leads to the classifier misclassify with high confidence. To achieve a higher attack success rate against scene classification based on CNN, we introduce the projected gradient descent method to generate adversarial remote sensing images. Then, we select several mainstream CNN-based classifiers as the attacked models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results show that our proposed method can dramatically reduce the classification accuracy under untargeted and targeted attacks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the quality of the generated adversarial images by visual and quantitative comparisons. The results show that our method can generate the imperceptible adversarial samples and has a stronger attack ability for the RSI scene classification.

TI  - Urban structure type mapping method using spatial metrics and remote sensing imagery classification
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Structure Types (USTs) stand for areas with homogeneous appearance over the urban matrix. The use of spatial metrics rises as a convenient alternative to quantify the homogeneity of areas on a specific scale. Remote sensing imagery is largely used to assess and study the urban environment, and its classification is a way to recreate the Earth's surface digitally, both natural and urban spaces. This study proposes a method for city-scale UST mapping using remote sensing images as the unique source of information. Such a proposal comprehends the classification of images that express spatial metrics derived from previous land use and land cover (LULC) classification. We carried two case studies to assess the proposed method under different image resolutions and urban complexity conditions. For this purpose, Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images acquired from different cities in Brazil are submitted to the proposed method. An alternative object-based image classification method is included as a comparison baseline. The proposed method shows efficiency in the UST mapping process, which is highly influenced by the neighborhood size considered over the process. Also, it is verified that the proposed method is superior at a significance level of 5%.

TI  - Comparison of empirical remote-sensing based models for the estimation of gross primary productivity using eddy covariance and satellite data over agroecosystem
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) is critical for global climate and ecological studies. However, the lack of multi-model studies for GPP estimation over agroecosystem in India limits the carbon budgeting at the regional scales. Satellite-derived parameters [(e.g., land surface temperature (LST), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)] combined with meteorological variables offer a promising tool for regional estimates of the GPP. In this study, site-specific GPP was evaluated based on the eddy-covariance (EC) tower data and satellite-derived parameters. Four satellite-based GPP models, (a) greenness and radiation (GR) model, (b) VI x VI model, (c) photosynthetic capacity model (PCM), and (d) temperature and greenness (TG) model have been compared for the estimation of GPP in Saharanpur Flux tower site (SFS) from April 2014 to April 2015 using meteorological variables from EC and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. Among the predictive GPP models, TG models performed best with the RMSE of 2.03 g C m(-2) day(-1). The relationship of MODIS-LST with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), GPP and air temperature (Ta) indicates that the climate variables are imperative for GPP estimation. In the VI x VI model series, the combination of EVI x EVI x PAR provided the best GPP estimates with an RMSE of 2.99 g C m(-2) day(-1). The comparative analysis of the GPP models has the potential for GPP estimates over agroecosystems and further carbon flux predictions at the regional scale.

TI  - Predicting pathological axillary lymph node status with ultrasound following neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose High-performing imaging and predictive markers are warranted to minimize surgical overtreatment of the axilla in breast cancer (BC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Here we have investigated whether axillary ultrasound (AUS) could identify axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis (ALNM) pre-NACT and post-NACT for BC. The association of tumor, AUS features and mammographic density (MD) with axillary-pathological complete response (axillary-pCR) post-NACT was also assessed. Methods The NeoDense-study cohort (N = 202, NACT during 2014-2019), constituted a pre-NACT cohort, whereas patients whom had a cytology verified ALNM pre-NACT and an axillary dissection performed (N = 114) defined a post-NACT cohort. AUS characteristics were prospectively collected pre- and post-NACT. The diagnostic accuracy of AUS was evaluated and stratified by histological subtype and body mass index (BMI). Predictors of axillary-pCR were analyzed, including MD, using simple and multivariable logistic regression models. Results AUS demonstrated superior performance for prediction of ALNM pre-NACT in comparison to post-NACT, as reflected by the positive predictive value (PPV) 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.97) and PPV 0.76 (95% CI 0.62-0.87), respectively. We found no difference in AUS performance according to neither BMI nor histological subtype. Independent predictors of axillary-pCR were: premenopausal status, ER-negativity, HER2-overexpression, and high MD. Conclusion Baseline AUS could, to a large extent, identify ALNM; however, post-NACT, AUS was insufficient to determine remaining ALNM. Thus, our results support the surgical staging of the axilla post-NACT. Baseline tumor biomarkers and patient characteristics were predictive of axillary-pCR. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the performance of AUS post-NACT.

TI  - Behavior and general design method of concrete-filled high-strength steel tube (CFHST) columns
T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) incorporating high-strength steel (HSS) could produce more efficient structural system with lighter weight and higher capacity. However, the design methods for applying concrete-filled highstrength steel tubes (CFHST) are not available yet and limited investigations had been reported. In this research, 8 full scale mid-slenderness circular CFHST specimens, made of innovative high-performance Q460qENH structural steel with actual yielding stress fy as high as 530 MPa, were tested subject to axial and eccentric compression. The main parameters considered in the experimental program included: (a) infilled concrete strength fc' = 39.8-75.3 MPa and (b) loading eccentricity ratio e/D = 0-0.3. The numerical model for CFHST was established and validated with load-displacement curves, failure modes and neutral axis locations obtained from the 8 experiments. The numerical models were further validated in capacity predictions with 232 axial compressions and compression-bending CFHST experimental data collected from the literature, proved to be generally applicable with fy = 435-835 MPa, xi = 0.5-8.5 and lambda n = 0.07-1.90 in both circular and square sections. Based on the validated numerical models, total 526 simulations were performed to investigate the influence of: (a) higher yielding strength fy and thinner-walled steel tubes; (b) confinement factor xi and (c) normalized slenderness ratio lambda n, on the composite strength fsc and compression-bending (N-M) interaction behavior. Experimental and numerical investigations showed that high strength steel could further improve the CFST capacity with basically no reduction in safety margin and ductility performance, but was in need of design method modifications due to changes in composite mechanism. On this basis, an analytical refined plastic-section equilibrium model (RPE model) was proposed to derive practical N-M interaction design curve with consideration of strength enhancement due to the composition and actual stress distribution at ultimate state. The further proposed general design method for compression-bending CFHST included: (a) formulas of fsc-xi relationship; (b) validated formulas of pure-bending capacity and overall stability inherited from GB 50936; (c) practical design curves of N-M interaction considering the effect of xi and lambda n. By comparing with GB 50936, AISC 360, EC 4 and CECS 28 provisions, the proposed method provided more accurate solutions in capacity predictions of CFHST members.

TI  - Social justice and action research: can we collaboratively create a new social movement with social justice at the centre?
T2  - EDUCATIONAL ACTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ideas about social justice are influenced by the ontological and epistemological assumptions of the worldview in which they are located. Since the seventeenth century, the dominant worldview in the western hemisphere has been shaped by the separatist and deterministic principles of classical Newtonian science. During the twentieth century, with the advent of quantum physics, these principles have been contested from within science itself, indicating that the universe may instead be inter-relational, entangled and participatory. A historical investigation demonstrates how, despite findings from modern science, the Newtonian worldview has become deeply embedded in the western psyche, including in neoliberal politics, education, and educational research. As a counter-narrative, an alternative worldview is proposed, which is grounded in the ontological assumption of a participatory consciousness, with implications for ethics and social justice. Supporting a call for the creation of a new story which negates the prevailing neoliberal narrative, I look at ways in which advocates of social justice can, using an integration of first, second and third person approaches to action research, collaboratively initiate a new social movement, with intellectual depth, and with social justice at its centre.

T2  - WAR & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf War (1990-1991) had a transformative effect on Saudi Arabia and its society. The war brought major ideological changes and allowed its citizens for the first time to voice critique and concern about economic and social problems. Many studies have highlighted the diverse reactions and dilemmas of Saudi people from the crumbling notion of Arab unity to the emergence of the United States to stop the looming invasion of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Although there is a plethora of studies about the Gulf War, none of them has investigated how ordinary Saudi citizens experienced the war with all its implications. The paper describes what narratives were used by interviewees in oral history interviews when talking about the war and its effect on their lives, families, and worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To develop and validate an International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)-based algorithm to identify cases of stillbirth using electronic healthcare data.Methods We conducted a retrospective study using claims data from three Data Partners (healthcare systems and insurers) in the Sentinel Distributed Database. Algorithms were developed using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to identify potential stillbirths among females aged 12-55 years between July 2016 and June 2018. A random sample of medical charts (N = 169) was identified for chart abstraction and adjudication. Two physician adjudicators reviewed potential cases to determine whether a stillbirth event was definite/probable, the date of the event, and the gestational age at delivery. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for the algorithms. Among confirmed cases, agreement between the claims data and medical charts was determined for the outcome date and gestational age at stillbirth.Results Of the 110 potential cases identified, adjudicators determined that 54 were stillbirth events. Criteria for the algorithm with the highest PPV (82.5%; 95% CI, 70.9%-91.0%) included the presence of a diagnosis code indicating gestational age >= 20 weeks and occurrence of either >1 stillbirth-related code or no other pregnancy outcome code (i.e., livebirth, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion) recorded on the index date. We found >= 90% agreement within 7 days between the claims data and medical charts for both the outcome date and gestational age at stillbirth.Conclusions Our results suggest that electronic healthcare data may be useful for signal detection of medical product exposures potentially associated with stillbirth.

TI  - AMPK activates Parkin independent autophagy and improves post sepsis immune defense against secondary bacterial lung infections
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Metabolic and bioenergetic plasticity of immune cells is essential for optimal responses to bacterial infections. AMPK and Parkin ubiquitin ligase are known to regulate mitochondrial quality control mitophagy that prevents unwanted inflammatory responses. However, it is not known if this evolutionarily conserved mechanism has been coopted by the host immune defense to eradicate bacterial pathogens and influence post-sepsis immunosuppression. Parkin, AMPK levels, and the effects of AMPK activators were investigated in human leukocytes from sepsis survivors as well as wild type and Park2(-/-) murine macrophages. In vivo, the impact of AMPK and Parkin was determined in mice subjected to polymicrobial intra-abdominal sepsis and secondary lung bacterial infections. Mice were treated with metformin during established immunosuppression. We showed that bacteria and mitochondria share mechanisms of autophagic killing/clearance triggered by sentinel events that involve depolarization of mitochondria and recruitment of Parkin in macrophages. Parkin-deficient mice/macrophages fail to form phagolysosomes and kill bacteria. This impairment of host defense is seen in the context of sepsis-induced immunosuppression with decreased levels of Parkin. AMPK activators, including metformin, stimulate Parkin-independent autophagy and bacterial killing in leukocytes from post-shock patients and in lungs of sepsis-immunosuppressed mice. Our results support a dual role of Parkin and AMPK in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria and killing of pathogenic bacteria, and explain the immunosuppressive phenotype associated Parkin and AMPK deficiency. AMPK activation appeared to be a crucial therapeutic target for the macrophage immunosuppressive phenotype and to reduce severity of secondary bacterial lung infections and respiratory failure.

TI  - A spatially explicit approach to simulate urban heat mitigation with InVEST (v3.8.0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigating urban heat islands has become an important objective for many cities experiencing heat waves. Despite notable progress, the spatial relationship between land use and/or land cover patterns and the distribution of air temperature remains poorly understood. This article presents a reusable computational workflow to simulate the spatial distribution of air temperature in urban areas from their land use and/or land cover data. The approach employs the InVEST urban cooling model, which estimates the cooling capacity of the urban fabric based on three biophysical mechanisms: tree shade, evapotranspiration and albedo. An automated procedure is proposed to calibrate the parameters of the model to best fit air temperature observations from monitoring stations. In a case study in Lausanne, Switzerland, spatial estimates of air temperature obtained with the calibrated model show that the urban cooling model outperforms spatial regressions based on satellite data. This represents two major advances in urban heat island modeling. First, unlike in black-box approaches, the calibrated parameters of the urban cooling model can be interpreted in terms of the physical mechanisms that they represent; therefore, they can help promote an understanding of how urban heat islands emerge in a particular context. Second, the urban cooling model requires only land use and/or land cover and reference temperature data and can, therefore, be used to evaluate synthetic scenarios such as master plans, urbanization prospects and climate scenarios. The proposed approach provides valuable insights into the emergence of urban heat islands which can serve to inform urban planning and assist the design of heat mitigation policies.

TI  - Subclinical Lymphedema After Treatment for Breast Cancer: Risk of Progression and Considerations for Early Intervention
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a devastating complication of breast cancer (BC) treatment. The authors hypothesized that identifying subclinical lymphedema (SCL) presents an opportunity to prevent BCRL development. They aimed to assess rates of SCL progression (relative volume change [RVC], 5-10%) to BCRL (RVC, >= 10%) in women undergoing axillary surgery for BC via axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods. Patients treated for BC were prospectively screened at preoperative baseline and throughout the follow-up period using the perometer. The cohort was stratified according to nodal surgery (ALND or SLNB) to analyze rates of progression to BCRL.Results. The study cohort included 1790 patients. Of the 1359 patients who underwent SLNB, 331 (24.4%) experienced SCL, with 38 (11.5%) of these patients progressing to BCRL. Of the 431 patients who underwent ALND, 171 (39.7%) experienced SCL, with 67 (39.2%) of these patients progressing to BCRL. Relative to the patients without SCL, those more likely to experience BCRL were the ALND patients with early SCL (< 3 months postoperatively; hazard ratio [HR], 2.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-4.27; p = 0.0002) or late SCL (>= 3 months postoperatively; HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.95-5.05; p < 0.0001) and the SLNB patients with early SCL (HR, 6.75; 95% CI, 3.8-11.98; p < 0.0001 or late SCL (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.65-5.50; p = 0.0003).Conclusion. The study suggests that patients with SCL after axillary nodal surgery for BC are more likely to progress to BCRL than those who do not experience SCL. This presents a tremendous opportunity for early intervention to prevent BCRL and improve the quality of life for women treated for BC.

TI  - Combining Snow Depth From FY-3C and <i>In Situ</i> Data Over the Tibetan Plateau Using a Nonlinear Analysis Method
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau plays a vital role in the regional and global climate system because it affects not only the climate but also the hydrological cycle and ecosystem. However, high-quality snow data are hindered due to the sparsity of observation networks and complex terrain in the region. In this study, a nonlinear time series analysis method called phase space reconstruction was used to obtain the Tibetan Plateau snow depth by combining the FY-3C satellite data and in situ data for the period 2014-2017. This method features making a time delay reconstruction of a phase space to view the dynamics. Both of the grids and their nearby in situ snow depth time series were reconstructed with two appropriate parameters called time delay and embedding dimension. The values of the snow depth for grids were averaged over the in situ observations and retrieval of the satellite if their two parameters were the same. That implies that the two trajectories of the time series had the same evolution trend. Otherwise, the snow depth values for grids were averaged over the in situ observation. If there were no in situ sites within the grids, the retrieval of the satellite remained. The results show that the integrated Tibetan Plateau snow depth (ITPSD) had an average bias of -1.35 cm and 1.14 cm, standard deviation of the bias of 3.96 cm and 5.67 cm, and root mean square error of 4.18 cm and 5.79 cm compared with the in situ data and FY-3C satellite data, respectively. ITPSD expressed the issue that snow depth is usually overestimated in mountain regions by satellites. This is due to the introduction of more station observations using a dynamical statistical method to correct the biases in the satellite data.

TI  - Mapping dynamic non-perennial stream networks using high-resolution distributed hydrologic simulation: A case study in the upper blue river basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half of all streams globally are non-perennial, and thus dynamic due to their expanding and retracting nature. Field mapping in conjunction with observational data from gauges and/or in-situ loggers is a typical approach for studying non-perennial stream dynamics, but these approaches underrepresent their spatiotemporal variability. High-resolution distributed hydrological modeling promises to bridge this gap, thanks to advances in model physics, remote sensing, and computational power. As the first step towards this goal, we investigate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture stream dynamics in Upper Blue River Basin, OK. Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST), a distributed hydrological model, is used to simulate spatiotemporally varied streamflow at 10-meter spatial resolution and daily time steps. USGS stream gauge data and insitu state logger data are used to calibrate and validate the simulation at the watershed outlet and small headwater tributaries, respectively. Dynamic Surface Water Estimate (DSWE), a LANDSAT product is also compared with simulated water presence in high-order streams. Results show that the CREST model can capture low-moderate streamflow values at the watershed outlet with a log-NSE value over 0.7 in the validation period, while underestimating high flow values due to the daily time step. Also, the calibrated model can accurately estimate wet/dry status as monitored by in-situ state loggers in nine headwater catchments. The dynamic stream networks are mapped over 2510 stream segments using the CREST simulation. Non-perennial streams are the most dynamic in small headwater tributaries (contributing area <2 km(2)) and high-order streams are sustained by perennial flow. As hydrologic interpretation of the stream dynamics, the interannual and seasonal variability in rainfall and evapotranspiration is well reflected by the water occurrence in streams. Across various catchments, a consistent threshold behavior is found between drainage density and unit discharge, indicating the control of runoff generation on the flowing stream networks. The mapping also identifies differences in stream dynamics caused by heterogeneities in land cover and soil properties. Given the prevalence of dynamical streams worldwide, our analysis illustrates the potential for mapping them using distributed hydrologic models.

TI  - Hospital-based sentinel surveillance for bacterial meningitis in under-five children prior to the introduction of the PCV13 in India
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: A hospital-based sentinel surveillance network for bacterial meningitis was established in India to estimate the burden of bacterial meningitis, and the proportion of major vaccine-preventable causative organisms. This report summarises the findings of the surveillance conducted between March 2012, and September 2016 in eleven hospitals.Methods: We enrolled eligible children with bacterial meningitis in the age group of one to 59 months. CSF samples were collected and processed for biochemistry, culture, latex agglutination, and real-time PCR. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.Results: Among 12 941 enrolled suspected meningitis cases, 586 (4.5%) were laboratory confirmed. S. pneumoniae (74.2%) was the most commonly detected pathogen, followed by H. influenzae (22.2%), and N. meningitidis (3.6%). Overall 58.1% of confirmed bacterial meningitis cases were children aged between one, and 11 months. H. influenzae meningitis cases had a high (12.3%) case fatality rate. The serotypes covered in PCV13 caused 72% pneumococcal infections, and the most common serotypes were 14 (18.3%), 6B (12.7%) and 19F (9.9%). Non-susceptibility to penicillin was 57%. Forty-five (43.7%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, of which 37 were PCV13 serotype isolates.Conclusions: The results are representative of the burden of bacterial meningitis among under-five children in India. The findings were useful in rolling out PCV in the National Immunization Program. The nonsusceptibility to penicillin and multidrug resistance was an important observation. Timely expansion of PCV across India will significantly reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance. Continued surveillance is needed to understand the trend after PCV expansion in India.

TI  - Investigating a Selection of Methods for the Prediction of Total Soluble Solids Among Wine Grape Quality Characteristics Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Data From Proximal and Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common method for determining wine grape quality characteristics is to perform sample-based laboratory analysis, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In this article, we investigate an alternative approach to predict wine grape quality characteristics by combining machine learning techniques and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data collected at different growth stages with non-destructive methods, such as proximal and remote sensing, that are currently used in precision viticulture (PV). The study involved several sets of high-resolution multispectral data derived from four sources, including two vehicle-mounted crop reflectance sensors, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired data, and Sentinel-2 (S2) archived imagery to estimate grapevine canopy properties at different growth stages. Several data pre-processing techniques were employed, including data quality assessment, data interpolation onto a 100-cell grid (10 x 20 m), and data normalization. By calculating Pearson's correlation matrix between all variables, initial descriptive statistical analysis was carried out to investigate the relationships between NDVI data from all proximal and remote sensors and the grape quality characteristics in all growth stages. The transformed dataset was then ready and applied to statistical and machine learning algorithms, firstly trained on the data distribution available and then validated and tested, using linear and nonlinear regression models, including ordinary least square (OLS), Theil-Sen, and the Huber regression models and Ensemble Methods based on Decision Trees. Proximal sensors performed better in wine grapes quality parameters prediction in the early season, while remote sensors during later growth stages. The strongest correlations with the sugar content were observed for NDVI data collected with the UAV, Spectrosense+GPS (SS), and the CropCircle (CC), during Berries pea-sized and the Veraison stage, mid-late season with full canopy growth, for both years. UAV and SS data proved to be more accurate in predicting the sugars out of all wine grape quality characteristics, especially during a mid-late season with full canopy growth, in Berries pea-sized and the Veraison growth stages. The best-fitted regressions presented a maximum coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.61.

TI  - Comparison of ammonia air concentration before and during the spread of COVID-19 in Lombardy (Italy) using ground-based and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several anthropogenic activities have undergone major changes following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn has had consequences on the environment. The effect on air pollution has been studied in detail in the literature, although some pollutants, such as ammonia (NH3), have received comparatively less attention to date. Focusing on the case of Lombardy in Northern Italy, this study aimed to evaluate changes in NH3 atmospheric concentration on a temporal scale (the years from 2013 to 2019 compared to 2020) and on a spatial scale (countryside, city, and mountain areas). For this purpose, ground-based (from public air quality control units scattered throughout the region) and satellite observations (from IASI sensors on board MetOp-A and MetOp-B) were collected and analyzed. For ground-based measurements, a marked spatial variability is observed between the different areas while, as regards the comparison between periods, statistically significant differences were observed only for the countryside areas (+31% in 2020 compared to previous years). The satellite data show similar patterns but do not present statistically significant differences neither between different areas, nor between the two periods. In general, there have been no reduction effects of atmospheric NH3 as a consequence of COVID-19. This calls into question the role of the agricultural sector, which is known to be the largest responsible for NH3 emissions. Even if the direct comparison between the two datasets shows little correlation, their contextual consideration allows making more robust considerations regarding air pollutants.

TI  - Evaluation of temporal dynamics of land use and land surface temperature (LST) in Agartala city of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study has been conducted at Agartala Municipal area (AMA) of Tripura, which exhibits rapid population growth and faster land use land cover changes. The major purpose of the study is to understand the dynamics of land use and Land surface temperature (LST) in the city of Agartala. The study incorporated satellite data such as Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and OLI (Operational Land Imager)/TIRS (Thermal Infra-Red Sensors) data along with LandScan datasets of the years from 2008 to 2018. The results revealed a drastic change of land use land cover specifically built up land with net change of 15.63 sq km. While during the same epoch, population portrayed a net growth of 250,017 in the city. The population induced change of land use land cover have accelerated the mean LST of the city from 25.71 oC to 26.29 oC in summer and 21.48 oC to 26.05 oC in winter season, respectively. The increasing strength of correlation between NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) &NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDBI&LST, NDVI&LST and finally Population density and LST with changing 'r' value from -0.46 to -0.89, 0.75 to 0.90,-0.76 to -0.81 and 0.34 and 0.67 in summer (2008-2018) whereas -0.34 to -0.83, 0.66 to 0.85, -0.56 to -0.78 and 0.35 to 0.50 in winter, respectively, signify the active role of population growth and built up land development on the intensification of the process of LST in the study area.

TI  - Human monocytes store and secrete preformed CCL5, independent of de novo protein synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monocytes are a subset of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with diverse roles in immunity, including sentinel roles in cytokine secretion. Conventionally, cytokines require an inductive stimulus for their expression and secretion, resulting in a time lag from the time of stimulation to when the proteins are packaged and secreted. Because cytokines are the main communicators in the immune system, their temporal expression is a key factor in coordinating responses to efficiently resolve infection. Herein, we identify that circulating human monocytes contain preformed cytokines that are stored intracellularly, in both resting and activated states. Having preformed cytokines bypasses the time lag associated with de novo synthesis, allowing monocytes to secrete immune mediators immediately upon activation or sensing of microbe-associated molecular patterns. We demonstrate here that, out of several cytokines evaluated, human monocytes contain a previously undescribed reservoir of the preformed chemokine CCL5. Furthermore, we showed that CCL5 could be secreted from monocytes treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) and Golgi blocker (brefeldin A). We examined the possibility for uptake of extracellular CCL5 from platelet aggregates and observed no significant levels of platelet binding to our enriched monocyte preparations, indicating that the source of preformed CCL5 was not from platelets. Preformed CCL5 was observed to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm and partially colocalized with CD63+ and Rab11A+ membranes, implicating endosomal compartments in the intracellular storage and trafficking of CCL5.

TI  - 'O doux miracle de nos mains vides !' The <i>renouveau catholique</i> in French cinema (Bernanos, Bresson, Beguin and Godard)
T2  - FRENCH SCREEN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ever since the 1950s, the Catholic novelist Georges Bernanos has exerted a particular influence on French cinema, both through the adaptations of his work by Robert Bresson and through his political writings, which Godard incorporated into films such as For Ever Mozart (1996). In this paper, the author aims to unearth this legacy of Bernanos in particular, and of the renouveau catholique, i.e. post-war Catholic revivalism, in general. What persists in French cinema is first and foremost an understanding of 'incarnationalist realism', a term the author derives from the literary critic Albert Beguin. This notion expresses a double ideal, namely that cinema is bound to 'sensuous appearances' and that it should reveal 'the inner life'. In the twentieth century Bernanos noticed a decline of the inner life, and of spirituality, which accounts for the presence of evil in his novels and the condemnation of 'the modern world' in his political writings. This worldview, I will argue, is key to understanding the cinema of Bresson and Godard. However culturally reactionary these filmmakers may have been, this worldview brought about an artistic revolution in cinema, as they reflected on the medium's specific potential to express the 'unsayable' - be it the presence of evil or the manifestation of Grace.

TI  - Korea-Japan relations through thick description: revisiting the national identity formation process
T2  - THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Existing theories of international relations have failed to interpret the hostile relations between Korea and Japan due to their Cartesian assumptions about the nature of national sovereignty and identity. Such theories view the hostilities between the two states as the result of incorrect policies or unhealthy interactions between domestic norms and foreign policies, because they believe that there are few negative structural elements between Japan and Korea. This study suggests an alternative explanation by utilising the worldview of East Asian medicine. By interpreting the formation of the Japanese and Korean national identities from the late nineteenth century and by viewing the hostility between the two states not as evidence of 'malfunctioning' inter-state relations but as a core element of their national identities, this study proposes an alternative understanding of 'problem-solving' with respect to Korea-Japan relations that is directed towards healing their relations with a long-term perspective.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study performed flood risk assessment in urbanized areas using geospatial and remotely sensed data for 1990-2005-2020 periods using the linear unmixing model (LUM), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). The urban mapping results verified with reference data indicated close agreement, with the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients higher than 88.9% and 0.78, respectively. A remarkable increase of 14.9% in urban area was observed for the period 2005-2020, compared to 7.2% during the period 1990-2005. The results of flood risk modeling revealed that RF produced slightly more accurate results than SVM. The flood risk areas aggregated with urban maps showed that the larger urban flood risk area was especially observed for the period 2005-2020. The urban areas of high/very high and medium flood risks calculated for 2020 were 19.7% and 20%, respectively. Such flood risk areas were also overlaid with the population density for urban planning and management.

TI  - A comparative case study of MTInSAR approaches for deformation monitoring of the cultural landscape of the Shanhaiguan section of the Great Wall
T2  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Wall of China is one of the largest architectural heritage sites globally, and its sustainability is a significant concern. However, its large extent and diverse characteristics are challenges for deformation monitoring. In this study, the Shanhaiguan section of the Great Wall was investigated in a case study to ascertain the damage and potential hazards of the architectural site. Two standard multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MTInSAR) technologies, including persistent scatterer SAR interferometry (PSInSAR) and small baseline subset (SBAS) SAR interferometry, were used for deformation monitoring using high-resolution TerraSAR-X data acquired in 2015-2017. The results of the two MTInSAR approaches reveal the health condition of the Great Wall. The Shanhaiguan section was stable, but local instabilities caused by rock falls were detected in some mountainous areas. In addition, the applicability of PSInSAR and SBAS was evaluated. The performance analysis of the two approaches indicated that a more reliable and adaptable MTInSAR technique needs to be developed for monitoring the Great Wall. This study demonstrates the potential of MTInSAR technology with high-resolution data for the health diagnosis of heritage sites with a linear structure, such as the Great Wall.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Full and reliable rainfall data are required for hydrological modelling, integrated water resource management, and planning. However, these data suffer from record gaps and sparse rain gage distribution, which implies that the use of an imputation method is crucial. This study aims to compare the outputs from 10 imputation methods that were used to infill missing rainfall depth data (MRD) in an arid Mediterranean region. Different statistical tests were used to assess the outputs from the imputation methods. The results showed that for MRD ranges between 5 and 20% the stepwise multiple linear regression (MLRsw) method was valid and produced the best results with a root-mean-square error (RSME) and mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 7 and 2 mm, respectively. This was followed by the Monte Carlo Markov chain expectation-maximization-based multiple imputation (MI-MCMC) method, which had an RSME and MAE of 1.01 and 0.08 mm, respectively, at 20% MRD. On the other hand, the use of satellite data for imputation (LR_GPCC estimates) was appropriate for MRD ranging between 10 and 15%, while the statistical and spatial method was suitable for MRD of less than 5%.

TI  - DNA integrity and ecophysiological responses of Spanish populations of <i>Ulmus glabra</i> to increasing ozone levels
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ulmus glabra is a deciduous tree with a wide distribution in the Eurosiberian region. The southernmost populations, in the Mediterranean area, are fragmented in mountain areas which act as a refugium. These small relict populations can act as sentinel of global change, including climate change and impacts of human activities such as air pollution. Besides, tropospheric ozone (O-3) is an additional stress factor in the Mediterranean region affecting plant physiology and health. Moreover, oxidative stress caused by O-3 could increase DNA damage in plants cells. U. glabra 4-year-old seedlings originated from a natural population growing in the Guadarrama mountain range (central Spain), were exposed in Open Top Chambers to four O-3 treatments: charcoal filtered air, non-filtered air reproducing ambient levels, non-filtered air supplemented with 15 nl l(-1) O-3 and non- filtered air supplemented with 30 nl l(-1) O-3. Ozone effects on the DNA integrity through Comet assay were evaluated and eco-physiological responses were explored as well as. Comet assay showed a significant increase of DNA damage with increasing levels of O-3 after only one-month exposure, when no eco-physiological symptoms of damage could be detected. Comet assay could thus be suggested as a predictive test to detect DNA damage induced in plants by other abiotic stresses as well as to identify tolerant and sensitive species or in preservation strategies of small relict populations. The discovery of a test for an early identification of stressed plants could be important to speed the selection of tolerant individuals for breeding programmes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern British Columbia was repeatedly covered by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) during the glacial periods. However, its mountainous terrain and remote location have thus far impeded our understanding of the central sector of the ice sheet. The improved resolution of remotely sensed data provides new opportunities to unravel the glacial history of this inaccessible location. Here, we present a comprehensive map of glacial landforms for the central sector of the CIS (55 degrees to 60 degrees N). Seven landform categories were mapped: ice flow parallel lineations, moraines (CIS outlet glacier moraines, Late Glacial moraines and moraines of unknown origin), meltwater channels (lateral and submarginal, subglacial, proglacial, and meltwater channels of unknown origin), kame terraces, eskers (single ridges and esker complexes), perched deltas and subglacial ribs. Collectively, these landforms provide a record of the extent, thickness and behaviour of the CIS, the direction of its movement and pattern of ice retreat.

TI  - Current Status of Forecasting Toxic Harmful Algae for the North-East Atlantic Shellfish Aquaculture Industry
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Across the European Atlantic Arc (Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Spain, and Portugal) the shellfish aquaculture industry is dominated by the production of mussels, followed by oysters and clams. A range of spatially and temporally variable harmful algal bloom species (HABs) impact the industry through their production of biotoxins that accumulate and concentrate in shellfish flesh, which negatively impact the health of consumers through consumption. Regulatory monitoring of harmful cells in the water column and toxin concentrations within shellfish flesh are currently the main means of warning of elevated toxin events in bivalves, with harvesting being suspended when toxicity is elevated above EU regulatory limits. However, while such an approach is generally successful in safeguarding human health, it does not provide the early warning that is needed to support business planning and harvesting by the aquaculture industry. To address this issue, a proliferation of web portals have been developed to make monitoring data widely accessible. These systems are now transitioning from "nowcasts" to operational Early Warning Systems (EWS) to better mitigate against HAB-generated harmful effects. To achieve this, EWS are incorporating a range of environmental data parameters and developing varied forecasting approaches. For example, EWS are increasingly utilizing satellite data and the results of oceanographic modeling to identify and predict the behavior of HABs. Modeling demonstrates that some HABs can be advected significant distances before impacting aquaculture sites. Traffic light indices are being developed to provide users with an easily interpreted assessment of HAB and biotoxin risk, and expert interpretation of these multiple data streams is being used to assess risk into the future. Proof-of-concept EWS are being developed to combine model information with in situ data, in some cases using machine learning-based approaches. This article: (1) reviews HAB and biotoxin issues relevant to shellfish aquaculture in the European Atlantic Arc (Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Spain, and Portugal; (2) evaluates the current status of HAB events and EWS in the region; and (3) evaluates the potential of further improving these EWS though multi-disciplinary approaches combining heterogeneous sources of information.

TI  - A new approach to monitor water quality in the Menor sea (Spain) using satellite data and machine learning methods*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Menor sea is a coastal lagoon declared by the European Union as a sensitive area to eutrophication due to human activities. To control the deterioration of its water quality, it is necessary to monitor some parameters such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a), which indicates phytoplankton biomass in the water. In the study area, current efforts focus on in-situ measurements to estimate chl-a by means of a few permanent stations and seasonal oceanographic campaigns, however they are expensive and time consuming. In this work, we proposed a machine learning approach based on Sentinel-2 data to estimate chl-a content on the upper part of the water column. Random forest (rf), support vector machine (svmRadial), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms were utilized under three feature selection scenarios, and several spectral indices were used in combination with Sentinel 2 bands. Rf, svmRadial and DNN performed better when all the available predictors were included in the models (RMSE = 0.82, 0.82 and 1.76 mg/m3 respectively), whereas ANN achieved better results under scenario c (principal components). Our results demonstrate the possibility to estimate chl-a concentration in a cost-effective manner and thereby provide near-real time information to monitor the water quality of the Menor sea, what can be of great interest for local authorities, tourism and fishing industry.

TI  - Landslide detection using visualization techniques for deep convolutional neural network models
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides occur when masses of rock, earth, and other debris move down a slope. The slope of an area is directly responsible for the magnitude of the landslide. Being able to identify regional locations more likely to be impacted by landslides is essential if interventions to prevent loss of life and liberty are to be implemented. To further this objective, studies have been carried out using deep learning methods to assess the likelihood of landslides in a localized area. This study seeks to illuminate the reliability in using the deep learning method to effectively detect landslide zones for the purpose of enacting proactive interventions. Pre-trained models of Resnet-50, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and Xception, all of which are established deep learning approaches, were used to automatically detect regional landslides and then compare results. In addition, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM + + , and Score-CAM visualization techniques were considered depending on the deep learning methods used to accurately predict the location of landslides. The present research focuses on the landslides that took place in the Gundogdu area of Rize, a city on the Black Sea cost of Turkey, from August 26 to 27, 2010, where unfortunately a significant number of individuals lost their lives. As a large number of landslide scene images are needed in order to facilitate a learning model's deep learning, images from the area were obtained by aircraft and then organized as a dataset. Non-landslide scenes were added as a separate class in the training dataset to estimate the landslide regions more accurately. In total, 80% of the data will be used for training the model, while 20% will be used for testing the model that is built out of it. The experimental results were evaluated with the receiver operating curves and f1-score applicable to landslide detection characteristics. Obtained results show that both Resnet-50 and VGG-19 had a success rate of over 90%. Results also effectively demonstrate how the best visualization techniques for localizations are Grad-CAM and Score-CAM.

TI  - Beam propagation simulation of phased laser arrays with atmospheric perturbations
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Directed energy phased array (DEPA) systems have been proposed for applications such as beaming optical power for electrical use on remote sensors, rovers, spacecraft, and future moon bases, as well as for planetary defense against asteroids and photonic propulsion up to relativistic speeds. All such scenarios involve transmission through atmosphere and beam perturbations due to turbulence that must be quantified. Numerical beam propagation and feedback control simulations were performed using an algorithm optimized for efficient calculation of real-time beam dynamics in a Kolmogorov atmosphere. Results were used to quantify the effectiveness of the system design with different degrees of atmospheric turbulence and zenith angles, and it was found that a large aperture DEPA system placed at a high altitude site can produce a stable diffraction limited spot (Strehl > 0.8) on space-based targets for Fried length r(0) >= 10 cm (at 500 nm) and zenith angles up to 60 deg, depending on atmospheric conditions. We believe these results are promising for the next generation of power beaming and deep space exploration applications. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI  - The Brazilian Cerrado is becoming hotter and drier
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is a global biodiversity hotspot with notoriously high rates of native vegetation suppression and wildfires over the past three decades. As a result, climate change can already be detected at both local and regional scales. In this study, we used three different approaches based on independent datasets to investigate possible changes in the daytime and nighttime temperature and air humidity between the peak of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season in the Brazilian Cerrado. Additionally, we evaluated the tendency of dew point depression, considering it as a proxy to assess impacts on biodiversity. Monthly increases of 2.2-4.0. in the maximum temperatures and 2.4-2.8. in the minimum temperatures between 1961 and 2019 were recorded, supported by all analyzed datasets which included direct observations, remote sensing, and modeling data. The warming raised the vapor pressure deficit, and although we recorded an upward trend in absolute humidity, relative humidity has reduced by similar to 15%. If these tendencies are maintained, gradual air warming will make nightly cooling insufficient to reach the dew point in the early hours of the night. Therefore, it will progressively reduce both the amount and duration of nocturnal dewfall, which is the main source of water for numerous plants and animal species of the Brazilian Cerrado during the dry season. Through several examples, we hypothesize that these climate changes can have a high impact on biodiversity and potentially cause ecosystems to collapse. We emphasize that the effects of temperature and humidity on Cerrado ecosystems cannot be neglected and should be further explored from a land use perspective.

TI  - Trends in land surface phenology across the conterminous United States (1982-2016) analyzed by NEON domains
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracking phenological change in a regionally explicit context is a key to understanding ecosystem status and change. The current study investigated long-term trends of satellite-observed land surface phenology (LSP) in the 17 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) domains across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Characterization of LSP trends was based on a high temporal resolution (3-d) time series of the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) derived from a long-term data record (LTDR) of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We identified significant trend patterns in LSP and their seasonal climate and land use/land cover drivers for each NEON domain. Key findings include (1) the start of season (SOS) predominantly shifted later in 13 out of 17 domains (24.3% of CONUS by area) due potentially to both a lack of spring warming in the eastern United States and changes in agronomic practices over agricultural lands; (2) the end of season (EOS) became predominantly later in nine domains dominated by natural vegetation (14.1% of CONUS by area) in response to widespread warming in autumn; (3) the EOS predominantly shifted earlier in three domains (10.6% of CONUS by area) over primarily agricultural lands as potentially affected by changes in crop growth cycles; and (4) earlier shift in the SOS was mostly found in the Northwest (3.6% of CONUS by area) and was predominant only in the moist Pacific Northwest (27.7% of the domain by area) in response to more pronounced spring warming in the region. The overall patterns of SOS and EOS trends across CONUS appeared constrained by continental-scale temperature trends as characterized by a west-east dipole and the distribution of the nation's agricultural lands. In addition, seasonal trend analysis revealed that most NEON domains (15/17) became predominantly greener in part of or throughout the growing season, potentially contributed by both climate change-induced growth increase and improved agricultural productivity. The domain-wide LSP trends with their underlying drivers identified here provide important contextual information for NEON science as well as for investigations within CONUS using other distributed observatories (e.g., LTER, LTAR, FLUXNET, USA-NPN, etc.).

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Mapping Techniques for Earthquake-Triggered Landslide Inventories in an Urban Subarctic Environment: A Case Study of the 2018 Anchorage, Alaska Earthquake
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake-induced landslide inventories can be generated using field observations but doing so can be challenging if the affected landscape is large or inaccessible after an earthquake. Remote sensing data can be used to help overcome these limitations. The effectiveness of remotely sensed data to produce landslide inventories, however, is dependent on a variety of factors, such as the extent of coverage, timing, and data quality, as well as environmental factors such as atmospheric interference (e.g., clouds, water vapor) or snow and vegetation cover. With these challenges in mind, we use a combination of field observations and remote sensing data from multispectral, light detection and ranging (lidar), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to produce a ground failure inventory for the urban areas affected by the 2018 magnitude (M-w) 7.1 Anchorage, Alaska earthquake. The earthquake occurred during late November at high latitude (similar to 61 degrees N), and the lack of sunlight, persistent cloud cover, and snow cover that occurred after the earthquake made remote mapping challenging for this event. Despite these challenges, 43 landslides were manually mapped and classified using a combination of the datasets mentioned previously. Using this manually compiled inventory, we investigate the individual performance and reliability of three remote sensing techniques in this environment not typically hospitable to remotely sensed mapping. We found that differencing pre- and post-event normalized difference vegetation index maps and lidar worked best for identifying soil slumps and rapid soil flows, but not as well for small soil slides, soil block slides and rock falls. The SAR-based methods did not work well for identifying any landslide types because of high noise levels likely related to snow. Some landslides, especially those that resulted in minor surface displacement, were identifiable only from the field observations. This work highlights the importance of the rapid collection of field observations and provides guidance for future mappers on which techniques, or combination of techniques, will be most effective at remotely mapping landslides in a subarctic and urban environment.

TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis: an autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease?
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with hallmarks of both autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathology. In this Review, the authors examine the evidence for both disease processes and aim to reconcile the two.Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology. Unlike other systemic autoimmune diseases, in AS, the innate immune system has a dominant role characterized by aberrant activity of innate and innate-like immune cells, including gamma delta T cells, group 3 innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, mucosal-associated invariant T cells and mast cells, at sites predisposed to the disease. The intestine is involved in disease manifestations, as it is at the forefront of the interaction between the mucosal-associated immune cells and the intestinal microbiota. Similarly, biomechanical factors, such as entheseal micro-trauma, might also be involved in the pathogenesis of the articular manifestation of AS, and sentinel immune cells located in the entheses could provide links between local damage, genetic predisposition and the development of chronic inflammation. Although these elements might support the autoinflammatory nature of AS, studies demonstrating the presence of autoantibodies (such as anti-CD74, anti-sclerostin and anti-noggin antibodies) and evidence of activation and clonal expansion of T cell populations support an autoimmune component to the disease. This Review presents the evidence for autoinflammation and the evidence for autoimmunity in AS and, by discussing the pathophysiological factors associated with each, aims to reconcile the two hypotheses.

TI  - Ecological corridors in Costa Rica: An evaluation applying landscape structure, fragmentation-connectivity process, and climate adaptation
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, ecological corridors have been proposed on a global scale as a response to the accelerated process of natural ecosystem fragmentation, mainly as a result of human impact. In accordance with this trend, Costa Rica has undergone a process of implementing ecological corridors as to promote ecological connectivity since the 1990s, with the establishment of 44 ecological corridors covering 38% of Costa Rica's territory. Nevertheless, there is no research evaluating these corridors on a national scale that takes into account their functions as conduits, barriers, and habitats. Thus, the objective of this research was to describe the process of biological corridor formation in Costa Rica, and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of corridors by considering aspects of landscape structure and ecological processes related to connectivity and fragmentation. We used the National Program of Ecological Corridors database along with coverage analysis from Landsat images from 2000 and 2015.The composition of the biological corridors was determined at the landscape scale and related to potential to maintain a specific population of wild mammals weighing more than 10 kg. The composition of the ecological corridors was highly variable in terms of total area, proportion of natural habitat, and fragmentation process. Most biological corridors are capable of maintaining viable populations of Pecari tajacu and Tapir bairdii, while none could maintain populations of Panthera onca and Tayassu pecari. Only 50% of the biological corridors had improved in their connectivity. Therefore, public policies, such as master plans focusing on ecosystem restoration must be established. In addition, only two biological corridors incorporate the majority of elevation ranges (Life Zones) present in the country, which reduces the potential of the corridor system as a tool for climate change adaptation.

TI  - Mapping and estimating harvest potential of seaweed culture using Worldview-2 Satellite images: a case study in Nusa Lembongan, Bali - Indonesia
T2  - AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Unreliable information on harvest potential is a persistent challenge for the Indonesian government and industry alike to manage an efficient supply chain of seaweed raw material. The use of remote sensing technology to assess seaweed harvest potential has been scarcely available in the literature. This current research aimed at estimating the harvest potential of seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii through remote sensing using supervised classification with maximum likelihood (MLC) and contextual editing (CE) methods. This research evaluated the capabilities of different band combinations along with depth invariant index (DII) to enhance the remote sensing accuracy in estimating seaweed harvest potential. The seaweed classification using Worldview-2 imagery was compared with the in-situ references (ground-truthing). The potential data bias resulted from different imagery acquisition timestamps with the in-situ measurement was kept minimal as both data time stamps were ten days apart and within the same seaweed culture cycle. The average dry weight of all seaweed samples collected during the research was 924 +/- 278.91 g/m(2) with culture ages between 1 and 40 days. The classification results based on MLC+CE with a 5-band combination method without DII showed a better correlation and closer fit with the in-situ references compared to the other methods, with an overall accuracy of 79.05% and Tau coefficient value of 0.75. The estimated total harvest potential based on the combined seaweed classes was 531.26 +/- 250.29 tons dry weight.

TI  - Cetaceans as sentinels for informing climate change policy in UK waters
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is predicted to have profound consequences for marine ecosystems. Due to the growing political and social drive to address its impacts, monitoring and mitigating climate change is a priority in marine policy in the UK. Cetaceans have been proposed as informative sentinel species for monitoring ocean health. Here, strandings data from four UK cetacean species were assessed for their use as a tool to aid policy makers monitoring climate change in marine environments. Data on stranded cetaceans were collected from 1990 to 2018 and differences in the proportions of stranded cold water adapted and warm water adapted species assessed using Generalised Linear Models (GLM), with 6-year periods and four regions of the UK included as explanatory variables. This modelling approach showed an increase in the proportion of stranded warm water adapted species over time across the UK and that differences in proportion of strandings between cold water and warm water adapted species can be detected between regions and 6-year periods, chosen as metrics to coordinate with reporting cycles for policy assessment needs. As such, these results show the potential for utilising strandings data to identify changing oceanic trends at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales for policy reporting in the UK. However, development of these analyses with a more detailed examination of these data at a finer resolution, incorporating other data sources, such as distribution trends and dietary stable isotope data, may be required before it is applicable as an indicator for trends in changes in climate.

TI  - Estimation of daily mean land surface temperature at global scale using pairs of daytime and nighttime MODIS instantaneous observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimations of daily mean land surface temperature (LST) are important for investigating the urban heat island effect, land-atmosphere energy exchanges, and global climate change. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors can provide up to four instantaneous LSTs of a single day across the world. However, numerous studies, such as those on climate change and hydrology, require the input of daily mean LSTs rather than instantaneous value. In this paper, we propose a practical method to estimate the daily mean LST using instantaneous LST products derived from MODIS. Based on the in situ LST measurements collected from 235 sites distributed globally, multiple linear regressions of two to four valid instantaneous LSTs at different MODIS observations moments (at least one daytime and one nighttime observations) can provide reliable estimates of daily mean LSTs under all-weather conditions with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 1.60 K. In addition, the conditions of clouds would affect the estimation accuracy of daily mean LST to a certain extent. Subsequently, an algorithm is proposed to produce the most complete coverage of daily mean LSTs from instantaneous LST products derived from MODIS. Validation results with in situ measurements show that the daily mean LSTs estimated from the MOD11A1 and MYD11A1 products are similar to the daily mean of the in situ LST, with an RMSE of 2.17 K. Furthermore, the daily mean LST derived from MODIS data is successfully applied to calculate the global annual cycle parameters (ACPs) in the annual temperature cycle (ATC) model. The results of this study show that the daily mean LST can be retrieved accurately from combinations of daytime and nighttime LSTs derived from MODIS. We expect that our findings will be useful for various applications involving global LST trend analysis and climate change.

TI  - Comparison of two different surgical strategies for breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two separated incisions are generally adopted in breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, one-incision procedure is also applied in clinical practice. The outcomes of the two different surgical strategies remain unknown. This issue needs to be investigated. The medical records of breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy combined with an SLNB were reviewed retrospectively. Group A comprised patients who received a single incision for both the mastectomy and SLNB. Group B comprised patients who received a second incision for the SLNB. Demographics and outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were 280 female patients divided into Groups A (n = 130) and B (n = 150) included in this study. Preoperatively, the two groups were similar in demographics for age, tumor size, tumor location, body mass index, pathologic type, and cancer stage (P > 0.05). Group A showed shorter surgical times (129.5 +/- 29.0 vs. 136.7 +/- 21.9 min), less postoperative upper limb numbness (12.3% vs. 25.3%), and more harvested sentinel lymph nodes (3.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.0) than Group B (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences for intraoperative blood loss, total postoperative drainage amount, hospital stay, upper limb motility, upper limb pain, upper limb edema, number of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes, follow-up time, or recurrent cases (P > 0.05). The one-incision approach for a breast cancer mastectomy plus SLNB has several advantages over the two-incision approach, including a shorter surgical time, decreased upper limb numbness, and the harvesting of more sentinel lymph nodes. Further prospective randomized controlled clinical trials should be designed to verify the current findings.

TI  - Preparation of a bacterial flocculant by using caprolactam as a sole substrate and its application in amoxicillin removal
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High cost is one of the limiting factors in the industrial production of bioflocculant. Simultaneous preparation of bioflocculant from the contaminants in wastewater was considered as a potential approach to reduce the production cost. In this study, caprolactam was verified as sole feedstock for the growth of strain Alcaligenes faecalis subsp. phenolicus ZY-16 in batch experiments. Chemical analysis showed that the as-prepared MBF-16 consisted of heteropolysaccharides (88.3%) and peptides (9.4%). XPS result indicated the plentiful acylamino, hydroxyl and amino groups in MBF-16, which have an indispensable role in amoxicillin flocculation. The flocculation of amoxicillin can be well stimulated by Freundlich isotherm equation, and the Kf was up to 178.6524 for amoxicillin. The kinetic fitting results proved that the flocculation of amoxicillin by MBF-16 was chemisorbed. This contribution may develop a novel technology for the preparation of bacterial flocculants that can consume toxic substrates (caprolactam) and have potential applications in amoxicillin removal.

TI  - Estimating air pollutant emissions from crop residue open burning through a calculation of open burning proportion based on satellite-derived fire radiative energy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue open burning has substantial negative effects on air quality, human health, and climate change, and accurate and timely estimates of its air pollutant emissions are essential. Open burning proportion (OBP) is the key parameter in estimating the emission from the crop residue open burning by bottom-up method. However, the OBP is mainly obtained by field investigation, which consumes much time, manpower and financial resources, leading to the OBP data deficient seriously. In this study, the significant logarithmic relations were found between OBP and fire radiative energy (FRE), and then the FRE-based OBP estimation models were developed for different regions of China. The comparison between the FRE-based OBP and the field-investigated OBP illustrated the reliability of the developed models (r = 0.71, NMB = -8% and NME = 25%). The OBPs of different municipalities/provinces in mainland China from 2003 to 2018 were further calculated. The results showed that the estimated OBP variation exhibited fluctuating upward trend with annual mean growth rate of 3.7% from 2003 to 2014, while dramatically decreased with annual mean reduction rate of 5.9% from 2014 to 2018. The estimation accuracy of emission from open biomass burning can also be can be significantly improved by basing on the yearspecific OBP, compared with the calculation based on fixed OBP. The annual PM2.5 emissions would decrease 4.5%-25.9% and increase 6.6%-30.7% in the scenarios of a fixed OBP during 2003-2014 and 2014-2018, respectively. The developed models complemented the severely missing OBP data of mainland China for the first time. By combining the advantages of bottom-up approach and FRE method, the proposed FRE-based models can avoid their disadvantages, and can help to get more accurately and timely emissions from crop residue open burning.

TI  - A tropical Atlantic dynamics analysis by combining machine learning and satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The western tropical Atlantic Ocean is a very energetic and highly variable region. It is one of the main contributors to the interhemispheric mass and heat transports. This study aim is to give a new picture of the space and time variability of this region using statistical tools applied to five different satellite measurements (Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Surface Salinity, ocean topography, wind stress vectors). We first processed each data set by using a Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), which is an efficient clustering methodology based on non-linear artificial neural networks to compress the information embedded in the data. The SOM was then combined with a Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC) to cluster the different phenomena in a small number of classes whose physical characteristics are easy to identify. Three classes were identified which allowed us to analyse the dynamics of the North Brazil Current, and the North Equatorial Countercurrent, respectively, and their links with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and the Amazon and Orinoco river runoffs. The SOM + HAC analysis gave a coherent picture of the concomitant seasonal variability of the variables. Furthermore, we were able to point out the correlations existing between salinity features recently discovered and wind, temperature, and dynamic topography structures. Applying our method to the interannual signals, we showed a year to year variability which deserves further analysis. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigating the effects of land use change on flood hydrograph using HEC-HMS hydrologic model (case study: Ekbatan Dam)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modeling academic studies have focused on the response to human-caused land use changes. The effects of land use change on flood degree in the catchment basin of Ekbatan Dam were investigated in this study, which looked at changes that occurred in 1985, 2000, and 2015. A combination of remote sensing and the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) was used to achieve this goal. First, Landsat satellite images and sensors from Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), and Operational Land Imager were used to create land use maps for the target years. The weighted curve numbers (CN), a parameter related to infiltration, were then calculated for land uses. The extracted CN value, along with physiographic parameters and rainfall-runoff data, was then imported into the HEC-HMS model to simulate the effect of land use changes on runoff volume. After calibration and validation of the model using five (5) flood events, the simulation results showed an increase in the discharge peak volume of 64.3, 67.3, and 70.5 (m(3)/s) during the years 1985, 2000, and 2015, respectively, which resulted in an increase in the runoff height in these years as well.

TI  - Copernicus Sentinel-3B-GPS L2C tracking tests during commissioning phase
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-3B, the twin satellite of Copernicus Sentinel-3A, was launched on 25 April 2018. During its commissioning phase, the radar altimeter satellite has been flying in tandem with Sentinel-3A, only 30 s apart. This was mainly done for calibration and validation of the instruments on-board Sentinel-3B, maximizing the correlation of measurements taken by both Sentinel-3 satellites.The commissioning phase of Sentinel-3B and thus the tandem flight with Sentinel-3A has also been used to do several tests with the RUAG GPS receivers on-board Sentinel-3B. Future missions like the Copernicus Sentinel-C and -D satellites and the Copernicus Sentinel-6 (Jason-CS) satellite will carry an enhanced RUAG GNSS receiver (PODRIX). The GPS receivers on Sentinel-3B already have the capability to track the GPS L2C signal, which will become important for the future when the number of GPS satellites transmitting the L2C signal increase from currently 19 satellites up to the full GPS constellation. To test the receiver's L2C tracking performance, the redundant receiver on Sentinel-3B has been running in parallel to the main receiver with L2C tracking enabled, either exclusively or in a mixed P(Y)&L2C configuration.The performance of this new signal is analysed in detail. The Sentinel-3B POD processing chain running at the Copernicus POD Service is used to determine orbits based on the P(Y) signals from the main receiver and based on C/A plus the new L2C signal from the redundant receiver, all of them publicly available via the Copernicus Open Access Hub. The Sentinel-3B POD performance is compared to that of Sentinel-3A and the results of the Sentinel-3B redundant receiver are directly compared to the results of the main receiver. Results are compared in terms of observation metrics, estimated orbit parameters and differences to internal and external orbit products. External orbit validation is done with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements to the satellites. Although only 19GPS satellites are currently broadcasting the L2C signal, the resulting orbits are of equivalent quality as the operational orbit products based on P(Y) data from the full GPS constellation. SLR mean and standard deviation of 0.37 +/- 1.32 cm and 0.39 +/- 1.43 cm for the main and redundant receiver solutions, respectively, confirm the orbit accuracy independent of the signals used for POD.The percentage of more than five observations per epoch is still very low with approx. 15% considering the current L2C capable GPS constellation. Increase of this percentage is analysed based on a step-wise increase of the L2C capable GPS satellites up to a GPS constellation of 31 satellites. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Dual-polarimetric descriptors from Sentinel-1 GRD SAR data for crop growth assessment
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and high-resolution spatio-temporal information about crop phenology obtained from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is an essential component for crop management and yield estimation at a local scale. Crop growth monitoring studies seldom exploit complete polarimetric information contained in dual-pol GRD SAR data. In this study, we propose three polarimetric descriptors: the pseudo scattering-type parameter (theta(c)), the pseudo scattering entropy parameter (H-c), and the co-pol purity parameter (m(c)) from dual-pol S1 GRD SAR data. We also introduce a novel unsupervised clustering framework using H-c and theta(c) with six clustering zones to represent various scattering mechanisms. We implemented the proposed algorithm on the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for Sentinel-1 SAR data. We have shown the sensitivity of these descriptors over a time series of data for wheat and canola crops at a test site in Canada. From the leaf development stage to the flowering stage for both crops, the pseudo scattering-type parameter theta(c) changes by approximately 17 degrees. Moreover, within the entire phenology window, both m(c) and H-c varies by about 0.6. The effectiveness of theta(c) and H-c to cluster the phenological stages for the two crops is also evident from the clustering plot. During the leaf development stage, about 90% of the sampling points were clustered into the low to medium entropy scattering zone for both the crops. Throughout the flowering stage, the entire cluster shifted into the high entropy vegetation scattering zone. Finally, during the ripening stage, the clusters of sample points were split between the high entropy vegetation scattering zone and the high entropy distributed scattering zone, with > 55% of the sampling points in the high entropy distributed scattering zone. This innovative clustering framework will facilitate the operational use of S1 GRD SAR data for agricultural applications.

TI  - Corsica: A 20-Yr multi-mission absolute altimeter calibration site
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Initially developed for monitoring the performance of TOPEX/Poseidon and follow-on Jason legacy satellite altimeters, the Corsica geodetic facilities that are located both at Senetosa Cape and near Ajaccio have been developed to calibrate successive satellite altimeters in an absolute sense. Since 1998, the successful calibration process used to calibrate most of the oceanographic satellite altimeter missions has been regularly updated in terms of in situ instruments, geodetic measurements and methodologies. In this study, we present an assessment of the long-term stability of the in situ instruments in terms of sea level monitoring that include a careful monitoring of the geodetic datum. Based on this 20-yr series of sea level measurements, we present a review of the derived absolute Sea Surface Height (SSH) biases for the following altimetric missions based on the most recent reprocessing of their data set: TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1/2/3, Envisat and ERS-2, CryoSat-2, SARAL/AltiKa and Sentinel-3A&B. For the longest time series the standard error of the absolute SSH biases is now at a few millimeters level which is fundamental to maintain the high level of confidence that scientists have in the global mean sea level rise.

TI  - Lake and reservoir volume variations in South America from radar altimetry, ICESat laser altimetry, and GRACE time-variable gravity
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to 25-years of radar altimetry measurements from TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason 1, 2 and 3, ENVISAT and others, water level changes of major lakes and rivers can be measured regularly, remotely, with unprecedented precision, facilitating monitoring of continental water storage variations. In addition, the 18 laser altimeter measurement campaigns over 6 years by the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) satellite complement these radar altimetry measurements and also validate them, expanding our monitoring capabilities. We extract derived water height estimates for various lakes in South America from radar and laser altimetry measurements. Using available imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we estimate time-variable surface extent of these water bodies, and together with the altimetry, we derive corresponding estimates of relative volume variations for a number of lakes and reservoirs in South America. We see good agreement between our water extent and available products, with some differences when snow covered area are present. We find good agreement between the temporal variations of lake water heights obtained from ICE Sat, radar altimetry, and in situ measurements, when available. Lake-dependent biases still exist, likely due to differences in reference datum, choice of geoid model, and differences in data processing schemes. The is a good agreement in volume changes obtained from imagery and the various altimetry techniques. Furthermore, using the latest one-degree global iterated mascon solutions from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, we successfully compare them to independent volume changes assessments for these water bodies, derived from mass variations from time-variable gravity measurements from 15 years of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations. The agreement in water volume changes from GRACE with those from altimetry and imagery is higher for lakes in arid and semi-arid regions than on mountainous areas. GRACE volume estimates remain limited to the spatial resolution and the quality of the hydrology models used to correct for soil-moisture and snow contributions. Overall, studies like the one presented here further validate the power of leveraging these data synergies to monitor continental water storage changes from space, taking advantage of what each of the techniques has to offer. We show that water level measurements from laser and radar altimeters have similar precision, of a few centimeters over inland water bodies, and prove that GRACE global mascons allow to retrieve small lake relative volume changes, even for small bodies, thanks to their higher sensitivity to small wavelength mass variations.

TI  - Risk factors for nonvisualization of the sentinel lymph node on lymphoscintigraphy in breast cancer patients
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Accurate sentinel lymph node (SLN) staging is essential for both prognosis and treatment in patients with breast cancer. However, the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may fail to visualize the SLN in some patients. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors associated with SLN nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy. For this single-center retrospective study, all data of lymphoscintigraphy of SLN procedures from March 2011 to April 2021 were collected and reviewed from the Amsterdam UMC database. Results A total of 1886 SLN procedures were included in this study. The SLN nonvisualization rate was 25.1% on lymphoscintigraphy at 4 h post-injection. The SLN nonvisualization rate decreased to 9.4% after reinjection. Multivariable analysis showed that age >= 70 years (P < 0.001; OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.46-3.53), BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) (P = 0.031; OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.04-2.12) and nonpalpable tumors (P = 0.004; OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.15-2.07) were independent predictors of SLN nonvisualization. Tumor location, brand of radiopharmaceutical, injected dose and volume, experience of preparer and administrator were not associated with SLN nonvisualization. None of the patient, tumor or tracer characteristics were associated with SLN nonvisualization after radiotracer reinjection. Conclusions This study shows that risk factors for SLN nonvisualization in breast cancer patients during preoperative lymphoscintigraphy are age >= 70 years, BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) and nonpalpable tumors. Our results support the notion that SLN lymphoscintigraphy is a very robust technique that does not depend on the experience of the preparer or administrator of the radiotracer.

TI  - Improving the quality of Sentinel-3A data with a hybrid mean sea surface model, and implications for Sentinel-3B and SWOT
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we compute a new local mean sea surface (MSS) model along the Sentinel-3A ground track. This so-called hybrid mean profile (HMP) blends the content of an average of 18 months of Sentinel-3A data for wavelengths ranging from 15 to 100 km, and the CNES/CLS 2015 gridded MSS model for larger and shorter scales.The improvement observed on Sentinel-3A sea level anomalies (SLA) is significant: the residual error is 0.2 cm(2), i.e. 17% of the SLA variance between 15 and 100 km, or 57% less than the gridded MSS model error. The highest error reduction is observed for wavelengths ranging from 20 to 80 km. From a geographical point of view, the improvement is mainly located along geodetic features that are not completely resolved in the gridded MSS models. It can locally be as high as 1 cm(2), i.e. very large when compared to the variance of the small scale SLA. Similarly, in coastal regions where the gridded model is known to exhibit higher errors, the HMP exhibits a very stable behavior that is on average 4 times more accurate.To understand the implications for future datasets and mission, we also develop a simple prediction model for the leakage of noise and small scale SLA into the MSS model. The model was validated with Sentinel-3A and ENVISAT data. Using the HMP strategy on the 21-day phase of the SWOT mission would be attractive for two reasons: 1/this methodology would reduce the small scale error of gridded MSS models thanks to SWOT's unprecedented 2D topography coverage and noise level, and 2/the gridded MSS models provides a more trustworthy reference for the larger temporal scales that cannot be not averaged out by SWOT alone. After 3 years of nominal mission, the residual SWOT HMP error should be less than 2% of the sea level anomaly variance. In contrast, the so-called fast-sampling (or 1-day repeat) phase of SWOT is slightly more challenging because of the temporal correlation of the SLA (1-day samples are not independent). Depending on the accuracy of the pre-launch gridded MSS (i.e. upper wavelength limit where SWOT data must be used), the decorrelation scales could range from 1 to 5 days. The resulting HMP error would ranges from 5 to 12% of the SLA variance at the end of the fast-sampling phase.These results emphasize the need to keep improving the smaller scales of gridded MSS models as they will remain a major altimetry asset, at least until 2023, when SWOT has collected enough 21-day samples to provide a very robust HMP model.

TI  - A RIP-based SAR retracker and its application in North East Atlantic with Sentinel-3
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Just as CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3 embarks on board a radar altimeter (SRAL) with the novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode that enables higher resolution and more accurate altimeter-derived parameters in the coastal zone, thanks to the reduced along-track footprint. Exploiting the SAR data in the recent years, many researchers have already proven that the performance of SAR altimetry with specific coastal retrackers is superior to collocated Pseudo-Low Resolution Mode (PLRM) coastal altimetry algorithms but they also pointed out that residual errors due to land contamination are still present in the very proximity of the land (0-3 km).The objective of this work is to further improve these results by exploiting extra information provided by SAR altimeters, namely the so-called Range Integrated Power (RIP), the new waveform built by a simple integration of the Doppler beams in the range direction. The RIP characterizes the backscattering state of the ground cell, towards which all the Doppler beams have been steered. These developments lead to a new retracker, here coined SAMOSA++, in which the RIP, as computed from the L1B-S data, is converted into a surface backscattering profile and directly integrated in the SAMOSA retracker as part of the model formulation itself. In this way, the modified SAMOSA model is automatically and autonomously able to cope with the different return waveform shapes from different surface types: either diffusive or specular. The mean square slope computed from the RIP is also estimated, representing a new output of the retracker.The performance of this new retracker is here cross-compared against its previous version, SAMOSA+, and against the standard Sentinel-3 marine PDGS (Payload Data Ground Segment) SAR retracker (SAMOSA2) in both coastal zone and open ocean in order to ensure a seamless transition between these zones.The new retracker SAMOSA++ is validated in the North East Atlantic region, where appropriate in situ validation data are available. The retrievals from the new retracker are cross-compared against the network of tide gauges and buoys in the German Bight and versus the output of the GCOAST Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) regional circulation and wave model. In addition, sea level estimates derived with different ocean tide and wet path delay geophysical correction models are compared. Results indicate that in this region the best geophysical correction models are the FES2014b tide model and the GPD+ wet tropospheric correction that incorporates data from the Sentinel-3 on-board radiometer.Analyses show that both SAMOSA+ and SAMOSA++ ensure the continuity of the PDGS SAR Marine retracker in the open ocean, leading to clear improvements in the coastal zone, larger for SAMOSA++ than for SAMOSA+. In summary, the new SAMOSA++ retracker retrieves more accurate altimetric parameters in the coastal zone, with a better consistency with respect to regional ocean models and in situ data.

TI  - The impacts of New Zealand's COVID-19 epidemic response on community antibiotic use and hospitalisation for pneumonia, peritonsillar abscess and rheumatic fever
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The rate of community antibiotic use in New Zealand (NZ) is high and some may be un-necessary. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (Alert Levels) were implemented in 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in NZ and were likely to have affected antibiotic prescribing.Methods: We aimed to identify the impact of these public health interventions on community antibiotic dispensing. We also examined rates of hospitalisation with infectious diseases that could be influenced by changing community antibiotic use. A retrospective review of two national databases was undertaken.Findings: 1.17 million people received 1.19 million prescriptions for antibiotics between 23/02/2020 and 18/07/2020. Antibiotic dispensing rates fell from 14 prescriptions per 10 0 0 population per week during pre-Alert Level weeks to 9 prescriptions per 10 0 0 population per week (a reduction of 36%) during the weeks of COVID Alert Level 3-4. Large reductions were seen with antibiotics predominantly used for respiratory-or urinary-tract infections. Hospital discharges with sentinel infections did not increase over this period; pneumonia discharges during Alert Level weeks were lower than in 2017-2019 (3 vs 6 dis-charges per 10 0,0 0 0 population).Interpretation: A large reduction in community antibiotic dispensing was observed in NZ during the implementation of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to eliminate COVID-19. Despite this marked reduction in antibiotic use, there was no increase in rates of hospitalisation for sentinel infections that community antibiotic use could prevent. These findings suggest that countries with high rates of antibiotic use could significantly reduce their use without an increase in morbidity. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The case for increasing the posting rate in delay/Doppler altimeters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we analyze the effect of increasing the posting rate of delay/Doppler altimeters on the retrieval of open ocean geophysical parameters. The conventional posting rate for synthetic aperture radar altimeters data is 20 Hz, which on-ground corresponds to the typical delay/Doppler along-track resolution of about 320 m. However, the speckle autocorrelation properties of delay/Doppler waveforms over the open ocean show a decorrelation distance much shorter than the typical along-track resolution, suggesting that further information can be extracted if more frequent observations of the surface were obtained. By processing one cycle of Sentinel-3A data at different posting rates we have verified that a relative improvement of more than 20% in the measurement noise of both sea surface height and significant wave height can be achieved, just by increasing the posting rate from 20 to 40 Hz, and an even further improvement is obtained at 80 Hz. We believe this result has significant implications for the current CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 missions and the upcoming Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission.

TI  - Impervious surface extraction based on different methods from multiple spatial resolution images: a comprehensive comparison
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many efforts have been devoted to extracting impervious surfaces based on different methods from multiple spatial resolution images. Differences in extraction methods and spatial resolutions are significant and have led to discrepant performances in terms of the impervious surface extraction accuracy. However, which extraction method is more suitable for which kind of spatial resolution image in practice is poorly understood. This study systematically compared the performances of 12 methods of impervious surface extraction for four spatial resolution images (i.e. Landsat 8 [30 m], Sentinel-2A [20 m], Sentinel-2A [10 m], and Gaofen-2 [4 m]) in three testing areas. The results indicated that for the medium-spatial resolutions of 30 and 20 m, the support vector machine (SVM) method was considered as the optimal classification method with the highest accuracy of impervious surface extraction. For the high-spatial resolutions of 10 and 4 m, the object based image analysis (OBIA) method obtained the highest accuracy of the impervious surface distribution. Furthermore, the perpendicular impervious surface index (PISI) outperformed the other indices in obtaining the impervious surface distribution, with the highest accuracy for four spatial resolution images. These comprehensive assessments can provide a valuable guidance for future impervious surface extraction from different spatial resolutions.

TI  - Advances in NE-Atlantic coastal sea level change monitoring by Delay Doppler altimetry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant part of the World population lives in the coastal zone, which is affected by sea level rise and extreme events. Consistent and precise new measurements are needed to assess and predict these changes. New altimeter missions equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode provide more accurate sea level heights. In this work we analyse their impacts on the estimation of the coastal sea level variability in the last 10 km. First, by analysing various standard and improved SAR altimetric products it is found that SAR altimetry will reduce the minimum usable distance from five to three kilometres. The best performance is achieved with the SAR coastal retrackers SAMOSA+ and SAMOSA++. A comparable performance is obtained in low resolution Reduced SAR (RDSAR) mode with the Spatio-Temporal Altimeter sub-waveform Retracker (STAR). In both cases, sea level heights are recovered with 4 cm accuracy up to 3 km from the coast at the Helgoland station, and the accuracy does not decrease with the distance to coast. In estuaries and coastal zones with hight tidal regimes, the discrepancy between altimetry and in-situ observations remains large (40 cm standard deviation difference (stdd) with SAR-SAM+). CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A have similar accuracy, despite their different repeat cycle and sampling, which require a different post-processing. The monthly coastal variability from the SAR-SAM+ product agrees most favourably with the NEMO-WAM model, with stdd 3.9 and correlation 0.90 for Sentinel-3A. Instead, the maximum departure between altimeter data products is between SAR-SAM+ and RDSAR-TALES CryoSat-2 data (stdd 2.3 and correlation 0.96).An average trend of about 3 +/- 1.3 mm/yr has been detected using low resolution altimetry at ninetheen in-situ stations along the German coast over time intervals longer than 15 years. The difference of the trends of altimetry and tide gauge co-located time-series (al-tg) agrees with the GNSS rates within 1.5 mm/yr at half of the co-located locations, with error of al-tg larger than the error of the GPS rate by a factor bigger than two.The larger departure between monthly tide gauge and LRM altimetric time-series as between tide gauge and SAR altimetric time series confirms the higher accuracy of SAR data compared to LRM. Finally, the sea level trends of the merged LRM and SAR altimetry time-series are consistent with the LRM trends. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - Investigating the potential of Sentinel-2 configuration to predict the quality of Mediterranean permanent grasslands in open woodlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of pasture quality in permanent grasslands is essential for their conservation and management, as it can contribute to making real-time decisions for livestock management. In this study, we assessed the potential of Sentinel-2 configuration to predict forage quality in high diverse Mediterranean permanent grasslands of open woodlands. We evaluated the performance of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) models to predict crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and enzyme digestibility of organic matter (EDOM) by using three different reflectance datasets: (i) laboratory measurements of reflectance of dry and ground pasture samples re-sampled to Sentinel-2 configuration (Spec-lab) (ii) field in-situ measurements of grasslands canopy reflectance resampled to Sentinel-2 configuration (Spec-field); (iii) and Bottom Of Atmosphere Sentinel-2 imagery. For the three reflectance datasets, the models to predict CP content showed moderate performance and predictive ability. Mean R-test(2) = 0.68 were obtained using Speclab data, mean R-test(2) decreased by 0.11 with Spec-field and by 0.18 when Sentinel-2 reflectance was used. Statistics for NDF showed worse predictions than those obtained for CP: predictions produced with Spec-lab showed mean R(test)2 = 0.64 and mean RPDtest = 1.73. The mean values of R-test(2) = 0.50 and RPDtest = 1.54 using Sentinel-2 BOA reflectance were marginally better than the values obtained with Spec-field (mean R-test(2) = 0.48, mean RPDtest = 1.43). For ADF and EDOM, only predictions made with Spec-lab produced acceptable results. Bands from the rededge region, especially band 5, and the SWIR regions showed the highest contribution to estimating CP and NDF. Bands 2, blue and 4, red also seem to be important. The imple-mentation of field spectroscopy in combination with Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be feasible to produce forage quality maps and to develop larger datasets. This study contributes to increasing knowledge of the potential and applicability of Sentinel-2 to predict the quality of Mediterranean permanent grasslands in open woodlands. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Stroke Risk Among Non-Elderly Users of Haloperidol or First-Generation Antipsychotics vs Second-Generation Antipsychotics: A Cohort Study from a US Health Insurance Claims Database
T2  - DRUGS-REAL WORLD OUTCOMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Previous studies have reported an increased risk of stroke in patients taking antipsychotics. However, most of these studies have been conducted in the elderly population. Objective We estimated stroke risk in new users of any first-generation antipsychotic or haloperidol, vs second-generation antipsychotics among patients aged 18-64 years without a recent dementia diagnosis and, separately, regardless of a recent dementia diagnosis. Methods Data were obtained from IBM MarketScan(R) Commercial Database (1 January, 2001-31 December, 2017). Among new users without a recent dementia diagnosis, stroke risk for first-generation antipsychotics (FGAw/oD cohort) or haloperidol (HALw/oD cohort) was compared with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAw/oD cohort). A similar comparison was conducted among new users regardless of dementia diagnosis: first-generation antipsychotics (FGA cohort) or haloperidol (HAL cohort) vs second-generation antipsychotics (SGA cohort). Crude incident stroke rates within each cohort were determined. For hazard ratios, three propensity score matching strategies were used: unadjusted (crude), Sentinel propensity score strategy, and large-scale regularized regression model (adapted propensity score strategy). Results Each cohort included >= 12,000 patients. The incident rates for stroke per 1000 person-years were 3.10 (FGAw/oD), 5.99 (HALw/oD), 0.85 (SGAw/oD), 3.14 (FGA), 6.12 (HAL), and 0.90 (SGA). Pre-planned analysis with adapted propensity score strategy matching yielded calibrated hazard ratios for stroke: FGAw/oD vs SGAw/oD: 2.05 (calibrated confidence interval 1.13-3.89); HALw/oD vs SGAw/oD: 2.47 (1.14-5.48), FGA vs SGA: 1.64 (0.94-2.97), and HAL vs SGA: 1.98 (0.99-4.00). A post-hoc sensitivity analysis to address potential bias introduced by the 2015 change from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision yielded calibrated hazard ratios for FGAw/oD vs SGAw/oD: 1.59 (0.87-3.01), HALw/oD vs SGAw/oD: 2.79 (1.24-6.42), FGA vs SGA: 1.41 (0.79-2.62), and HAL vs SGA: 3.47 (1.63-7.92). Conclusions Among adults aged <= 64 years, without a recent dementia diagnosis, stroke risk is higher among those exposed to haloperidol compared with those exposed to second-generation antipsychotics.

TI  - Spatial Dynamic Selection Network for Remote-Sensing Image Fusion
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, high-resolution images with rich spectral information are necessary for earth observation. Remote-sensing image fusion is an effective method to provide high-resolution multispectral images, which are obtained by fusing high-resolution panchromatic images and low-resolution multispectral images. However, existing methods mostly use the same network for image feature extraction, without considering the differences among different pixels, resulting in that the extracted features are not accurate enough. This letter proposes a spatial dynamic selection network for remote-sensing image fusion. A dynamic feature extraction module composed of multiple spatial dynamic blocks (SDBs) and cross-scale context connection blocks (CSCBs) is designed. The SDB can extract image features according to the input by different networks, and realize dynamic selection of pixel features. Since the spatial structure and spectral characteristic of each pixel are different, two complementary branches are designed in the SDB to extract different features, which improves the capability of feature extraction. Multiscale network structure is designed to obtain more abundant information and the CSCB is used to integrate the information of different scales. Experimental results on GeoEye-1 and WorldView-3 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

TI  - Influence of eddies and tropical cyclone heat potential on intensity changes of tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddies are known to play a crucial role in the sudden intensification of tropical cyclones. In this study, Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) data from satellite altimetry is utilized to investigate the role of eddies on tropical cyclones intensification in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) basin. SLA data obtained from Archiving Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Data in Oceanography (AVISO), Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential (TCHP) from National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and cyclone intensity data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) have been utilized to analyse and understand the impact of TCHP and eddies on 60 tropical cyclones in the NIO spanning the years 2001-2018. Out of these 60 cyclones, 38 were formed in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and 22 in the Arabian Sea (AS). From the analysis, it is found that nearly 40% cyclones are affected by Warm Core Eddy (WCE) generally intensifying them, 30% are influenced by Cold Core Eddy (CCE) that generally reduce cyclone intensities and the rest 30% are affected by TCHP variations (in the absence of eddies) in the NIO region during the study period. Cyclones which do not follow the established trend of intensifying due to WCEs or increasing TCHP; and diminishing owing to CCEs or TCHP decrease were found to be governed primarily by the Translational Speed of the cyclones. WCE are mostly present during the pre-monsoon season in the NIO (both BoB and AS). This analysis confirms that consideration of the underlying eddies in the cyclone track represented by SLA, TCHP variations, Translational Speed of cyclones and the ocean barrier layer are key factors that must be considered in forecasting cyclone intensity and track.

TI  - Rapid and large-scale mapping of flood inundation via integrating spaceborne synthetic aperture radar imagery with unsupervised deep learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has great potential for timely monitoring of flood information as it penetrates the clouds during flood events. Moreover, the proliferation of SAR satellites with high spatial and temporal resolution provides a tremendous opportunity to understand the flood risk and its quick response. However, traditional algorithms to extract flood inundation using SAR often require manual parameter tuning or data annotation, which presents a challenge for the rapid automated mapping of large and complex flooded scenarios. To address this issue, we proposed a segmentation algorithm for automatic flood mapping in near-real-time over vast areas and for all-weather conditions by integrating Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with an unsupervised machine learning approach named Felz-CNN. The algorithm consists of three phases: (i) super-pixel generation; (ii) convolutional neural network-based featurization; (iii) super-pixel aggregation. We evaluated the Felz-CNN algorithm by mapping flood inundation during the Yangtze River flood in 2020, covering a total study area of 1,140,300 km(2). When validated on fine-resolution Planet satellite imagery, the algorithm accurately identified flood extent with producer and user accuracy of 93% and 94%, respectively. The results are indicative of the usefulness of our unsupervised approach for the application of flood mapping. Meanwhile, we overlapped the post-disaster inundation map with a 10-m resolution global land cover map (FROM-GLC10) to assess the damages to different land cover types. Of these types, cropland and residential settlements were most severely affected, with inundation areas of 9,430.36 km(2) and 1,397.50 km(2), respectively, results that are in agreement with statistics from relevant agencies. Compared with traditional supervised classification algorithms that require time-consuming data annotation, our unsupervised algorithm can be deployed directly to high-performance computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine and PIE-Engine to generate a large-spatial map of flood-affected areas within minutes, without time-consuming data downloading and processing. Importantly, this efficiency enables the fast and effective monitoring of flood conditions to aid in disaster governance and mitigation globally.

TI  - Color Preference for Host-Seeking Activity of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> and <i>Culex pipiens</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A cue for long-range vision allows mosquitoes to identify hosts and differentiate the ecological niches (e.g., habitats). However, the visual factors involved in attracting mosquitoes to a host are complex and have not been fully understood.Therefore, we assessed color preference to Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex pipiens (Conquillett) as diurnal and nocturnal species, respectively, using seven fundamental colors including black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, and purple with each trap at 100 lux in a laboratory. We used a binary behavioral assay using the Mosquito Preference Index (MPI) as a preference ratio with a range of 0-1. Our analyses showed that Ae. albopictus had a greater response to black (MPIs, 0.7), followed closely by red, blue, and purple (MPIs, 0.6). We also found that red, blue, and purple were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of green (MPI, 0.5), white (MPI, 0.3), and yellow (MPI, 0.2). Similarly, the MPIs for Cx. pipiens were significantly higher at black and red (MPIs, 0.7; P < 0.05) compare to those of white and yellow (MPIs, 0.3; P < 0.05). The color preference of Ae. albopictus showed significant correlation to luminous intensities (L-value) (r = -0.640; P = 0.000) and blue intensities (b-value) (r = -0.372; P = 0.000) for all seven colors. In addition, Cx. pipiens negatively correlated (r = -0.703; P = 0.000) between color preference and L-value. Our analyses provide a greater understanding of how color plays a role in visual sensory stimuli, and how that could potentially affect mosquito host-seeking behavior.

AB  - As harmful algae blooms are increasing in frequency and magnitude, one goal of a new generation of higher spectral resolution satellite missions is to improve the potential of satellite optical data to monitor these events. A satellite-based algorithm proposed over two decades ago was used for the first time to monitor the extent and temporal evolution of a massive bloom of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra off Southern California during April and May 2020.The algorithm uses ultraviolet (UV) data that have only recently become available from the single ocean color sensor on the Japanese GCOM-C satellite. Dinoflagellates contain high concentrations of mycosporine-like amino acids and release colored dissolved organic matter, both of which absorb strongly in the UV part of the spectrum. Ratios <1 of remote sensing reflectance of the UV band at 380 nm to that of the blue band at 443 nm were used as an indicator of the dinoflagellate bloom. The satellite data indicated that an observed, long, and narrow nearshore band of elevated chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, extending from northern Baja to Santa Monica Bay, was dominated by L. polyedra. In other high Chl-a regions, the ratios were >1, consistent with historical observations showing a sharp transition from dinoflagellate- to diatom-dominated waters in these areas. UV bands are thus potentially useful in the remote sensing of phytoplankton blooms but are currently available only from a single ocean color sensor. As several new satellites such as the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and marine Ecosystem mission will include UV bands, new algorithms using these bands are needed to enable better monitoring of blooms, especially potentially harmful algal blooms, across large spatiotemporal scales.

TI  - Care-seeking behaviour and socio-economic burden associated with uncomplicated malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to estimate the socio-economic costs of uncomplicated malaria and to explore health care-seeking behaviours that are likely to influence these costs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country ranked worldwide as the second most affected by malaria.MethodsIn 2017, a cross-sectional survey included patients with uncomplicated malaria in 64 healthcare facilities from 10 sentinel sites of the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) in the DRC. A standard questionnaire was used to assess health care-seeking behaviours of patients. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) and disutility weights (DW) of illness were evaluated by using the EuroQol Group's descriptive system (EQ-5D-3L) and its visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Malaria costs were estimated from a patient's perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) evaluated the uncertainty around the cost estimates. Generalized regression models were fitted to assess the effect of potential predictive factors on the time lost and the DW during illness.ResultsIn total, 1080 patients (age: 13.114 years; M/F ratio: 1.1) were included. The average total costs amounted to US$ 36.3 [95% CI 35.5-37.2] per malaria episode, including US$ 16.7 [95% CI 16.3-17.1] as direct costs and US$ 19.6 [95% CI 18.9-20.3] indirect costs. During care seeking, economically active patients and their relatives lost respectively 3.3 +/- 1.8 and 3.4 +/- 2.1 working days. This time loss occurred mostly at the pre-hospital stage and was the parameter associated the most with the uncertainty around malaria cost estimates. Patients self-rated an average 0.36 +/- 0.2 DW and an average 0.62 +/- 0.3 EQ-5D index score per episode. A lack of health insurance coverage (896 out of 1080; 82.9%) incurred substantially higher costs, lower quality of life, and heavier DW while leading to longer time lost during illness. Residing in rural areas incurred a disproportionally higher socioeconomic burden of uncomplicated malaria with longer time lost due to illness and limited access to health insurance mechanisms.Conclusion Uncomplicated malaria is associated with high economic costs of care in the DRC. Efforts to reduce the cost-of-illness should target time lost at the pre-hospital stage and social disparities in the population, while reinforcing measures for malaria control in the country.

TI  - Structural controls on the emplacement of scoria cones and rhyolite domes of the western Afar margin, Ethiopia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Matured continental rift zones that imprint the complete cycle of rifting are rare deformation environments in the globe. The western Afar margin is one that shows such a complete process. This research is aimed to understand the development of the lower part of the western Afar margin and determine the nature of transfer zones that host the mega dike injections, the elliptical scoria cones, and rhyolitic domes around Gulina area. To do so, structural analyses were conducted using intensive field measurements, Landsat ETM+, and SPOT imageries, and digital elevation models (DEM) data to comprehend chronologically distinct structures and magmatic series. The result shows that marginal structures are represented by older rift bounding NNW-SSE trending faults and younger NE-SW oriented transverse structures. Mode of emplacement of these two structurally and chronologically distinct structures are found associated with the evolution of the marginal magmatic series. The study has also investigated NE-SW trending offset faults and NE-SW striking transversal structures. Moreover, this work shows that the marginal structures are inactive but the younger structures (mega dikes and scoria cones are active and controlled by regional transversal structures that separate the Erta'Ale range and Tendaho-MandaHararo rift segment). From the recognition of the cross-cutting relationship, the marginal faults are identified as firstgeneration fractures, whereas the deformed domical silicified rhyolite outcrops situated in the marginal areas are classified under the second generation. The preserved rhyolite dome in the rift floor, the scoria cones, rift floor fractures, and dikes are found to be third-generation structures.

TI  - Optimization of urban land cover classification using an improved Elephant Herding Optimization algorithm and random forest classifier
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to provide a novel approach for improving urban land cover classification accuracy, which combines the Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm as a meta-heuristic optimization method with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed approach involves both classifier hyperparameter tuning and feature selection for a data set of a selected urban area. The EHO and the RF algorithms were both utilized in a hybrid system (EHO-RF) to find an optimal classification model with a tuned set of hyperparameters and features (predictor variables). EHO-RF model tuning was followed by backward feature elimination using RF, which further reduced data dimensionality. This work also combines two well-known optimization and feature selection algorithms to enhance accuracy assessment of the proposed approach. Grid search optimization was combined with Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) algorithm to build an optimization system (Grid-VSURF) that is similar to the workflow of EHO-RF. Objective functions for both Grid-VSURF and EHO-RF were designed to perform 10-fold cross-validation to reduce over-fitting. An area in Deerfield Beach city, Florida, USA, was selected as the study area representing an urban land cover. The testing dataset used in this study represents a performance benchmarking dataset, which has been utilized in many studies. EHO-RF results showed a significant improvement with an overall map accuracy of 83.83%, compared with Grid-VSURF results with an overall map accuracy of 74.75%. The number of input features was significantly reduced by both approaches with 82.30% reduction using EHO-RF with backward elimination and 89.70% reduction using Grid-VSURF.

TI  - Estimating discharges for poorly gauged river basin using ensemble learning regression with satellite altimetry data and a hydrologic model
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo River is one of the least studied basins although it is the world's second largest in size (similar to 3.7 million km(2)) and discharge (Q) (similar to 40,600 m(3) s(-1)). Using remote sensing data and a hydrologic model, previous studies have successfully estimated Q of the Congo River at Brazzaville-Kinshasa stations with an accuracy of 10-40%. However, those studies depended on only a hydrologic model or estimated Q using remotely sensed data with a single rating curve. Recently, Kim et al. (2019) has also successfully applied the ensemble learning regression method, which is one of the machine learning techniques, to estimate Q (termed as ELQ) by linearly combining several rating curves over different locations. The study has estimated Q at the Brazzaville station with relative root-mean-square error (RRMSEs) of 7.17/5.53% for training/validation datasets whose temporal resolutions are 35-day for the period from 2002 to 2010. However, ELQ still requires in-situ Q data in order to train base learners and obtain their weights. In this study, we present a study estimating daily Q by applying ELQ with satellite altimetry data and the hydrologic-hydraulic Hillslope River Routing (HRR) model for the Congo River. We parameterized our model with the HRR-derived Q ((Q) over cap (HRR)) in training/validation datasets without the aid of in-situ Q. ELQ-derived Q ((Q) over cap (ELQ)) has not been calibrated or scaled with in-situ Q data in training/validation datasets. However, the HRR model has been calibrated to mean monthly historical gauge measurements (1903-1990). (Q) over cap (HRR) showed RRMSEs of 15.72/18.00% for training/validation datasets compared with daily in-situ Q data at the Kinshasa station spanning from November 2002 to September 2010. We used the Basic Ensemble Method (f(BEM)), which employs the uniformly distributed weights in ELQ process, that can provide improved estimates of Q (Q) over cap (ELQ) using f(BEM) showed RRMSE of 11.32/9.05% on average for training/validation datasets. Moreover, we introduced the method generating more accurate ELQ using the ensemble mean of f(BEM) ((f(BEM)) over bar) which yielded RRMSEs of 7-10%. This study demonstrates that ELQ can provide more accurate daily Q using satellite altimetry data and a hydrologic model for poorly gauged river basins. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Long-term change in aerosol characteristics over Indo-Gangetic Basin: How significant is the impact of emerging anthropogenic activities?
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term aerosol characteristics were assessed over the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) using satellite-derived aerosol properties from January 2007 to December 2017. The study shows steadily high aerosol optical depth (AOD -0.7) with a decadal increasing trend (-20%) over the IGB. Angstrom exponent (AE) shows a relatively large increasing trend at Lucknow in the central IGB (-25%) as compared to Delhi in the north-west IGB (-18%), which suggests relative increase in fine-mode aerosols at Lucknow (-30%). Though, single scattering albedo (SSA) does not show any considerable decadal trend at both the stations, the ultraviolet-aerosol index (UV-AI) shows an increasing trend, with a pronounced increase at Delhi (-26%) compared to Lucknow (-20%). Result suggests relative dominance of absorbing dust aerosols over Delhi. Further, to understand the impact of emerging activities, analyses were done in two sub-periods: 2007-2012 and 2013-2017. Interestingly, a relative increasing trend in AOD (-31%) is observed at Delhi compared to Lucknow during 2007-2012, which was observed at Lucknow (-22%) during 2013-2017. The emission inventory corroborates with the trend and variability of optical properties for different sub-periods, and results show intense development activities in the region have an influence on vertical as well as horizontal aerosol load.
