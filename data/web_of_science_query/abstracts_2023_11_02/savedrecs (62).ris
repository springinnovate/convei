TI  - Management in primary care at the time of a suicide attempt and its impact on care post-suicide attempt: an observational study in the French GP sentinel surveillance system
T2  - BMC FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We aimed to describe primary care management at the time of a suicide attempt (SA) and after the SA. Methods An observational (cross-sectional) study was conducted among 166 sentinel GPs within France (a non-gatekeeping country) between 2013 and 2017 for all GP's patients who attempted suicide. Measurements: frequency of patients 1) managed by the GP at the time of the SA, 2) addressed to an emergency department (ED), 3) without care at the time of the SA, and 4) managed by the GP after the SA and factors associated with GP management at the time of and after the SA. Results Three hundred twenty-one SAs were reported, of which N = 95 (29.6%) were managed by the GP at the time of the SA, N = (70.5%) were referred to an ED, and N = (27.4%) remained at home. Forty-eight (14.9%) patients did not receive any care at the time of the SA and 178 (55.4%) were managed directly by an ED. GPs were more likely to be involved in management of the patient at the time of the SA if they were younger (39.2% for patients < 34 years old; 22.9% for those 35 to 54 years old, and 30.3% for those more than 55 years old p = 0.02) or the SA involved a firearm or self-cutting (51.9%) versus those involving drugs (23.7%); p = 0.006). After the SA, GPs managed 174 patients (54.2%), more often (60%) when they provided care at home at the time of the SA, p = 0.04; 1.87 [1.07; 3.35]. No other factor was associated with management by GPs after the SA. Conclusions The study faced limitations: data were not available for patients managed solely by specialists during their SA and results may not be generalisable to countries with a stronger gatekeeping system. We concluded that GPs are involved in the management of patients at the time of a SA for a third of patients. EDs are the major provider of care at that time. Half patients consulted GPs after the SA and connections between GPs and ED upon discharge should be improved.

TI  - Monitoring land surface thermal environments under the background of landscape patterns in arid regions: A case study in Aksu river basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is defined as an important indicator in the formation and evolution of dimate. In some cases, changes in landscape patterns affect LST, even more than the contribution of greenhouse gases. Although much work has been done with respect to the correlations between urban development and thermal environment dynamics, the related questions regarding relationships between LST and landscape patterns in arid regions are not thoroughly considered. Understanding these questions is important in climate change and land planning. The objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal variations of ST by distribution index (DI) and Mann-Kendall mutation analysis method and to quantify the relationships between landscape patterns, climatic factors, topographic factors, and the land surface thermal environment (LSTE) by the ordinary linear regressions (OLS) model. The landscape patterns dataset, which was validated by a field trip, was extracted from the Land satellite (Landsat) TM/OLI images by the Random Forest methodology in ArcGIS software. The MODIS/LST product was validated by the "Monthly dataset of China's surface climate" and a field trip. Annual LST increased by 0.54 degrees C (23.15 degrees C in 2000 and 23.79 degrees C in 2015). In different landscape patterns, the percentage of areas with a high level of LST showed a significant difference. In barren land, the highest area proportion for the high LST level was larger than in other landscape patterns. Meanwhile, the area of low LST was mainly concentrated in water bodies. Considerable changes have occurred in landscape patterns, in which the most noteworthy was cultivated land encroaching on grass land (3708.44 km(2)). The composition of landscape patterns was more important than distribution in determining the region's LST. These findings provide valuable information for land planners dealing with climate change and ecosystem conservation in arid regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Semi-Automated Surveillance Algorithm for Cardiac Device Infections: Insights from the VA CART program
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Procedure-related cardiac electronic implantable device (CIED) infections have high morbidity and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for infection prevention efforts to include electrophysiology procedures. We developed and validated a semi-automated algorithm based on structured electronic health records data to reliably identify CIED infections. A sample of CIED procedures entered into the Veterans' Health Administration Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking program from FY 2008-2015 was reviewed for the presence of CIED infection. This sample was then randomly divided into training (2/3) validation sets (1/3). The training set was used to develop a detection algorithm containing structured variables mapped from the clinical pathways of CIED infection. Performance of this algorithm was evaluated using the validation set. 2,107 unique CIED procedures from a cohort of 5,753 underwent manual review; 97 CIED infections (4.6%) were identified. Variables strongly associated with true infections included presence of a microbiology order, billing codes for surgical site infections and post-procedural antibiotic prescriptions. The combined algorithm to detect infection demonstrated high c-statistic (0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.98), sensitivity (87.9%) and specificity (90.3%) in the validation data. Structured variables derived from clinical pathways can guide development of a semi-automated detection tool to surveil for CIED infection.

TI  - An assessment of adult mosquito collection techniques for studying species abundance and diversity in Maferinyah, Guinea
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Several mosquito collection methods are routinely used in vector control programmes. However, they target different behaviours causing bias in estimation of species diversity and abundance. Given the paucity of mosquito trap data in West Africa, we compared the performance of five trap-lure combinations and Human Landing Catches (HLCs) in Guinea. Methods CDC light traps (LT), BG sentinel 2 traps (BG2T), gravid traps (GT) and Stealth traps (ST) were compared in a 5 x 5 Latin Square design in three villages in Guinea between June and July 2018. The ST, a portable trap which performs similarly to a LT but incorporates LEDs and incandescent light, was included since it has not been widely tested. BG2T were used with BG and MB5 lures instead of CO2 to test the efficacy of these attractants. HLCs were performed for 5 nights, but not as part of the Latin Square. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model was applied to compare the effect of the traps, sites and collection times on mosquito abundance. Species identification was confirmed using PCR-based analysis and Sanger sequencing. Results A total of 10,610 mosquitoes were captured across five traps. ST collected significantly more mosquitoes (7096) than the rest of the traps, but resulted in a higher number of damaged specimens. ST and BG2T collected the highest numbers of Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, respectively. HLCs captured predominantly An. coluzzii (41%) and hybrids of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii (36%) in contrast to the five traps, which captured predominantly An. melas (83%). The rural site (Senguelen) presented the highest abundance of mosquitoes and overall diversity in comparison with Fandie (semi-rural) and Maferinyah Centre I (semi-urban). Our results confirm the presence of four species for the first time in Guinea. Conclusions ST collected the highest number of mosquitoes suggesting this trap may play an important role for mosquito surveillance in Guinea and similar sites in West Africa. We recommend the incorporation of molecular tools in entomological studies since they have helped to identify 25 mosquito species in this area.

TI  - Nanoparticles from Ancient Ink Endowing a Green and Effective Strategy for Cancer Photothermal Therapy in the Second Near-Infrared Window
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Photothermal therapy (PTT) in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1350 nm) has presented great superiority in cancer treatment recently. However, it is generally limited to a few photothermal agents and most of them often suffer from intricate design and complicated synthesis. Herein, by subtly extracting nanoparticles from ancient ink (AINPs), a versatile AINP dispersion with definite ingredients, good biosafety, and excellent photothermal effect in the NIR-II window was obtained. In vivo trials demonstrated that the obtained AINP dispersion provides a promising alternative for tumor sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. Besides, under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging, the metastatic SLNs could be accurately eliminated by NIR-II laser irradiation. The preliminary biosafety of AINP dispersion has also been systematically confirmed. Therefore, we believe this work would provide a green and effective strategy for PTT of tumor in the NIR-II window.

TI  - Sentinel event reviews in the criminal justice system: a review of the literature
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE STUDIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve is essential to the safety of our citizens. Relationships between police and communities have, however, become increasingly strained, with reports of deadly events and wrongful convictions filling the television, newspapers, and the Internet. While the model of conducting internal investigations to determine blame and penalize the individuals involved has been used for years, a new paradigm to bring systemic change is increasingly being embraced by the criminal justice field. Historically used in other disciplines, sentinel event reviews have been employed to understand organizational failures. Multiple key community stakeholders gather to conduct a root cause analysis, which is an empirical approach that involves data collection to understand the systems-level causes of organizational events. The purpose of this paper is to examine the literature on sentinel event reviews in the criminal justice system, borrowing heavily from other disciplines where they are already well-established. We then examine the literature on organizational adoption, since the ultimate goal of sentinel event reviews is to lead to stronger systems that can learn from systemic mistakes and allow the dissemination of best practices to benefit both law enforcement and the individuals they serve.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamic land cover changes and their impacts on the urban thermal environment in the Chittagong metropolitan area, Bangladesh
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization and industrialization along with the expansion of cities in developing countries like Bangladesh converting vegetation and bare land into built-up area that remarkably boost up the land surface temperature (LST). This study has been conducted for correlating and monitoring the changes of landuse-landcover change (LULC) and LST of rapidly expanding Chittagong metropolitan area from 1989 to 2018 utilizing four Landsat satellite images (TM, ETM+, OLI, and TIRS). The Present study combines the techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to find out the spatial variation of LST and identify its relationship with LULC. Supervised classification technique has been employed in ERDAS IMAGINE 14.0 software to retrieve LULC data. The images of the study area were categorized into four different classes namely vegetation, urban structures, bared lands and water bodies. LSTs were estimated using the single thermal infrared band of Landsat TM, ETM+, and the band 10 and 11 of the TIRS sensor's image for the split-window algorithm method. Concerning the relationship between LULC and LST, it has been found that vegetation and water bodies shows lowest LST while bared lands and urban structures indicates highest LST. LULC analysis shows a dramatic increase in urban structures (from 20.83 to 58.93%), decrease in vegetation (from 56.54 to 20.24%) and bared lands (from 16.67 to 11.90%) and a further small increase in water bodies after the 80s, because of digging new ponds. LST in the study area has been increasing as high-temperature LU types have increased and low temperature LU types have decreased. Consequently, the mean annual temperature showed 6.5 degrees C increase, the minimum and maximum LST increased by 9 degrees C and 4 degrees C throughout the study period. The highest maximum and lowest minimum LST has found 40 degrees C during the years of 2010 to 2018 and 15 degrees C in the year of 1989, respectively. The study will assist the decision-maker to understand the impacts of unplanned urbanization for future city planning and urban management.

TI  - GIS-based modelling reveals the fate of antlion habitats in the Deliblato Sands
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deliblato Sands Special Nature Reserve (DSSNR; Vojvodina, Serbia) is facing a fast successional process. Open sand steppe habitats, considered as regional biodiversity hotspots, have drastically decreased over the last 25 years. This study combines multi-temporal and -spectral remotely sensed data, in-situ sampling techniques and geospatial modelling procedures to estimate and predict the potential development of open habitats and their biota from the perspective of antlions (Neuroptera, Myrmeleontidae). It was confirmed that vegetation density increased in all parts of the study area between 1992 and 2017. Climate change, manifested in the mean annual precipitation amount, significantly contributes to the speed of succession that could be completed within a 50-year period. Open grassland habitats could reach an alarming fragmentation rate by 2075 (covering 50 times less area than today), according to selected global climate models and emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). However, M. trigrammus could probably survive in the DSSNR until the first half of the century, but its subsequent fate is very uncertain. The information provided in this study can serve for effective management of sand steppes, and antlions should be considered important indicators for conservation monitoring and planning.

TI  - Tick burden on European roe deer (<i>Capreolus capreolus</i>) from Saxony, Germany, and detection of tick-borne encephalitis virus in attached ticks
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Germany is known as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) risk area; however, the north of the country is almost free of human TBE cases. Due to its location in the transition zone between TBE risk areas and areas with only sporadic cases, Saxony is of importance in the surveillance of TBE. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), showing high seroprevalence of TBE virus (TBEV) antibodies, are considered to be sentinels for TBE risk assessment. Thus, roe deer could be used as indicators helping to better understand the focality of the TBEV in nature and as a possible source to isolate TBEV. Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine roe deer coats for the presence of ticks to establish the tick burden and to detect the TBEV in attached ticks. One hundred thirty-four roe deer coats were provided by hunters from the Hunting Association in Saxony (August 2017-January 2019). The coats were frozen at - 80 degrees C and after de-freezing examined on both sides-inside and outside. Attached and nonattached ticks were collected, morphologically identified and tested using real-time RT-PCR for the presence of TBEV. In total, 1279 ticks were found on 48 coats. The predominant species was Ixodes ricinus (99.76%; n = 1276). Three remaining specimens were Ixodes spp. (0.16%, 1 female and 1 nymph) and Dermacentor reticulatus (0.08%, 1 male). The average infestation rate was 26.7 (SD = 69.5), with maximum of 439 ticks per animal. Females were the dominant life stage of ticks (n = 536; 42%), followed by nymphs (n = 397; n = 31.1%), males (n = 175; 13.7%), and larvae (n = 168; 13.2%). Only half of collected ticks were attached (n = 662; 51.8%). TBEV was detected only in one tick out of 1279 tested ticks. It was a female infesting a roe deer from Saxon Switzerland-East Ore Mountain. The results show that the method used in this study is not sufficient as a sentinel marker to predict TBEV spreading in nature. Although previous studies demonstrated the usefulness of serological testing of roe deer in order to trace TBE-endemic regions, using ticks attached to them to get virus isolates is not productive.

TI  - Subsidence associated with oil extraction, measured from time series analysis of Sentinel-1 data: case study of the Patos-Marinza oil field, Albania
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Patos-Marinza oil field in central Albania (40.71 degrees N, 19.61 degrees E), operated since 1939, is one of the largest onshore oil fields in Europe. More than 7 million oil barrels are extracted every year from the Messinian sandstone formations of the Durres Basin in the Albanian Peri-Adriatic Depression by the Bankers Petroleum Ltd. (hereafter Bankers), which has been operating the field since 2004.In this study, we take advantage of the new Sentinel-1 radar images acquired every 6 to 12 d over Albania to measure the surface displacement in the Myzeqeja plain and in the Patos-Marinza oil field in particular. Images from two ascending and descending tracks covering the area are processed through a radar interferometry (InSAR) time series analysis over the 2014 to 2018 time span, providing consistent average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity maps and displacement time series.The regional deformation field exhibits a slow subsidence of the entire basin relative to the highlands (at rates of 2.5 mm yr(-1)) that we interpret as a combination of natural and human-induced compaction. This broad picture is complicated by a very strong local subsidence signal with rates as high as 15 mm yr(-1) that spatially correlates with the Patos-Marinza oil field and is maximal in the zone holding most of the operating wells, where enhanced oil recovery techniques are used.The striking spatial correlation between the maximum subsidence area and the active wells, as seen from optical images, argues in favor of surface deformation induced by oil extraction. This deformation is well reproduced by elastic models mimicking the basin and reservoir compaction using planar negative tensile (closing) dislocations. Such modeling provides a first-order estimation of the volumetric deflation rate in the oil reservoir (similar to 0.2 Mm(3) yr(-1)), and it suggests that concurrent injection activity has been conducted in the central part of the field where small uplift is observed. Our new InSAR-derived evidence of significant surface strain associated with the oil field operations raises the question of the potential impact of these operations on the local seismicity. A slight increase in the nearby released seismic moment rate seems to be observed since 2009, shortly after the oil field reactivation. However, without further seismological monitoring of the area and longer InSAR time series, this question will remain open.

TI  - Spatiotemporal reconstruction of MODIS land surface temperature with the help of GLDAS product using kernel-based nonparametric data assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal inconsistency in MODIS land surface temperature (LST), one of the most widely used geospatial data parameters, is a concern for its application in various studies. Moreover, there are limited methods that can address spatiotemporal reconstruction of LST in diverse physiography. The use of kernel-based spatiotemporal assimilation in a multitemporal approach to reconstruct LST in a complex physiographic region, northeast India, is addressed. Global land skin temperature (Ts) from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) is chosen as a temporal covariate for MODIS LST due to its consistent temporal resolution. Considering the high temporal correlation between GLDAS Ts and MODIS LST, temporal assimilation is done in the first stage followed by spatial assimilation in the second stage. Due to data gaps, a kernel-based nonparametric estimator is adopted to map the spatiotemporal distribution and reconstruct LST with spatiotemporal consistency. This approach shows satisfactory performance in restoration of spatial variation in the study area with a coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.98), root mean square error (RMSE = 0.61 K), and absolute value of bias (B = 0.22 K). Also, the credibility of reconstructed LST from this method is found to be as good as the baseline data (MODIS LST) given that there is no severe data deficiency with uneven spatial availability in the baseline data itself. Comparison of gap-filled LST showed positive correlation with ground-based measurements (average R = 0.71), reflecting decent agreement with seasonality. Hence, the kernel-based nonparametric assimilation could be used to reconstruct LST using a multitemporal approach in complex physiographic regions, which could be used to fill the spatiotemporal data gaps and increase data consistency in MODIS LST.

TI  - Proposing a conceptual framework of spiritual care competence for Chinese nurses
T2  - NURSING & HEALTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Spiritual care competence of nurses is crucial to satisfy the spiritual needs of the clients, but the dearth of conceptual frameworks has hindered the clarification of the construct, especially for nurses in the People's Republic of China. This article developed a 3*3*3 matrix framework to clarify the components of spiritual care competence for Chinese nurses through the synthesis of existing empirical and theoretical work, which includes three aspects (awareness, understanding, and application) on three levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal) of three contents of spirituality (namely, worldview, connectedness, and transcendence). The proposed framework can be used as a model to promote spiritual care competence of nurses in China. Adoption of the framework to guide studies would allow for the design of interventions for the attainment of this competence.

TI  - Intercomparison and Validation of MIRS, MSPPS, and IMS Snow Cover Products
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the agreement between automated snow products generated from satellite observations in the microwave bands within NESDIS Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MIRS) and Microwave Surface and Precipitation Products System (MSPPS), on the one hand, and snow cover maps produced with manual input by the NOAA's Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), on the other. MIRS uses physically based retrievals of atmospheric and surface state parameters to provide daily global maps of snow cover and snow water equivalent at 50 km resolution. The older MSPPS delivers daily global maps at the spatial resolution of 45 km and utilizes mostly simple empirical algorithms to retrieve information. IMS daily maps of snow and sea ice cover for the Northern Hemisphere are produced interactively through the analysis of satellite imagery in the visible, infrared, and microwave spectral bands. We compare the performances of these products across the Northern Hemisphere for 2014-2017, using IMS as the standard. In this intercomparison, the daily overall agreement of the automated snow products with IMS ranges between 88% and 99% for MIRS and 87% and 99% for MSPPS. However, daily snow sensitivity is lower, ranging between 36% and 90% for MIRS and 26% and 91% for MSPPS. We analyze this disagreement rate as a function of terrain and land cover type, finding that, relative to IMS, MIRS shows fewer false positives but more false negatives than MSPPS over high elevation and grassland areas.

TI  - Use of vegetation change tracker, spatial analysis, and random forest regression to assess the evolution of plantation stand age in Southeast China
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message By integrating vegetation change tracker (VCT), spatial analysis (SA), and random forest regression (RF), the spectral-temporal patterns of forest stand age were mapped for three typical plantations in Southern China. The spectral-temporal distribution of age structure indicated that the plantation stands in the study area were increasingly aging. Context Plantations play a major role in China for ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration. Mapping plantation stand age distributions is essential for developing sustainable plantation forest management plans. Aims The purpose of this study was to propose two new remote sensing based models for mapping plantation ages and to test the model feasibility and accuracy in determining the spectral-temporal patterns of forest ages. Methods We first integrated vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm and spatial analysis (VCT-SA) for the pixels that were disturbed at least once from 1987 to 2017, and integrated VCT and random forest (VCT-RF) for the pixels were not disturbed during the study period. Then the forest age of these two parts were merged separately to generate annual forest age. Results The spectral-temporal (30-m resolution, from 1987 to 2017) of forest age for the three typical plantations in Lishui were generated. The results indicated that the plantation stands in our large study area were increasingly aging. Conclusion Our results revealed that it is reasonable to derive the distribution of plantation stand ages from combined remote sensing models. Besides, we confirmed that the stand ages of the plantations in our large study area of Lishui City are on the rise as the result of forest protection policies.

TI  - 8q24 genetic variation and comprehensive haplotypes altering familial risk of prostate cancer
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 8q24 genomic locus is tied to the origin of numerous cancers. We investigate its contribution to hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) in independent study populations of the Nashville Familial Prostate Cancer Study and International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (combined: 2,836 HPC cases, 2,206 controls of European ancestry). Here we report 433 variants concordantly associated with HPC in both study populations, accounting for 9% of heritability and modifying age of diagnosis as well as aggressiveness; 183 reach genome-wide significance. The variants comprehensively distinguish independent risk-altering haplotypes overlapping the 648kb locus (three protective, and four risk (peak odds ratios: 1.5, 4, 5, and 22)). Sequence of the near-Mendelian haplotype reveals eleven causal mutation candidates. We introduce a linkage disequilibrium-based algorithm discerning eight independent sentinel variants, carrying considerable risk prediction ability (AUC=0.625) for a single locus. These findings elucidate 8q24 locus structure and correlates for clinical prediction of prostate cancer risk.

TI  - Variation of net primary productivity and its drivers in China's forests during 2000-2018
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Net primary productivity (NPP) in forests plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, it is not well known about the increase rate of China's forest NPP, and there are different opinions about the key factors controlling the variability of forest NPP. Methods This paper established a statistics-based multiple regression model to estimate forest NPP, using the observed NPP, meteorological and remote sensing data in five major forest ecosystems. The fluctuation values of NPP and environment variables were extracted to identify the key variables influencing the variation of forest NPP by correlation analysis. Results The long-term trends and annual fluctuations of forest NPP between 2000 and 2018 were examined. The results showed a significant increase in forest NPP for all five forest ecosystems, with an average rise of 5.2 gC center dot m(- 2)center dot year(- 1) over China. Over 90% of the forest area had an increasing NPP range of 0-161 gC center dot m(- 2)center dot year(- 1). Forest NPP had an interannual fluctuation of 50-269 gC center dot m(- 2)center dot year(- 1) for the five major forest ecosystems. The evergreen broadleaf forest had the largest fluctuation. The variability in forest NPP was caused mainly by variations in precipitation, then by temperature fluctuations. Conclusions All five forest ecosystems in China exhibited a significant increasing NPP along with annual fluctuations evidently during 2000-2018. The variations in China's forest NPP were controlled mainly by changes in precipitation.

TI  - Malignant melanoma
T2  - PATHOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that originates from cells of the melanocytic lineage and is associated with an invasive growth pattern and early spread. Besides endogenous risk factors such as fair skin type or genetic disposition for the formation of multiple nevi, exposure to ultraviolet light is the most important exogenous risk factor. Treatment of patients with primary tumors includes the complete excision of the primary lesion with appropriate safety margins and in patients with an increased risk of metastasis sentinel lymph node excision. Prognostically significant parameters are the Breslow invasion depth, ulceration of the primary lesion, and sentinel lymph node status. Systemic therapy plays an important role in the adjuvant setting and for inoperable tumors. Depending on the indication and the molecular profile of the tumor tissue, immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted kinase inhibitors can be used and may result in a significant prolongation of survival times.

TI  - Combining national survey with facility-based HIV testing data to obtain more accurate estimate of HIV prevalence in districts in Uganda
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background National or regional population-based HIV prevalence surveys have small sample sizes at district or sub-district levels; this leads to wide confidence intervals when estimating HIV prevalence at district level for programme monitoring and decision making. Health facility programme data, collected during service delivery is widely available, but since people self-select for HIV testing, HIV prevalence estimates based on it, is subject to selection bias. We present a statistical annealing technique, Hybrid Prevalence Estimation (HPE), that combines a small population-based survey sample with a facility-based sample to generate district level HIV prevalence estimates with associated confidence intervals. Methods We apply the HPE methodology to combine the 2011 Uganda AIDS indicator survey with the 2011 health facility HIV testing data to obtain HIV prevalence estimates for districts in Uganda. Multilevel logistic regression was used to obtain the propensity of testing for HIV in a health facility, and the propensity to test was used to combine the population survey and health facility HIV testing data to obtain the HPEs. We assessed comparability of the HPEs and survey-based estimates using Bland Altman analysis. Results The estimates ranged from 0.012 to 0.178 and had narrower confidence intervals compared to survey-based estimates. The average difference between HPEs and population survey estimates was 0.00 (95% CI: - 0.04, 0.04). The HPE standard errors were 28.9% (95% CI: 23.4-34.4) reduced, compared to survey-based standard errors. Overall reduction in HPE standard errors compared survey-based standard errors ranged from 5.4 to 95%. Conclusions Facility data can be combined with population survey data to obtain more accurate HIV prevalence estimates for geographical areas with small population survey sample sizes. We recommend use of the methodology by district level managers to obtain more accurate HIV prevalence estimates to guide decision making without incurring additional data collection costs.

TI  - S5P TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> slant column retrieval: method, stability, uncertainties and comparisons with OMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, launched on 13 October 2017, provides measurements of atmospheric trace gases and of cloud and aerosol properties at an unprecedented spatial resolution of approximately 7 x 3.5 km(2) (approx. 5.5 x 3.5 km(2) as of 6 August 2019), achieving near-global coverage in 1 d. The retrieval of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations is a three-step procedure: slant column density (SCD) retrieval, separation of the SCD in its stratospheric and tropospheric components, and conversion of these into vertical column densities. This study focusses on the TROPOMI NO2 SCD retrieval: the retrieval method used, the stability of the SCDs and the SCD uncertainties, and a comparison with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 SCDs.The statistical uncertainty, based on the spatial variability of the SCDs over a remote Pacific Ocean sector, is 8.63 mu mol m(-2) for all pixels (9.45 mu mol m(-2) for clear-sky pixels), which is very stable over time and some 30% less than the long-term average over OMI-QA4ECV data (since the pixel size reduction TROPOMI uncertainties are similar to 8% larger). The SCD uncertainty reported by the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) fit is about 10% larger than the statistical uncertainty, while for OMI-QA4ECV the DOAS uncertainty is some 20% larger than its statistical uncertainty. Comparison of the SCDs themselves over the Pacific Ocean, averaged over 1 month, shows that TROPOMI is about 5% higher than OMI-QA4ECV, which seems to be due mainly to the use of the so-called intensity offset correction in OMI-QA4ECV but not in TROPOMI: turning that correction off means about 5% higher SCDs. The row-to-row variation in the SCDs of TROPOMI, the "stripe amplitude", is 2.15 mu mol m(-2), while for OMI-QA4ECV it is a factor of similar to 2 (similar to 5) larger in 2005 (2018); still, a so-called stripe correction of this non-physical across-track variation is useful for TROPOMI data. In short, TROPOMI shows a superior performance compared with OMI-QA4ECV and operates as anticipated from instrument specifications.The TROPOMI data used in this study cover 30 April 2018 up to 31 January 2020.

TI  - 'The Backward Will Be Beaten': Historical Lesson, Security, and Nationalism in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - What has China learned from the 'Century of Humiliation'? In China's mnemonic practices, 'the backward will be beaten,' which attributes the nation's humiliation experiences to economic, military, and technological backwardness, is the most significant 'lesson from past' required to be remembered. Bridging the literatures on memory, nationalism, and International Relations (IR), this study conducts a detailed analysis of the making of 'the backward will be beaten' and examines how it helps shape China's perception of national security based on a competitive worldview and its associated nationalist visions. This study also identifies alternative discourses that challenge the dominant historical lesson by intellectuals and netizens. It contributes to a nuanced understanding of the collective memory of the Century of Humiliation and its implications for Chinese nationalism and foreign relations.

TI  - Efficacy of positron emission tomography and computed tomography in clinical staging of cutaneous malignant melanoma
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate staging is very important for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment for malignant melanoma (MM). The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in staging MM. Patients diagnosed with MM who then underwent PET/CT metastasis before treatment were assessed retrospectively. For each patient, the following variables were recorded: Breslow thickness, Clark's level, number of mitoses, the presence of ulceration detected in the pathology report, and the presence of lymph nodes and/or distant metastases detected by PET/CT. The pathology and PET/CT reports of 139 patients (79 female and 60 male) were retrospectively evaluated for staging after MM diagnosis. Patients with a Breslow thickness greater than 3.4 mm and Clark's level of 4 to 5 were found to be statistically significantly higher with regional lymph node metastasis after PET/CT scans. Patients with Breslow thickness greater than 2.85 mm and Clark's level of 4 to 5 were found to be statistically significantly higher with distant metastasis after PET/CT scan. The results of our study suggest that PET/CT imaging for metastasis scanning, starting with T2 patients, may be used in MM staging to reduce the need for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and lymph node dissection.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive urban growth has led to degradation in ecosystems in most underdeveloped countries. Using Landsat data and combination of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, extent and trends of variations in the urban environment of Odaw River Basin (ORB) in Accra from 1991 to 2016 were assessed. Evaluation of land-use and land-cover (LULC) assessment of revealed that the ORB has been subjected to four diverse rates of land degradation during the periods of 1991, 2002, 2011, and 2016. This is as a result of upsurge in settlement of about 238.20%. The Markov chain and cellular automation integrated model simulated the 2016 LULC patterns successfully due to the results of the comparison with the classified 2016 LULC. The expected LULC patterns for 2030 revealed that land degradation will be substantial in the northern, western, and the eastern portions of ORB where open forest, bare land, and closed forest are, respectively, transformed to settlement. These outcomes will provide a reference base for further research on hydrological response to the changing land use and land cover while helping the environmentalist fight against flooding in the study area.

TI  - Dried Blood Spot Sampling of Landlocked Arctic Char (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>) for Estimating Mercury Exposure and Stable Carbon Isotope Fingerprinting of Essential Amino Acids
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dried blood spots (DBS), created by applying and drying a whole blood sample onto filter paper, provide a simple and minimally invasive procedure for collecting, transporting, and storing blood. Because DBS are ideal for use in field and resource-limited settings, we aimed to develop a simple and accurate DBS-based approach for assessing mercury (Hg) exposure and dietary carbon sources for landlocked Arctic char, a sentinel fish species in the Arctic. We collected liquid whole blood (from the caudal vein), muscle, liver, and brains of Arctic char (n = 36) from 8 lakes spanning a Hg gradient in the Canadian High Arctic. We measured total Hg concentrations ([THg]) of field-prepared DBS and Arctic char tissues. Across a considerable range, [THg] of DBS (0.04-3.38 mu g/g wet wt) were highly correlated with [THg] of all tissues (r(2) range = 0.928-0.996). We also analyzed the compound-specific carbon isotope ratios (expressed as delta C-13 values) of essential amino acids (EAAs) isolated from DBS, liquid whole blood, and muscle. The delta C-13 values of 5 EAAs (delta C-13(EAAs); isoleucine [Ile], leucine [Leu], phenylalanine [Phe], valine [Val], and threonine [Thr]) from DBS were highly correlated with delta C-13(EAAs) of liquid whole blood (r(2) range = 0.693-0.895) and muscle (r(2) range = 0.642-0.881). The patterns of delta C-13(EAAs) of landlocked Arctic char were remarkably consistent across sample types and indicate that EAAs are most likely of algal origin. Because a small volume of blood (similar to 50 mu L) dried on filter paper can be used to determine Hg exposure levels of various tissues and to fingerprint carbon sources, DBS sampling may decrease the burdens of research and may be developed as a nonlethal sampling technique.

AB  - Background In allergic rhinitis, a relevant outcome providing information on the effectiveness of interventions is needed. In MASK-air (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network), a visual analogue scale (VAS) for work is used as a relevant outcome. This study aimed to assess the performance of the work VAS work by comparing VAS work with other VAS measurements and symptom-medication scores obtained concurrently.Methods All consecutive MASK-air users in 23 countries from 1 June 2016 to 31 October 2018 were included (14 189 users; 205 904 days). Geolocalized users self-assessed daily symptom control using the touchscreen functionality on their smart phone to click on VAS scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for overall symptoms (global), nose, eyes, asthma and work. Two symptom-medication scores were used: the modified EAACI CSMS score and the MASK control score for rhinitis. To assess data quality, the intra-individual response variability (IRV) index was calculated.Results A strong correlation was observed between VAS work and other VAS. The highest levels for correlation with VAS work and variance explained in VAS work were found with VAS global, followed by VAS nose, eye and asthma. In comparison with VAS global, the mCSMS and MASK control score showed a lower correlation with VAS work. Results are unlikely to be explained by a low quality of data arising from repeated VAS measures.Conclusions VAS work correlates with other outcomes (VAS global, nose, eye and asthma) but less well with a symptom-medication score. VAS work should be considered as a potentially useful AR outcome in intervention studies.

TI  - The contribution of semi-natural habitats to biological control is dependent on sentinel prey type
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely recognized that landscape factors affect the biological control of weed seeds and insect pests in arable crops, but landscape effects have been found to be inconsistent between studies.Here, we compare six different types of sentinels (surrogate prey that was either live insects or seeds) to measure the effects of semi-natural habitats at field to landscape scales on levels of biological control in winter wheat in the UK. Sentinels were located in fields adjacent to three boundary types: grassy margin, hedgerows or woodland to study the local scale effects and in landscapes of varying heterogeneity in study areas of 1-km radius.Overall, mean levels of predation were higher for most insect prey (60.8%) located on the ground compared to the crop (12.2%) and was lower for seeds (5.8%). Predation of sentinels on the ground was attributed to generalist predators. Semi-natural habitats had both positive and negative effects at field and landscape scales, but the response varied with the sentinel type. Herbaceous linear semi-natural habitats had positive effects at local scales for Calliphora vomitoria and Sitobion avenae sentinels and provide evidence that farmers can introduce linear herbaceous features to benefit biological control. In contrast, our distance-weighted kernel models identified a positive relationship between woody habitats and the predation of C. vomitoria and Chenopodium album. Natural aphid infestations were lower in landscapes with more semi-natural habitat.Synthesis and applications. Sentinels may be sensitive enough to detect variation in levels of biological control influenced by semi-natural habitats, but this study confirms that landscape effects differ for different types of sentinel prey. This implies that it may not be possible to categorize landscapes as pest suppressive using a single sentinel type. Future studies should therefore consider using multiple sentinels to give a better perspective on predation intensity. The resulting recommendations for farm management include planting woodland adjacent wheat fields infested with seed predators and positioning herbaceous linear habitats adjacent wheat fields infested with Sitobion avenae, particularly if fields are bordered by woody liner habitats due to their association with decreased S. avenae predation.

TI  - Vicarious Learning From Innovative Women Entrepreneurs in Thailand
T2  - ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ProblemThe number of Thai women entrepreneurs has increased to nearly half of all Thai entrepreneurs over the past years with 80% of them reported to have entered into opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. This growing social phenomenon, however, remains underexplored by limited numbers of academic studies on Thai women entrepreneurship. Extending the understanding of opportunity-driven women entrepreneurs in the changing Thai context is therefore significant for developing national human resources.The SolutionThis study highlights the opportunity-driven category of women entrepreneurs defined by Cromie and Hayes as Innovators. Taking the phenomenological approach as a research method, in-depth interviews from 13 innovative women business owners in Thailand were analyzed to understand their motivations, challenges, and success factors, as well as the contemporary worldview of the Thai culture and values concerning gender roles and social norms.The StakeholdersNational policymakers, educators, human resource development professionals, and parents can craft policies and practices that align with key learnings from the lived experiences of women entrepreneurs. Aspiring women entrepreneurs can also vicariously learn from the study participants who serve as role models.

TI  - A New Index to Better Detect and Monitor Agricultural Drought in Niger Using Multisensor Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a new remote sensing-based drought index, the agricultural drought condition index (ADCI), for agricultural drought monitoring in the agricultural area of Niger. It is defined as a first principal component analysis (PCA) of precipitation condition index (PCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), and evapotranspiration condition index (ETCI). ADCI integrates multisource remote sensing data from Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and it synthesizes precipitation deficits, vegetation growth status, soil thermal stress, and crop water stress in the drought process. A series of validation tests have been implemented using a one-month standardized precipitation index (SPI-1), the crop yield and the vegetation health index (VHI) during the crop growth period (June-October) from 2003 to 2017. The results show that ADCI is not only strongly correlated with SPI-1, but also with the variation of crop yield and the VHI. When tested against VHI, the ADCI performed better than VHI. Thus, it was proven that this index is a full drought monitoring indicator and it can not only contain the meteorological drought information, but also reflect drought influence on agriculture.

TI  - The Impact of Violations of Bicycles and Pedestrians on Vehicle Emissions at Signalized Intersections
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An intersection is a typical emission hot spot in the urban traffic network. And frequent violations such as running the red light have been a critical social problem at signalized intersections in developing countries. This article aimed to quantify the impact of violations (behaviors which will block the fleet) on emissions at signalized intersections. Increased emissions of vehicles affected by violations are of two levels: (1) trajectory level for the first four affected vehicles and (2) traffic flow level for the subsequent vehicles. At the trajectory level, the study focuses on the second-by-second activities of the first four affected vehicles. First, the trajectory model of the first affected vehicle is developed. Then, the trajectory of the other three vehicles is constructed using the Gipps car-following model. At the traffic flow level, a linear emission model is developed to describe the relationship between emission factors and idling time in the one-stop (vehicle stop once) and two-stop (vehicle stop twice) scenarios based on the global position system (GPS)-collected data at 44 intersections in Beijing. Based on the linear emission model, increased emissions at the traffic flow level are calculated as knowing the number of stops and idling time before and after violations. The analysis of the subsequent vehicles is divided into unsaturated and saturated conditions. Under the unsaturated condition, the emissions have barely increased due to the increase of idling time for one-stop vehicles caused by the violations. Under the saturated conditions, the emission increment increases sharply as the one-stop vehicle gradually transforms to a two-stop vehicle because of violations, and the maximum emission increment reaches 45% in half an hour in the case. The increment of emissions decreases steadily as the proportion of two-stop vehicles reaches 100% after violations, while the proportion before violations keeps increasing.

TI  - Features of cotton wool spots in diabetic retinopathy: a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography angiography study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To describe the features of cotton wool spots (CWSs) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) by using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT angiography). Methods We retrospectively studied patients with DR who presented CWSs and had been imaged by SD-OCT angiography. The retinal layer localisation and dimensions of the CWSs were assessed on SD-OCT, while the decorrelation signal generated by the CWSs and the vascular density (VD) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus around the CWSs and in the macula were assessed on OCT angiography. Results A total of 87 eyes of 57 DR patients were included. All CWSs were located in the retinal nerve fibre layer and exhibited a decorrelation signal on OCT angiography. In 68 eyes (78.1%), hyporeflective cavities appearing as cysts in the CWS were noted, especially when were peripheral and large (P < 0.0001). The thickness averaged 211.8 +/- 80.02 mm and was positively influenced by recent diabetes history, glycaemic dysregulation, posterior pole localisation and a high VD of the SCP around the CWS, while the surface area averaged 0.33 +/- 0.24 mm(2) and was influenced only by a low VD of the SCP around the CWS (P < 0.001). In 72 eyes (82.7%), the non-perfused areas were predominant in the periphery of the CWS. Conclusion The features of CWSs are influenced by systemic factors, such as history and severity of diabetes, in association with local factors, such as localisation and retinal ischaemia. The peripheral localisation of ischaemia confirms the hypothesis that CWSs are sentinel lesions.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS techniques to monitor morphological changes along the middle-lower Vistula river, Poland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the combined use of Remote Sensing data and Geography Information System (GIS) tools is becoming mainstream in evaluating the river channel evolution at many spatiotemporal scales, thanks to the low costs of such techniques and the increased availability of high-resolute satellite images. These methods can be applied to investigate large ungauged basins and accounting for relatively long periods, becoming a precious support tool for water management strategies at the reach scale. The medium-term planform changes of an 80-km reach of the Vistula River downstream of Warsaw, Poland, were evaluated considering the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) of four Landsat images acquired in 1985, 1994, 2004 and 2017, which referred to similar hydrological conditions. The study highlighted that, by combining satellite information with semi-automatic digital processing procedures developed in GIS, it is possible to see that the reach resulted quite stable in the whole period under a morphological point of view, even if a reduced depositional trend along the banks is visible, especially in the last decade, probably because of a slight increment in the frequency of high water events. The results of this research can be helpful in better designing the future management strategies of this middle-lower reach, also in the light of the inland navigation projects started among Europe and affecting the Vistula River.

TI  - Cooling effects of different wetlands in semi-arid rural region of Northeast China
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems play an important role in regulating local and regional climates through evaporative cooling effects that affect the exchange of energy and water with atmosphere. A lot of researches had been focused on the wetland cooling effect, especially in mitigating urban heat island effect. However, the intensity and influencing factors of wetland cooling effect currently cannot be thorough explained. In this study, we assessed the cooling effect of wetlands with different types in rural area of Northeast China by using split-window algorithm (SWA) to estimate land surface temperatures (LST) from Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor. We used correlation analysis to examine the relationships between characteristics of wetlands and cooling effect. Our results showed that paddy fields had the largest cooling effects than lakes followed by marshes for human disturbance. Size and shaped complexity were important characteristics to determine wetland cooling effects. Although our results suggested that larger size of wetlands might have higher intensity and spatial extent of cooling effects, small size of wetlands might have large or almost similar amount of cooling effects with the larger ones. Our findings have important implications for land managers and policy makers to design effective plans for conservation and climate change adaptation.

TI  - The Impact of Type 1 Interferons on Alveolar Macrophage Tolerance and Implications for Host Susceptibility to Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - That macrophages adapt to environmental cues is well-established. This adaptation has had several reiterations, first with innate imprinting and then with various combinations of trained, tolerant, paralyzed, or primed. Whatever the nomenclature, it represents a macrophage that is required to perform very different functions. First, alveolar macrophages are one of the sentinel cells that flag up damage and release mediators that attract other immune cells. Next, they mature to support T cell priming and survival. Finally they are critical in clearing inflammatory immune cells by phagocytosis and extracellular matrix turnover components by efferocytosis. At each functional stage they alter intrinsic components to guide their activity. Training therefore is akin to changing function. In this mini-review we focus on the lung and the specific role of type I interferons in altering macrophage activity. The proposed mechanisms of type I IFNs on lung-resident alveolar macrophages and their effect on host susceptibility to bacterial infection following influenza virus infection.

TI  - Acral lentiginous melanoma: a single-centre retrospective review of four decades in East-Central Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) occurs on the palms, soles and subungual surface and has poor prognosis. It is uncommon in the Caucasian population and has remained unreported in East-Central Europe.Objectives Our aim was to collect data from East-Central Europe by analysing the demographic and clinicopathologic features of patients with ALM and comparing data with the reports in literature.Methods We conducted a single-centre, retrospective review between 1976 and 2016 at one of the largest melanoma referral centres in Hungary.Results We identified 176 patients with ALM (3.83%) from 4593 patients with melanoma (mean age: 66.2 years). The tumours were mainly located on the lower extremities (88.63%). The mean Breslow tumour thickness was 3.861 mm, 37.50% of the tumours were thicker than 4.00 mm, and 71.6% exhibited microscopic ulceration. Nearly one-third of the patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, and 60.3% of the biopsies were positive for metastasis. The positive SLN status was associated with significantly thick tumours and reduced survival. Patients with ALM had 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 60.5% and 41.6%, respectively. The mean delay in diagnosis was 18 months after the discovery of skin tumours. In multivariate analyses, age, tumour thickness and distant metastasis were independent risk factors for poor survival (P < 0.001).Conclusions Our study, which is the first single-centre report in East-Central Europe focusing on ALM, confirms that patient and tumour characteristics and prognostic factors are similar with previous literature data involving Caucasians; however, tumour thickness and survival suggest even worse prognosis.

TI  - Rat volatiles as an attractant source for the Asian tiger mosquito, <i>Aedes</i> <i>albopictus</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a vector of dengue, chikungunya, and dirofilariasis. Volatile compounds are crucial for mosquitoes to locate their hosts. This knowledge has allowed the identification of attractants derived from human odours for highly anthropophilic mosquito species. In this study, we used rats as a experimental model to identify potential attractants for host-seeking Ae. albopictus females. Porapak Q extracts from immature female rats were more attractive to Ae. albopictus females than those from mature and pregnant females, and males. Phenol, 4-methylphenol, 4-ethylphenol, and indole were identified compounds in male, immature, mature, and pregnant female extracts. There were quantitative differences in these compounds among the extracts that likely explain the discrepancy in their attractiveness. Ae. albopictus females were not attracted to the single compounds when was compared with the four-component blend. However, the binary blend of 4-methylphenol + 4-ethylphenol and the tertiary blend of 4-methylphenol + 4-ethylphenol + indole were as attractive as the four-component blend. In the field trials, BGS traps baited with the tertiary or quaternary blends caught more Ae. albopictus females and males than BGS traps without lures. This is the first laboratory and field study to identify compounds that mediate the attraction of Ae. albopictus to one of its hosts.

TI  - A framework to assess the impact of ecological water conveyance on groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems in arid inland river basins
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Overexploitation of water resources at middle reaches has threatened downstream oasis in arid inland river basins. To achieve sustainable development, ecological water conveyance is one effective measure to reallocate water resources between socio-economic and natural systems. A comprehensive impact assessment of ecological water conveyance on groundwater-dependent ecosystems that are common in downstream inland river basins is needed. The present study integrated the technologies of remote sensing analysis, trend detection, and numerical simulation into a technical framework that identifies the spatial response and temporal dynamics of vegetation to groundwater changes induced by ecological water conveyance. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as a proxy to estimate vegetation. The structure of the framework we used is clear and reasonable. We used remote-sensing data and ground truth information, and a decision tree that incorporates an iterative self-organizing data analysis technique. The decision tree classifies the land cover into affected and unaffected areas, and the results indicate the spatial range of impact. The Mann-Kendall algorithm and Sen's slope detect the tendency in NDVI series that indicates the temporal response of vegetation. The Verhulst logistic function, combined with environment carrying capacity function, constitutes a simplified vegetation dynamic model that can be used to predict potential impact through scenario analysis. An application in the Shiyang River basin in Northwest China evaluated the performance and usefulness of the framework; the accuracy of the results suggested that the framework is effective and practical. Additional case studies are required to assess the reliability and applicability of the framework and identify the factors that affect assessment results beyond our case study in the Shiyang River basin.

TI  - BESS-STAIR: a framework to estimate daily, 30 m, and all-weather crop evapotranspiration using multi-source satellite data for the US Corn Belt
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing crop water demands and drought threats, mapping and monitoring of cropland evapotranspiration (ET) at high spatial and temporal resolutions become increasingly critical for water management and sustainability. However, estimating ET from satellites for precise water resource management is still challenging due to the limitations in both existing ET models and satellite input data. Specifically, the process of ET is complex and difficult to model, and existing satellite remote-sensing data could not fulfill high resolutions in both space and time. To address the above two issues, this study presents a new high spatiotemporal resolution ET mapping framework, i.e., BESS-STAIR, which integrates a satellite-driven water-carbon-energy coupled biophysical model, BESS (Breathing Earth System Simulator), with a generic and fully automated fusion algorithm, STAIR (SaTallite dAta IntegRation). In this framework, STAIR provides daily 30 m multispectral surface reflectance by fusing Landsat and MODIS satellite data to derive a fine-resolution leaf area index and visible/near-infrared albedo, all of which, along with coarse-resolution meteorological and CO2 data, are used to drive BESS to estimate gap-free 30 m resolution daily ET. We applied BESS-STAIR from 2000 through 2017 in six areas across the US Corn Belt and validated BESSSTAIR ET estimations using flux-tower measurements over 12 sites (85 site years). Results showed that BESS-STAIR daily ET achieved an overall R-2 = 0.75, with root mean square error RMSE = 0.93 mm (d(-1) and relative error RE = 27.9 % when benchmarked with the flux measurements. In addition, BESS-STAIR ET estimations captured the spatial patterns, seasonal cycles, and interannual dynamics well in different sub-regions. The high performance of the BESSSTAIR framework primarily resulted from (1) the implementation of coupled constraints on water, carbon, and energy in BESS, (2) high-quality daily 30 m data from the STAIR fusion algorithm, and (3) BESS's applicability under all-sky conditions. BESS-STAIR is calibration-free and has great potentials to be a reliable tool for water resource management and precision agriculture applications for the US Corn Belt and even worldwide given the global coverage of its input data.

TI  - Persistent Organic Pollutants and Mercury in Genetically Identified Inner Estuary Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) Residents of the Guayaquil Gulf, Ecuador: Ecotoxicological Science in Support of Pollutant Management and Cetacean Conservation.
T2  - Frontiers in Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common cetaceans found in the coastal waters, estuaries, and mangroves of Ecuador. However, its population size is gradually declining in the Gulf of Guayaquil, and anthropogenic factors including habitat degradation, uncontrolled dolphin watching, dredging activities, increasing maritime traffic, underwater noise, bycatch, and marine pollution have been implicated in their decline. Very little is known about contamination by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from the Pacific coast of South America. To address this research gap, the first assessment of total mercury (THg) and POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in mangroves (El Morro Mangrove Wildlife Refuge) of the Gulf of Guayaquil, was conducted in Ecuador in 2018. Dolphin samples (i.e., skin and blubber; n = 9), were obtained using dart biopsy field methods for contaminant analysis. POP concentrations ranged from 0.56 to 13.0 mg/kg in lipid weight, while THg ranged from 1.92 to 3.63 mg/kg in dry weight. The predominant POPs were OCPs (50% of [SIGMA]POP), followed by PCBs (46%) and PBDEs (6.0%); particularly, [rho],[rho]'-DDE, the main DDT metabolite and a potent antiandrogenic, accounting for 42% of [SIGMA]POP, ranging from 0.12 to [approximately]7.0 mg/kg lw, followed by PCB 153 (8.0%) and PCB 180 (5.0%). PBDE 47 accounted for 2.0% of [SIGMA]POP. While the POP concentrations are lower than those found in dolphins from many other regions of the world, some of the THg concentrations are within the concentration range found in dolphins from the southeastern coast of the United States. The ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that some of the sampled dolphins are exposed to immunotoxic and endocrine disruption effects by POPs and mercury. The low genetic diversity of this distinctive dolphin population, likely exhibiting genetic isolation and a unique evolutionary heritage, could be lost if the population continues to decline in the face of anthropogenic threats, including chemical pollution. Our finding shows that bottlenose dolphins in coastal Ecuador are exposed to environmental contaminants and can be used as sentinel species for ecosystem health to monitor pollution in the region and to support ecotoxicological risk assessment and regional pollutant management.

TI  - The contribution of religious education and ethics to the development of worldviews: reflections of Finnish 9th grade students
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to discuss the role of religious education and ethics instruction in the development of worldviews in public education using empirical data. The research question of the article is: How is the contribution of RE and Ethics in the development of worldviews perceived among 9th grade students? The study is based on qualitative interview data (N = 37) gathered from Finnish 9th grade students of different religious and worldview backgrounds. The article will also describe three cases from that sample: from Islamic RE, Lutheran RE and Ethics instruction. The data was analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The results indicate that students' perceptions on the contribution of RE or ethics to the development of their worldviews could be divided into two groups: RE or Ethics were seen as contributors to students' already existing worldviews or considered insignificant in relation to the development of their worldviews. Whether the instruction was considered strengthening or irrelevant in the development of a worldview did not depend on the background of the student. Aspects related to experiences about the instruction were intertwined with the questions referring to the contribution of instruction in the formation of worldviews.

TI  - Linkages between land cover change, lake shrinkage, and sublacustrine influence determined from remote sensing of select Rift Valley Lakes in Kenya
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Rift Valley systemis hometo many volcanic and tectonic lakes including some of the world's oldest and deepest lakes. These lakes host a rich heritage of biodiversity that is endangered by recent drastic hydrologic changes due to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors in the catchment areas of some of the lakes. This study utilized Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI data to conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between hydrological dynamics in the basins of four Rift Valley lakes (Nakuru, Baringo, Bogoria, and Elementaita) and recent land cover and land-use change. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) proved to be more accurate and robust for delineatingwater surface areaswhen compared to the output of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and classification algorithms. NDVI was successful when delineatingwater surface at Lake Baringo but not in Lakes Bogoria, Nakuru, and Elementaita, whose surfaces were dominated by algae. All the lakes expanded substantially after 2010 submerging surrounding areas leading to disruption of livelihoods, property damage, and displacement of thousands of people. The recent drastic hydrologic changes have multiple causations including land cover and land use change, increase in rainfall, and possible change in geogenic water input due to tectonic activity. The rapid rise inwater levels appears to have altered the biogeochemical balance of the hypersaline lakes with severe ramifications on the rich biodiversity that is supported by the lakes.

TI  - Estimating exposure to hydrogen sulfide from animal husbandry operations using satellite ammonia as a proxy: Methodology demonstration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Husbandry trace gases that have climate change implications such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3) can be quantified through remote sensing; however, many husbandry gases with health implications such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), cannot. This pilot study demonstrates an approach to derive H2S concentrations by coupling in situ and remote sensing data.Using AMOG (AutoMObile trace Gas) Surveyor, a mobile air quality and meteorology laboratory, we measured in situ concentrations of CH4, CO2, NH3, H2S, and wind at a southern California university research dairy. Emissions were 0.13, 1.93, 0.022 and 0.0064 Gg yr(-1); emission factors (E-F) were 422, 6333, 74, and 21 kg cow(-1) yr(-1), respectively, for the 306 head herd. Contributing to these strong EF were spillway emissions from a grate between the main cowshed and the waste lagoon identified in airborne remote sensing data acquired by the hyperspectral thermal infrared imager, Mako.NH3 emissions from the Chino Dairy Complex, also in southern California, were calculated from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite data for 2008-2017 using average morning winds, yielding a flushing time of 2.7 h, and 8.9 Gg yr(-1). The ratio of EF(H2S) to EF(NH3) for the research dairy from AMOG data were applied to IASI NH3 emissions to derive H2S exposure concentration maps for the Chino area, which ranged to 10-30 ppb H2S for many populated areas.Combining remote sensing with in situ concentrations of multiple emitted gases can allow derivation of emissions at the sub-facility, facility, and larger scales, providing spatial and temporal coverage that can translate into exposure estimates for use in epidemiology studies and regulation development. Furthermore, with high fidelity information at the sub-facility level we can identify best practices and opportunities to sustainably and holistically reduce husbandry emissions.

TI  - Severe Californian wildfires in November 2018 observed from space: the carbon monoxide perspective
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to proceeding climate change, some regions such as California face rising weather extremes with dry periods becoming warmer and drier, entailing the risk that wildfires and associated air pollution episodes will continue to increase. November 2018 turned into one of the most severe wildfire episodes on record in California, with two particularly destructive wildfires spreading concurrently through the north and the south of the state. Both fires ignited at the wildland-urban interface, causing many civilian fatalities and forcing the total evacuation of several cities and communities.Here we demonstrate that the inherent carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the wildfires and subsequent transport can be observed from space by analysing radiance measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite in the shortwave infrared spectral range. From the determined CO distribution we assess the corresponding air quality burden in major Californian cities caused by the fires and discuss the associated uncertainties. As a result of the prevailing wind conditions, the largest CO load during the first days of the fires is found in Sacramento and San Francisco, with city area averages reaching boundary layer concentration anomalies of about 2.5 mg CO m(-3). Even the most polluted city scenes likely comply with the national ambient air quality standards (10 mg CO m(-3) with 8 h averaging time). This finding based on dense daily recurrent satellite monitoring is consistent with isolated ground-based air quality measurements.

TI  - Quantifying the Mitigating Effects of Whole-Breast Radiotherapy and Systemic Treatments on Regional Recurrence Incidence Among Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite the potential for residual lymph node metastases after a negative or positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), breast cancer patients rarely experience regional recurrences (RRs). This study aimed to quantify the effects of nonsurgical treatments on RR incidence among SLNB-negative (SLNB N0) breast cancer patients. Methods All primary SLNB N0-staged breast cancer patients with a diagnosis between 2005 and 2008 and 5-year follow-up data on recurrences were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The cumulative incidence function (CIF) for RR was calculated as the first event at 5 years, taking into account any other first-event (local or distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or death) as competing risk. Cox regression analysis was used to model the cause-specific hazard of RR developing as the first event to quantify the effect of adjuvant systemic therapy and whole-breast radiotherapy (RT) on RR incidence at 5 years. Results The study included 13,512 patients. Of these patients, 162 experienced an RR. The CIF of RR at 5 years was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.5%), whereas the CIFs for death and other events were 4.4% and 9.5%, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.46 (95% CI 0.33-0.64), 0.31 (95% CI 0.18-0.55), and 0.40 (95% CI 0.24-0.67) respectively for patients treated by RT as a routine part of breast-conserving therapy (BCT), chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Conclusion RT as routine part of BCT, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy independently exerted a mitigating effect on the risk for the development of RR. The three methods at least halved the risk.

TI  - Linking green infrastructure to urban heat and human health risk mitigation in Oslo, Norway
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The predicted extreme temperatures of globalwarming aremagnified in cities due to the urban heat island effect. Even if the target for average temperature increase in the Paris Climate Agreement is met, temperatures during the hottest month in a northern city like Oslo are predicted to rise by over 5 degrees C by 2050. We hypothesised that heat-related diagnoses for heat-sensitive citizens (75+) in Oslo are correlated to monthly air temperatures, and that green infrastructure such as tree canopy cover reduces extreme land surface temperatures and thus reduces health risk from heat exposure. Monthly air temperatures were significantly correlated to the number of skin-related diagnoses at the city level, but were unrelated to diagnoses under circulatory, nervous system, or general categories. Satellite-derived spatially-explicit measures revealed that on one of the hottest days during the summer of 2018, landscape units composed of paved, midrise or lowrise buildings gave off the most heat (39 degrees C), whereas units composed of complete tree canopy cover, ormixed (i.e. tree and grass) vegetation maintained temperatures of between 29 and 32 degrees C. Land surface temperatureswere negatively correlated to tree canopy cover (R-2= 0.45) and vegetation greenness (R-2= 0.41). In a scenario inwhich each city tree was replaced by the most common non-tree cover in its neighbourhood, the area of Oslo exceeding a 30 degrees C health risk threshold during the summerwould increase from 23 to 29%. Combining modelling results with population at risk at census tract level, we estimated that each tree in the city currently mitigates additional heat exposure of one heatsensitive person by one day. Our results indicate that maintaining and restoring tree cover provides an ecosystem service of urban heat reduction. Our findings have particular relevance for health benefit estimation in urban ecosystem accounting and municipal policy decisions regarding ecosystem-based climate adaptation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Variability of sea ice area in the Bohai Sea from 1958 to 2015
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the backdrop of continuous global change, it is beneficial to create consistent long-term records of sea ice area on regional scales for ice disaster prevention and risk mitigation. In this study, a piecewise multiple nonlinear regression model was developed to reconstruct long-term daily sea ice area dataset in the Bohai Sea from 1958 to 2015 by linking the related meteorological data and the satellite-derived ice area. The validation analysis show that related meteorological status corresponding to physical process had stable skill of predictive ability, which was able to account for 81% of the observational variance under consideration of sea ice state, freezing and melting phases. The reconstructed daily sea ice area dataset was further used to study the interannual and seasonal variability of sea ice area. The annual maximum ice area (AMIA) and the annual average ice area (AAIA) in the Bohai Sea exhibited a decreasing trend with fluctuation of -0.33 +/- 0.18% yr(-1) and -0.51 +/- 0.16% yr(-1) over the period of 1958-2015, respectively. The most obvious change of the Bohai Sea ice area occurred in time scale of similar to 30 years. The whole study period could be divided into slight increasing stage (1958-1980), significant decreasing stage (1980-1995), and moderate increasing stage (1995-2015). In most years, the annual changes of sea ice area showed an unimodal variation and the freezing period (similar to 65 days) was longer than the melting phase (similar to 40 days) due to the relatively higher freezing rate. In addition, high correlations between AAIA and Arctic Oscillation (AO) index (r=-0.60, p <.01) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (r=-0.69, p < .01) from 1958 to 2015 suggested AO and NAO are the primary large-scale climate factors driving the sea ice variability in the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Using HJ-CC D image and PLS algorithm to estimate the yield of field-grown winter wheat
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been used as an important means of estimating crop production, especially for the estimation of crop yield in the middle and late growth period. In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating winter wheat yield through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between satellite remote sensing variables obtained from HJ-CCD images and the winter wheat yield, and used the partial least square (PLS) algorithm to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing models of estimating the yield. The research showed a close relationship between yield and most remote sensing variables. Significant multiple correlations were also recorded between most remote sensing variables. The optimal principal components numbers of PLS models used to estimate yield were 4. Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were sensitive variables for yield remote sensing estimation. Through model development and model validation evaluation, the yield estimation model's coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.81 and 0.74 respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) were 693.9 kg ha(-1) and 786.5 kg ha(-1). It showed that the PLS algorithm model estimates the yield better than the linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The estimation accuracy was improved by more than 20% than the LR algorithm, and was 13% higher than the PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield by remote sensing, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion.

TI  - Ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in children under six years of age
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from aberrant ion transport due to abnormalities or absence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride transporter that resides on the apical surface of epithelial cells. A novel class of medications, known as CFTR modulators, specifically target the abnormal protein. Areas covered: Ivacaftor increases the open probability of CFTR located on the cell surface, leading to enhanced chloride transport, and has been shown to improve lung function, weight, and quality of life. We reviewed the sentinel studies that lead to the approval of the use of ivacaftor in people with CF age six months and older with at least one CFTR gene mutation that is responsive to ivacaftor based on clinical trial and/or in vitro data. Children with CF have the greatest potential to benefit from CFTR modulator therapy when it is initiated prior to the development of permanent damage; however, challenges remain regarding use of ivacaftor in the youngest pediatric population. Expert opinion: Ivacaftor is safe and effective CFTR modulator that can be prescribed in children over six months of age with at least one CFTR gene mutation that is responsive to ivacaftor.

TI  - Water Use Monitoring for Irrigation in the United States: A Case Study in Alabama and Lessons Learned for Achieving Sustainability
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of water use is an important step in managing water resources in an efficient, sustainable manner. Irrigation is especially important as the largest consumptive use of freshwater in the United States. The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) monitor water use for irrigation at the national level, but many states have their own programs. Alabama collects data for irrigation, but there are concerns about participation and accuracy. We investigated the effectiveness of the program in southeastern Alabama for 2011 to 2015, with a focus on center pivot irrigation. The number of pivots increased by about 50 percent (461 to 712), but the number of pumps registered with the state remained the same (126), and water use reporting was consistently low at 50 percent. An attempt to match registered pumps with center pivots for calculating depth of irrigation applied to fields was obstructed by inaccurate pump location data provided on application forms and other issues. Recommended changes to the program include adopting North American Industry Classification System codes for identifying types of water use, adopting the USDA's classification system for methods of irrigation, revising instructions about mapping pump and center pivot locations, and conducting workshops to inform farmers about updates and to encourage participation.

TI  - Effects of spatial-temporal land cover distribution on gross primary production and net primary production in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Annual total Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP) and the annual total stored GPP and NPP are tightly coupled to land cover distributions because the distinct vegetation conditions of different land cover classes strongly affect GPP and NPP. Spatial and statistical analysis tools using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to investigate the spatial distribution of each land cover class and the GPP and NPP based on the CORINE land cover classification in the federal state, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany for the years 2000, 2006 and 2012. Results "Non-irrigated arable land" and "pastures" were the dominant land cover classes. Because of their large area, "non-irrigated arable land" and "pastures" had higher annual total stored GPP and NPP values than the other land cover classes. Annual total GPP and NPP hotspots were concentrated in the central-western part of Schleswig-Holstein. Cold spots were mainly located in the western and eastern Schleswig-Holstein. The distributions of the annual total GPP and NPP hotspots and cold spots were primarily determined by land cover and land cover changes among the investigated years. The average annual total NPP/GPP ratios were 0.5647, 0.5350 and 0.5573 in the years 2000, 2006 and 2012, respectively. The calculated respiration in 2006 was the highest, followed by those in 2012 and 2000. Conclusions The land cover classes with high-ability of carbon stocks in 2000, 2006 and 2012 in Schleswig-Holstein were identified in this study. Furthermore, it is recommendable to enhance the annual total GPP and NPP and the annual total stored GPP and NPP in Schleswig-Holstein by replacing the land cover classes showing low carbon stock capabilities with the classes showing high abilities for the purpose of increasing greenhouse gas fixation.

TI  - Reduced <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection in a pragmatic stepped-wedge initiative using admission surveillance to detect colonization
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundClostridioides difficile Infection (CDI) is a persistent healthcare issue. In the US, CDI is the most common infectious cause of hospital-onset (HO) diarrhea.ObjectiveAssess the impact of admission testing for toxigenic C. difficile colonization on the incidence of HO-CDI.DesignPragmatic stepped-wedge Infection Control initiative.SettingNorthShore University HealthSystem is a four-hospital system near Chicago, IL.PatientsAll patients admitted to the four hospitals during the initiative.InterventionsFrom September 2017 through August 2018 we conducted a quality improvement program where admitted patients had a peri-rectal swab tested for toxigenic C. difficile. All colonized patients were placed into contact precautions.MeasurementsWe tested admissions who: i) had been hospitalized within two months, ii) had a past C. difficile positive test, and/or iii) were in a long-term care facility within six months. We measured compliance with all other practices to reduce the incidence of HO-CDI.Results30% of admissions were tested and 8.3% were positive. In the year prior to the initiative (Period 1) there were 63,057 admitted patients when HO-CDI incidence was 5.96 cases/10,000 patient days. During the 12-month initiative (Period 2) there were 62,760 admissions and the HO-CDI incidence was 4.23 cases/10,000 patient days (p = 0.02). There were no other practice or antibiotic use changes. Continuing admission surveillance provided a HOCDI incidence of 2.9 cases/10,000 patient days during the final 9 months of 2018 (p<0.0001 compared to Period 1), equaling < 1 case/1,000 admissions.LimitationsThis was not a randomized controlled trial, and multiple prevention practices were in place at the time of the admission surveillance initiative.ConclusionAdmission C. difficile surveillance testing is an important tool for preventing hospital-onset C. difficile infection.RegistrationThis quality improvement initiative is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The unique registration identifier number is NCT04014608.

TI  - Changes in climate patterns and their association to natural hazard distribution in South Tyrol (Eastern Italian Alps)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Alpine regions changes in seasonal climatic parameters, such as temperature, rainfall, and snow amount have already been observed. Specifically, in the South Tyrol area, meteorological observations indicate that temperatures are increasing and the number of snow days has generally diminished over time with perennial snow line now observed at higher elevations. Changes in rainfall have also been observed with more events associated with higher temperatures in the summer season. Natural hazards - mainly debris and mud flows, landslides, avalanches, rock falls, and (flash) floods - that affect this area every year, damaging population and infrastructures, are either weather or cryosphere-related. While these events have been recorded sporadically since the beginning of the 20th century, a systematic approach of their inventory has been done by local authorities since the 1990s. So far, Earth observation data has not been exploited to complete or complement existing inventories nor have they been used to investigate the influence of climate perturbation on potentially dangerous natural phenomena. The research presented here thus has three objectives: (i) analyse long time series of climate data and hazard occurrence in South Tyrol to examine if these records exhibit a coherent response of hazards to changes in climate; (ii) measure the spatio-temporal evolution of climatic and natural hazard events recorded, and (iii) explore potential relations between meteorological conditions and the hazard occurrence. In this context, in-situ and satellite-based climate data are exploited to study natural hazard triggers while the potential of Earth observation data is evaluated as a complement to the existing historical records of natural hazards. Specifically, Copernicus Sentinel-1 images are used to detect the spatio-temporal distribution of slow earth surface deformations and the results used for checking the completeness of the actual slow-moving landslide inventories. Hazard-related changes in the South Tyrolian landscape have also been analysed in relation to particular meteorological events at a regional scale, assessing trends and anomalies. Results show that: (i) satellite data are very useful to complement the existing natural hazard inventories; (ii) in-situ and satellite-based climate records show similar patterns but differ due to regional versus local variability; (iii) even in a data-rich region such as the analysed area, the overall response of natural hazard occurrence, magnitude, and frequency to change in climate variables is difficult to decipher due to the presence of multiple triggers and locally driven ground responses. However, an increase in the average annual duration of rainfall events and debris flow occurrence can be observed.

TI  - Mapping Land Use Land Cover Change in the Lower Mekong Basin From 1997 to 2010
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is biologically diverse, economically important, and home to about 65 million people. The region has undergone extensive environmental changes since the 1990s due to such factors as agricultural expansion and intensification, deforestation, more river damming, increased urbanization, growing human populations, expansion of industrial forest plantations, plus frequent natural disasters from flooding and drought. The Mekong river is also heavily used for human transportation, fishing, drinking water, and irrigation. This paper discusses use of pre-existing LULC maps from 1997 and 2010 to derive a LMB regional LULC change map for 9 classes per date using GIS overlay techniques. The change map was derived to aid SWAT hydrologic modeling applications in the LMB, given the 2010 map is currently used in multiple LMB SWAT models, whereas the 1997 map was previously used. The 2010 LULC map was constructed from Landsat and MODIS satellite data, while the 1997 map was from before the MODIS era and therefore based on available Landsat data. The 1997-2010 LULC change map showed multiple trends. Permanent agriculture had expanded in certain sub-basins into previously forested areas. Some agricultural areas were converted to industrial forest plantations. Extensive forest changes also occurred in some locations, such as areas changed to shifting cultivation or permanent crops. Also, the 1997 map under classified some urban areas, whereas the 2010 LULC map showed improved identification of such areas. LULC map accuracy were assessed for 213 randomly sampled locations. The 1997 and 2010 LULC maps showed high overall agreements with reference data exceeding 87%. The LULC change map yielded a moderately high level of overall agreement (78%) that improved to similar to 83% once LULC classification scheme specificity was reduced (forests and agriculture were each mapped as singular classes). The change map regionally showed a 4% decrease in agriculture and a 4% increase in deciduous and evergreen forests combined, though deforestation hot spot areas also were evident. The project yielded LULC map data sets that are now available for aiding additional studies that assess LMB LULC change and the impacts such change may pose to water, agriculture, forestry, and disaster management efforts. More work is needed to map, quantify and assess LULC change since 2010 and to further update the 2010 LULC map currently used in the LMB SWAT models.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on severity of coronavirus disease (COVID19) (transmissibility, disease seriousness, impact) is crucial for preparation of healthcare sectors. We present a simple approach to assess disease seriousness, creating a reference cohort of pneumonia patients from sentinel hospitals. First comparisons exposed a higher rate of COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation. There were more case fatalities among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities than in the reference cohort. Hospitals should prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources.

TI  - Appraisal of kappa-based metrics and disagreement indices of accuracy assessment for parametric and nonparametric techniques used in LULC classification and change detection
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of rapid urbanization, monitoring urban expansion has gained importance to sustainably manage the land resources and minimize the impact on the environment. Monitoring urban growth using satellite data involves computing the state of land use-land cover and their change over time. A number of computing methods have been developed to process and interpret the satellite results for an urban environment. However, due to a large number of parametric and nonparametric algorithms used for land-use-land-cover classification, there is uncertainty regarding choosing the best algorithm to measure the urban processes. In this study, several parametric (maximum likelihood) and nonparametric (support vector machine, spectral angle mapper, artificial neural network and decision tree) algorithms were used. The study was aimed at finding out the best available classification technique for land-use-land-cover classification and change detection. Landsat 8, the latest in Landsat series, and Landsat 7 and 5 freely available satellite data were used. Due to the redundancy reported for the traditional kappa-based indices, we applied modern disagreement indices to assess the accuracy of the classification process. Artificial neural network for Landsat 8 image had the highest kappa coefficient, while spectral angle mapper had the highest overall agreement (97%) and least quantity allocation error (1%). Spectral Angle Mapper gave the highest accuracy, while maximum likelihood classification gave the least for allocation and spatial disagreement indices. We found that spectral angle mapper gave the best results for land-use-land-cover change analysis in terms of least omission and commission errors (2.5% each) and highest overall agreement, whereas artificial neural network performed better in land-use-land-cover classification studies.

TI  - An Indigenous American Conceptualization of Substance Abuse and Its Treatment
T2  - ALCOHOLISM TREATMENT QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alcohol misuse has persisted in Indian country for generations. These disparities persist despite recent advances in services that often promote some combination of western-oriented conceptualizations of treatment with traditional healing and cultural practices. The intractability of alcohol and drug problems in many Indigenous communities suggests that current expressions of treatment are not sufficient to address substance misuse in these communities and effectively prepare clients for the post-treatment experiences of recovery. The focus of this paper is to generate hypotheses about what may be missing from the treatment today to improve treatment outcomes for Indigenous clients, and then propose ways for how treatment may be transformed from its current mostly western-oriented perspective to foundationally align with an Indigenous American worldview concerning well-being and health. Advancing treatment for American Indians and Alaska Natives includes consideration for how to address the consequences of colonialism that persist in ways that systematically harm the well-being and health of clients, how to align treatment models with Indigenous beliefs concerning an interdependent communalistic existence, and how to transform treatment to a holistic healing model that addresses alcohol and other substance misuse in the context of relationships.

TI  - Monitoring rice growth status in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam using multitemporal Sentinel-1 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the world's most dominant staple foods, and hence rice farming plays a vital role in a nation's economy and food security. To examine the applicability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for large areas, we propose an approach to determine rice age, date of planting (dop), and date of harvest (doh) using a time series of Sentinel-1 C-band in the entire Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The effect of the incidence angle of Sentinel-1 data on the backscatter pattern of paddy fields was reduced using the incidence angle normalization approach with an empirical model developed in this study. The time series was processed further to reduce noise with fast Fourier transform and smoothing filter. To evaluate and improve the accuracy of SAR data processing results, the classification outcomes were verified with field survey data through statistical metrics. The findings indicate that the Sentinel-1 images are particularly appropriate for rice age monitoring with R-2 = 0.92 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 7.3 days (n = 241) in comparison to in situ data. The proposed algorithm for estimating dop and doh also shows promising results with R-2 = 0.92 and RMSE = 6.2 days (n = 153) and R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 5.7 days (n = 88), respectively. The results have indicated the ability of using Sentinel-1 data to extract growth parameters involving rice age, planting and harvest dates. Information about rice age corresponding to the growth stages of rice fields is important for agricultural management and support the procurement and management of agricultural markets, limiting the negative effects on food security. The results showed that multitemporal Sentinel-1 data can be used to monitor the status of rice growth. Such monitoring system can assist many countries, especially in Asia, for managing agricultural land to ensure productivity. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Crater detection from commercial satellite imagery to estimate unexploded ordnance in Cambodian agricultural land
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Unexploded ordnance (UXO) pose a significant threat to post-conflict communities, and current efforts to locate bombs rely on time-intensive and dangerous in-person enumeration. Very high resolution (VHR) sub-meter satellite images may offer a low-cost and high-efficiency approach to automatically detect craters and estimate UXO density. Machine-learning methods from the meteor crater literature are ill-suited to find bomb craters, which are smaller than meteor craters and have high appearance variation, particularly in spectral reflectance and shape, due to the complex terrain environment. A two-stage learning-based framework is created to address these challenges. First, a simple and loose statistical classifier based on histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and spectral information is used for a first pass of crater recognition. In a second stage, a patch-dependent novel spatial feature is developed through dynamic mean-shift segmentation and SIFT descriptors. We apply the model to a multispectral WorldView-2 image of a Cambodian village, which was heavily bombed during the Vietnam War. The proposed method increased true bomb crater detection by over 160 percent. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms typical object-recognition algorithms and can be used for wide-area bomb crater detection. Our model, combined with declassified records and demining reports, suggests that 44 to 50 percent of the bombs in the vicinity of this particular Cambodian village may remain unexploded.

TI  - Leaf water potential of coffee estimated by landsat-8 images
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, water conditions of coffee areas are monitored by measuring the leaf water potential (psi(W)) throughout a pressure pump. However, there is a demand for the development of technologies that can estimate large areas or regions. In this context, the objective of this study was to estimate the psi(W) by surface reflectance values and vegetation indices obtained from the Landsat-8/OLI sensor in Minas Gerais-Brazil Several algorithms using OLI bands and vegetation indexes were evaluated and from the correlation analysis, a quadratic algorithm that uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) performed better, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.82. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) was performed to validate the models and the best results were for NDVI quadratic algorithm, presenting a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 27.09% and an R-2 of 0.85. Subsequently, the NDVI quadratic algorithm was applied to Landsat-8 images, aiming to spatialize the psi(W) estimated in a representative area of regional coffee planting between September 2014 to July 2015. From the proposed algorithm, it was possible to estimate psi(W) from Landsat-8/OLI imagery, contributing to drought monitoring in the coffee area leading to cost reduction to the producers.

TI  - Modelling of evapotranspiration using land surface energy balance and thermal infrared remote sensing
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ET) is a key factor in crop water scheduling. The objective of this study was to estimate ET from the high-resolution satellite remote sensing data with integration of in situ observation. The surface energy balance model, Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) was utilised in this study for its simplicity, advantages, and effectiveness. It is a one-source model, which calculates the net radiation, soil heat flux, and sensible heat flux at every pixel level, and estimates the latent heat flux as the residual term in that energy budget equation. Intermediate steps like calculation of NDVI, surface temperature, and albedo served as important input parameters for ET estimate. Landat-8 satellite images were used to compute the ET in paddy field near CRRI, Cuttack, Odisha state in eastern India. Results indicated that the METRIC algorithm provided reasonably good ET over the study area with marginal overestimation in comparison to field observation by eddy covariance data. The satellite-based ET estimates represented in spatial scale has potential in improving irrigation scheduling and precise water resource management at local scales.

TI  - Evaluating links between dynamic urban landscapes and under-five child mortality in Accra, Ghana
T2  - DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVEThe primary objectives of this study are to examine intra-urban spatial variation in the rates of under-five-years-old child mortality (5q0) in Accra in 2000 and 2010, as well as between those two dates, and to evaluate potential connections between the physical characteristics of urban neighborhoods and their levels of child mortality.METHODSDecennial census data of Ghana are used to estimate rates of 5q0 in 2000 and in 2010 and to note changes between 2000 and 2010 for the neighborhoods of Accra. Remote sensing data and methods are then used to derive urban land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) information for the same neighborhoods and during the same time period. Population and housing demographic characteristics are derived and summarized at the neighborhood level to serve as potential covariates of the measures of urban change. Regression analyses are utilized to evaluate the relationships between child mortality and neighborhood environmental factors.RESULTSResults indicate spatial variability in rates of 5q0 in Accra for the year 2000. Such variations are minimal in 2010 due to the dramatic decline in child mortality between 2000 and 2010. Under-five child mortality was 20% in 2000 and 12% in 2010. Nontraditional toilet types and water supply sources are associated with high rates of 5q0.CONCLUSIONSLess reliance on public and informal toilets as well as improving housing drinking water quality have the potential to reduce under-five child mortality in Ghana.CONTRIBUTIONBy analyzing an extensive list of exploratory variables derived by combining remote sensing and demographic data, this paper increases our understanding of the factors associated with under-five child mortality.

TI  - The expanding landscape of inflammatory cells affecting cancer therapy
T2  - NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMCs) are critical regulators of cancer growth. The different phenotypes, functions and therapeutic effects of these phagocytes have, however, been difficult to study. With the advent of single-cell-based technologies, a new 'worldview' is emerging: the classification of TIMCs into subtypes that are conserved across patients and across species. As the landscape of TIMCs is beginning to be understood, it opens up questions about the function of each TIMC subtype and its drugability. In this Perspective, we outline the current map of TIMC populations in cancer and their known and presumed functions, and discuss their therapeutic implications and the biological research questions that they give rise to. The answers should be particularly relevant for bioengineers, materials scientists and the chemical and pharmaceutical communities developing the next generation of cancer therapies.This Perspective outlines the current map and known functions of populations of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in cancer, and discusses their implications for cancer therapy and biological research.

TI  - Rapid generation of global forest cover map using Landsat based on the forest ecological zones
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The easy and ready access to Landsat datasets and the ever-lowering costs of computing make it feasible to monitor the Earth's land cover at Landsat resolutions of 30 m. However, producing forest-cover products rapidly and on a large scale, such as intercontinental or global, is still a challenging task. By utilizing the huge catalog of satellite imagery as well as the high-performance computing capacity of Google Earth Engine, we proposed an automated pipeline for generating 30-m resolution global-scale forest map from time-series of Landsat images. We describe the methods to create products of forest cover at a global scale. First, we partitioned the landscapes into subregions of similar forest type and spatial continuity. Then, a multisource forest/nonforest sample set was established for machine algorithm learning training. Finally, a random forest classifier algorithm was used to obtain samples automatically, extract the characteristics of satellite images, and establish the forest/nonforest classifier models. Taking Landsat8 images in 2018 as a case, a novel 30-m resolution global forest cover (GFC30) map has been produced. The result shows that by the end of 2018, the total forest area in the world was 3.71 x 10(9) ha. The accuracy evaluation of GFC30 for 2018 was carried out using verification points via stratified random sampling of a MODIS land cover map (MCD12C1 product in 2012) and verified on high-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Google Earth). According to the validation result, the overall accuracy of GFC30 for 2018 is 90.94%. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.

TI  - On the 'Arab Inequality Puzzle': The Case of Egypt
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article surveys and discusses prominent protagonists of the debate on socio-economic inequality in the Arab region, with a special focus on the World Bank and Egypt. According to official data, the region holds remarkably low Gini coefficients in a context of declining inequality. This contradicts the popular perception of high social inequality as a major cause of regional protests since the Arab Spring; hence the reference to a 'puzzle' in mainstream literature. The debate about the reality of social inequality in the region has developed since 2011 - particularly in regard to Egypt, where income and consumption data are periodically collected by means of household surveys. Inequality measures based on this method alone, while income taxation data are inaccessible, are highly questionable and conflict with various observations and calculations based on other indicators such as national accounts, executive income or house prices. Yet, the World Bank upholds official inequality findings in portraying the Arab upheaval as the revolt of a 'middle class' that aspires to greater business freedom, in consonance with the neoliberal worldview.

TI  - Data assimilation of in situ and satellite remote sensing data to 3D hydrodynamic lake models: a case study using Delft3D-FLOW v4.03 and OpenDA v2.4
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of physical dynamics is crucial to provide scientifically credible information on lake ecosystem management. We show how the combination of in situ observations, remote sensing data, and three-dimensional hydrodynamic (3D) numerical simulations is capable of resolving various spatiotemporal scales involved in lake dynamics. This combination is achieved through data assimilation (DA) and uncertainty quantification. In this study, we develop a flexible framework by incorporating DA into 3D hydrodynamic lake models. Using an ensemble Kalman filter, our approach accounts for model and observational uncertainties. We demonstrate the framework by assimilating in situ and satellite remote sensing temperature data into a 3D hydrodynamic model of Lake Geneva. Results show that DA effectively improves model performance over a broad range of spatiotemporal scales and physical processes. Overall, temperature errors have been reduced by 54 %. With a localization scheme, an ensemble size of 20 members is found to be sufficient to derive covariance matrices leading to satisfactory results. The entire framework has been developed with the goal of near-real-time operational systems (e.g., integration into meteolakes.ch ).

TI  - Evaluation of CNN model by comparing with convolutional autoencoder and deep neural network for crop classification on hyperspectral imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of crops is an important topic in the agricultural domain. Hyperspectral remote sensing data are very useful for crop feature extraction and classification. Remote sensing data is an unstructured data and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can work on unstructured data efficiently. This paper presents an evaluation of CNN for crop classification using the Indian Pines standard dataset obtained from the AVIRIS sensor and the study area dataset obtained from the EO-1hyperion sensor. Optimized CNN has been tuned by training the model on different parameters. It has been compared with two classification algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Autoencoder. According to the test results, the proposed optimized CNN model provided better results as compared to the other two methods. CNN has given 97 +/- 0.58% overall accuracy for the Indian Pines standard dataset and 78 +/- 2.43% for our study area dataset.

TI  - The impact of new universal child influenza programs in Australia: Vaccine coverage, effectiveness and disease epidemiology in hospitalised children in 2018
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: New jurisdictionally-based vaccination programs were established providing free quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) for preschool Australian children in 2018. This was in addition to the National Immunisation Program (NIP) funded QIV for Indigenous children and children with comorbid medical conditions. We assessed the impact of this policy change on influenza disease burden and vaccine coverage, as well as report on 2018 vaccine effectiveness in a hospital-based surveillance system.Methods: Subjects were recruited prospectively from twelve PAEDS-FluCAN sentinel hospital sites (April until October 2018). Children aged <= 16 years hospitalised with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza were considered cases. Hospitalised children with ARI who tested negative for influenza were considered controls. VE estimates were calculated from the adjusted odds ratio of vaccination in cases and controls.Results: A total of 458 children were hospitalised with influenza: 31.7% were <2 years, 5.0% were Indigenous, and 40.6% had medical comorbidities predisposing to severe influenza. Influenza A was detected in 90.6% of children (A/H1N1: 38.0%; A/H3N2: 3.1%; A/unsubtyped 48.6%). The median length of stay was 2 days (IQR: 1,3) and 8.1% were admitted to ICU. Oseltamivir use was infrequent (16.6%). Two in-hospital deaths occurred (0.45%). 12.0% of influenza cases were vaccinated compared with 36.0% of test-negative controls. Vaccine effectiveness of QIV for preventing influenza hospitalisation was estimated at 78.8% (95%CI: 66.9; 86.4).Conclusions: Compared with 2017 (n = 1268 cases), a significant reduction in severe influenza was observed in Australian children, possibly contributed to by improved vaccine coverage and high vaccine effectiveness. Despite introduction of jurisdictionally-funded preschool programs and NIP-funded vaccine for children with risk factors for severe disease, improved coverage is required to ensure adequate protection against paediatric influenza morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Evaluating temporal and spatial variability and trend of aerosol optical depth (550 nm) over Iran using data from MODIS on board the Terra and Aqua satellites
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our knowledge of the temporal-spatial variations of atmospheric aerosols is necessary because they can affect public health and air quality. This paper studied Collection 6, the product of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD 550 nm), using the Deep Blue algorithm of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites over Iran from 2003 to 2017. Long-term data of the dust using synoptic stations were also used. The results showed that the southwestern Iran, the Persian Gulf coast from Bushehr to Bandar Abbas, and the Makran coastal area in southeastern Iran have the highest seasonal means of Aerosol optical depth (AOD > 0.3) and that they are among the aerosol hotspot areas in southwestern Asia. Other regions in Iran, especially the northwest and the Zagros Mountains, have the lowest aerosol optical depth (AOD < 0.04). The highest AOD amount of Terra (0.144) and Aqua (0.156) occurs in the spring, and the lowest amount occurs in the autumn season (0.094 and 0.101 Terra and Aqua, respectively). The heights act as a barrier on the particle transport pathway and, as a result, will affect the release of dust on local and regional scales. AOD increase in Iran is more related to aerosol loading in deserts and arid areas around the country. The AOD increase during the cold period of the year in industrial cities is due to the combustion of fossil fuels and the reduction of the boundary layer height (BLH). It is because most atmospheric pollutants are released in the boundary layer and are homogenized through turbulent mixed layer processes. The most prominent active dust sources around Iran, which are the main source of aerosol increase, can be categorized into four sources: (1) Mesopotamian, (2) Northern Arabian Peninsula, (3) Elrob Elkhali desert, and (4) East Arabian Peninsula. The AOD seasonal trend showed that the most significant increasing trend occurs in autumn on the TERRA (42.82%) and Aqua (32.32%) satellites. The largest decreasing trend of AOD in Iran is observed in winter in Kermanshah province (- 0.0011 year(-1)) in western Iran and in other seasons in southeastern Iran for which meteorological changes play a major role.

TI  - Analysis and mapping of present and future drivers of local urban climate using remote sensing: a case of Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is the main driver of expanding industry, transport, and buildings at the cost of green spaces in the world's mega cities. Consequently, an immense land use change is related to local climate modification in urban areas. The process of urbanization in the city of Lahore is posing severe environmental issues such as recent smog events. The objective here is to determine and analyze the spatial variability of land surface temperature (LST) caused by the land use land cover (LULC) change between the year 1996 and 2016 in Lahore in the context of urbanization and, based on this, to predict the land use change and corresponding increase in LST in 2035. To quantify LULC change during the 1996-2016 period, we used supervised maximum likelihood method and ground observations from 400 locations to classify the satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) for the years 1996, 2010, and 2016. Moreover, to better understand spatial variability of surface urban heat island (UHI) with the process of urbanization, various indicators were derived from the remote sensing imagery, including the normalized difference vegetation and built-up indices (i.e., NDVI and NDBI, respectively). Moreover, we used an RS-integrated multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain analysis (MLP-MCA) model to predict the LULC change from the year 2016 to 2035 so that the predicted LULC change, as a driver of UHI, can be related to the future local climate of the city. Through relating LST with NDVI and NDBI, we reveal that rapid developments in the residential/infrastructural sectors are causing an immense degradation in the city vegetation areas. The LULC change analyses show that about 9% decrease in green areas during 1996-2016 caused an increase in 6(circle)C around the built-up areas and an overall difference of 4.8(circle)C between built-up and nearby sub-urban vegetation areas. Keeping this and MLP-MCA-based predictions for 2035 in view, we conclude that a future 3% decrease in vegetation-covered green areas will approximately cause an increase of 2(circle)C by 2035. The research output will help the city government and local developers to devise sustainable policies for land use planning and urban development.

TI  - Shrub and vegetation cover predict resource selection use by an endangered species of desert lizard
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, no species is exempt from the constraints associated with limited available habitat or resources, and endangered species in particular warrant critical examination. In most cases, these species are restricted to limited locations, and the relative likelihood of resource use within the space they can access is important. Using Gambelia sila, one of the first vertebrate species listed as endangered, we used resource selection function analysis of telemetry and remotely sensed data to identity key drivers of selected versus available locations for this species in Carrizo Plain National Monument, USA. We examined the probability of selection given different resource types. Increasing shrub cover, lower and relatively more flat sites, increasing normalized difference vegetation index, and solar radiation all significantly predicted likelihood of observed selection within the area sampled. Imagery data were also validated with fine-scale field data showing that large-scale contrasts of selection relative to available location patterns for animal species are a useful lens for potential habitat. Key environmental infrastructure such as foundation plant species including shrubs or local differences in the physical attributes were relevant to this endangered species.

TI  - Evaluation of State and Bias Estimates for Assimilation of SMOS Retrievals Into Conceptual Rainfall-Runoff Models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - For an accurate estimation of land surface state variables through remote sensing data assimilation, it is important to estimate the forecast and observation biases as well. This study focuses on the evaluation of a methodology to estimate land surface state variables, together with model forecast and observation biases. Two conceptual rainfall-runoff models (HBV and GRKAL) are used for this purpose. Soil moisture data, retrieved by the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, are assimilated into these models for 59 unregulated sub-basins of the Murray-Darling basin in Australia. When both models simulate similar soil moisture values, the methodology results in similar forecast and observation bias estimates for both models. The same behavior is obtained when the temporal evolution of the soil moisture simulations is different, but with a similar long-term mean climatology. However, when the long-term mean climatology of both models is different, but with a similar temporal evolution, the bias estimates from both models have a different climatology as well, but with a high temporal correlation. The overall conclusion from this paper is that observation bias estimation is of key importance when updating internal state variables in a conceptual rainfall-runoff system that is calibrated to produce realistic discharge output for possibly biased internal state variables, and that the relative partitioning of bias into forecast and observation bias remains a model-dependent challenge.

TI  - Evaluating Prevalence and Patterns of Prescribing Medications for Depression for Patients With Obesity Using Large Primary Care Data (Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Depression is a serious disorder that brings a tremendous health and economic burden. Many antidepressants (AD) have obesogenic effects, increasing the population of obese patients at increased risk for a more severe disease course and poor treatment response. In addition, obese patients with depression may not be receiving the recommended standard of care due to "obesity bias." It is important to evaluate prescribing pharmacological treatment of depression in patients with obesity.Objectives: To describe the prevalence and patterns of AD prescribing for patients with depression and comorbid obesity compared with normal weight patients, and to examine the association of prescribing prevalence with obesity class.Methods: Study sample of adult patients (>18 years old) with depression was extracted from the national Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) Electronic Medical Records database for 2011-2016. Measures were prescribing of at least one AD (outcome) and body mass index (BMI) to categorize patients into weight categories (exposure). Data were analyzed cross-sectionally using descriptive statistics and mixed effects logistic regression model with clustering on CPCSSN networks and adjusting for age, sex, and the comorbidities.Results: Of 120,381 patients with depression, 63,830 patients had complete data on studied variables (complete cases analysis). Compared with normal weight patients, obese patients were more likely to receive an AD prescription (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.17; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.12-1.22). Patients with obesity classes II and III were 8% (95% CI: 1.00, 1.16) and 6% (95% CI: 0.98, 1.16) more likely, respectively, to receive AD. After imputing missing data using Multiple Imputations by Chained Equations, the results remained unchanged. The prevalence of prescribing >3 AD types was higher in obese category (7.27%, [95% CI: 6.84, 7.73]) than in normal weight category (5.6%; [95% CI: 5.24, 5.99]).Conclusion: The association between obesity and high prevalence of AD prescribing and prescribing high number of different AD to obese patients, consistent across geographical regions, raises a public health concern. Study results warrant qualitative studies to explore reasons behind the difference in prescribing, and quantitative longitudinal studies evaluating the association of AD prescribing patterns for obese patients with health outcomes.

TI  - Algal photophysiology drives darkening and melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Blooms of Zygnematophycean "glacier algae" lower the bare ice albedo of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), amplifying summer energy absorption at the ice surface and enhancing meltwater runoff from the largest cryospheric contributor to contemporary sea-level rise. Here, we provide a step change in current understanding of algal-driven ice sheet darkening through quantification of the photophysiological mechanisms that allow glacier algae to thrive on and darken the bare ice surface. Significant secondary phenolic pigmentation (11 times the cellular content of chlorophyll a) enables glacier algae to tolerate extreme irradiance (up to similar to 4,000 mu mol photons center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) while simultaneously repurposing captured ultraviolet and short-wave radiation for melt generation. Total cellular energy absorption is increased 50-fold by phenolic pigmentation, while glacier algal chloroplasts positioned beneath shading pigments remain low-light-adapted (E-k similar to 46 mu mol photons center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) and dependent upon typical nonphotochemical quenching mechanisms for photoregulation. On the GrIS, glacier algae direct only similar to 1 to 2.4% of incident energy to photochemistry versus 48 to 65% to ice surface melting, contributing an additional similar to 1.86 cm water equivalent surface melt per day in patches of high algal abundance (similar to 10(4) cells center dot mL(-1)). At the regional scale, surface darkening is driven by the direct and indirect impacts of glacier algae on ice albedo, with a significant negative relationship between broadband albedo (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS]) and glacier algal biomass (R-2 = 0.75, n = 149), indicating that up to 75% of the variability in albedo across the southwestern GrIS may be attributable to the presence of glacier algae.

TI  - Elevational differences in the net primary productivity response to climate constraints in a dryland mountain ecosystem of northwestern China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland mountain ecosystems regulate global terrestrial carbon cycling and show high sensitivity to climate variability. The Qilian Mountains (QLMs) typify dryland mountain ranges in northern temperate belts and offer fundamental ecosystem services including forage production and water conservation. However, dominant controls on the interannual trend and variability of net primary productivity (NPP) in this region are unknown. Thus, we examined magnitude and direction of the NPP trend and quantified NPP sensitivity to temperature and precipitation under different biomes and altitudes using ground and remote sensing data. Our results showed that 12% of the QLMs had a reversed NPP trend from increasing to decreasing from 2000 to 2016, particularly in the western and southern parts, where NPP reductions were related to precipitation deficits. About 34% of the QLMs showed accelerated or persistent increasing NPP trends, mainly from the mid-altitude between 3,100 and 4,300 m. The growth rate of NPP was higher in deserts and grasslands than in forests and increased in deserts but decreased in forests and grasslands with increasing elevation. Precipitation showed a stronger effect on the interannual variability in NPP than temperature did. The temperature sensitivity of NPP was similar along elevation gradients in forest steppes but decreased with increasing elevation in alpine deserts. The precipitation sensitivity of NPP reached highest in shrubby meadows when compared with coniferous forests and alpine deserts. This research provides new insights into climate controls of the NPP over the QLMs and to present drought as a growing threat to shrubby meadows and alpine deserts.

TI  - Glacier algae foster ice-albedo feedback in the European Alps
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The melting of glaciers and ice sheets is nowadays considered a symbol of climate change. Many complex mechanisms are involved in the melting of ice, and, among these processes, surface darkening due to organic material on bare ice has recently received attention from the scientific community. The presence of microbes on glaciers has been shown to decrease the albedo of ice and promote melting. Despite several studies from the Himalaya, Greenland, Andes, and Alaska, no quantitative studies have yet been conducted in the European Alps. In this paper, we made use of DNA sequencing, microscopy and field spectroscopy to describe the nature of glacier algae found at a glacier (Vadret da Morteratsch) of the European Alps and to evaluate their effect on the ice-albedo feedback. Among different algal species identified in the samples, we found a remarkable abundance of Ancylonema nordenskioeldii, a species that has never previously been quantitatively documented in the Alps and that dominates algal blooms on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results show that, at the end of the ablation season, the concentration of Ancylonema nordenskioeldii on the glacier surface is higher than that of other algal species (i.e. Mesotaenium berggrenii). Using field spectroscopy data, we identified a significant correlation between a reflectance ratio (750nm/650nm) and the algae concentration. This reflectance ratio could be useful for future mapping of glacier algae from remote sensing data exploiting band 6 (740nm) and band 4 (665nm) of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2 satellite. Here we show that the biological darkening of glaciers (i.e. the bioalbedo feedback) is also occurring in the European Alps, and thus it is a global process that must be taken into account when considering the positive feedback mechanisms related to glacier melting.

TI  - Orthogonal Fault Rupture and Rapid Postseismic Deformation Following 2019 Ridgecrest, California, Earthquake Sequence Revealed From Geodetic Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the 2019 Mw6.4 and Mw7.1 Ridgecrest, California, earthquake sequence, using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 coseismic interferograms and subpixel offsets to retrieve the three-dimensional (3-D) surface displacements. By inverting the 3-D displacements, optimal dip angles of the earthquake faults and the slip model were obtained. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar-based slip model supplemented with the analysis of GPS data shows that the Mw6.4 event ruptured two orthogonal faults and its major geodetic moment was released by sinistral motion on a NE-SW trending fault that dips 78 degrees NW. Right-lateral slip on NW-SE trending subvertical faults was responsible for the Mw7.1 earthquake. Postseismic analysis with U.S. Geological Survey earthquake catalog and GPS time series at site P595 shows that the postseismic surface deformation following the Mw7.1 event has similar temporal patterns with the postseismic moment release, but requires more energy. This implies that the early aftershocks were likely controlled by rapid afterslip following the mainshock.

TI  - Willingness to pay for an early warning system for infectious diseases
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early warning systems for infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks are designed with the aim of increasing the health safety of citizens. As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people's willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was euro21.80 (median euro10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80-90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks. However, our results have to be interpreted in light of the usual drawbacks of willingness to pay experiments.

TI  - Resolving the Puzzle of Conspiracy Worldview and Political Activism: Belief in Secret Plots Decreases Normative but Increases Nonnormative Political Engagement
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a hitherto open and debated question whether the belief in conspiracies increases or attenuates the willingness to engage in political action. In the present article, we tested the notion, whether (a) the relation between belief in conspiracies and general political engagement is curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) and (b) there may be opposing relations to normative versus nonnormative forms of political engagement. Two preregistered experiments (N = 194, N = 402) support both propositions and show that the hypothetical adoption of a worldview that sees the world as governed by secret plots attenuates reported intentions to participate in normative, legal forms of political participation but increases reported intentions to employ nonnormative, illegal means of political articulation. These results provide first evidence for the notion that political extremism and violence might seem an almost logical conclusion when seeing the world as governed by conspiracies.

TI  - Nordic treatment practices survey and consensus for treatment of eyelid sebaceous carcinoma
T2  - BMC OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The purpose was to describe the Nordic treatment practices and to reach a Nordic consensus for the treatment of sebaceous eyelid carcinoma. Methods The treatment practices data was collected by a questionnaire with 37 questions to the Nordic oculoplastic surgeons and analyzed. A PubMed MEDLINE database search was done to gather data on the published treatment practices and recommendations. A working group that consisted of in minimum one senior consultant from each leading Nordic University Eye Hospital was assigned. A structured interactive method was used to establish the consensus. Results Twenty-four doctors responded to the questionnaire. 23/24 (96%) of the respondents took a biopsy before surgery. Regional lymph node scanning was routinely done by 14/23 (61%) and a systemic screening of a metastatic disease by 13/23 (57%). 6/22 (27%) never took conjunctival mapping biopsies and 12/23 (52%) never screened for Muir- Torre. Respondents used Mohs surgery, frozen section or multi-stage excision with delayed closure, and 5-6 mm was the mostly preferred margin. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was a possible option for 9/22 (41%) and cryotherapy and Mitomycin C for 6/22 (27%) respondents. 50% of respondents considered radiation as a treatment option. 15/16 (94%) respondents always followed-up their patients, most for 5 years. Two thirds scanned regional lymph nodes during the follow-up. Consensus was reached for 18 statements representing three domains: preoperative work-up, treatment and follow-up. Conclusion Treatment practices differ in between the five Nordic countries which have similar public health care systems. In the article the authors present a Nordic consensus for the treatment of eyelid sebaceous carcinoma.

TI  - Synergy of Satellite- and Ground-Based Aerosol Optical Depth Measurements Using an Ensemble Kalman Filter Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite- and ground-based remote sensing are two widely used techniques to measure aerosol properties. However, neither is perfect in that satellite retrievals suffer from various sources of uncertainties, and ground observations have limited spatial coverage. In this study, focusing on improving estimates of aerosol information on large scale, we develop a data synergy technique based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to effectively combine these two types of measurements and yield a monthly mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) product with global coverage and improved accuracy. We first construct a 474-member ensemble using 11 monthly mean AOD data sets to represent the variability of the AOD field. Then Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOD retrievals are selected as the background field into which ground-based measurements from 135 Aerosol Robotic Network sites are assimilated using the EnKF. Compared with satellite data, the bias and root-mean-square errors of the combined field are greatly reduced, and correlation coefficients are greatly improved. Moreover, cross validation shows that at locations where surface observations were not assimilated, the reduction in root-mean-square error and bias and the increase in correlation can still reach 20%. Locations where the spatial representativeness of AOD is large or the site density is high are where the greatest changes are typically found. This study shows that the EnKF technique effectively extends the information obtained at surface sites to a larger area, paving the way for combining information from different types of measurements to yield better estimates of aerosol properties as well as their space-time variability.

TI  - Impact of Satellite Observations on Forecasting Sudden Stratospheric Warmings
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The observational impacts of satellite data assimilation on extended-range forecasts of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are investigated by conducting ensemble forecast experiments. We use two Japanese novel reanalysis products: the Japanese 55-year reanalysis (JRA-55) and its subset that assimilates conventional observations only (JRA-55C). A comparative examination on the reproducibility for SSWs between the two ensemble forecasts reveals that the impact of satellite observations is significant for forecasts starting 5 days before the SSW onset, with 20% less accuracy in the JRA-55C forecasts. Moreover, some of forecasts of vortex-splitting SSWs show a sudden appearance of deep difference, which lasts over a fewmonths in the lower stratosphere and significantly affects the surface climate. These results highlight an important role of mesospheric and upper stratospheric circulations on the onset and development of SSWs.Plain Language Summary Satellite observations are valuable for producing initial conditions for numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, especially over the upper stratosphere that typical upper-air observations cannot cover. However, many NWP models suffer from biases associated with unresolved processes. This study explores how the NWP system benefited from satellite data in forecasting the breakdown events of stratospheric polar vortexes/sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) by making many forecasts from typical initial conditions, both with and without satellite data. Due to unresolved bias over the upper stratosphere, some forecasts from no-satellite initial conditions miss the onset of SSWs and subsequent anomalous tropospheric conditions. Thus, the deteriorated grasp of the upper atmosphere in the absence of satellite observations degrades the deterministic predictability of extreme stratospheric events and following downward-propagating signals.

TI  - Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) v2.0-technical overview
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the second major release of the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostic and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Compared to version 1.0, released in 2016, ESMValTool version 2.0 (v2.0) features a brand new design, with an improved interface and a revised preprocessor. It also features a significantly enhanced diagnostic part that is described in three companion papers. The new version of ESMValTool has been specifically developed to target the increased data volume of CMIP Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the related challenges posed by the analysis and the evaluation of output from multiple high-resolution or complex ESMs. The new version takes advantage of state-of-the-art computational libraries and methods to deploy an efficient and user-friendly data processing. Common operations on the input data (such as regridding or computation of multi-model statistics) are centralized in a highly optimized preprocessor, which allows applying a series of preprocessing functions before diagnostics scripts are applied for in-depth scientific analysis of the model output. Performance tests conducted on a set of standard diagnostics show that the new version is faster than its predecessor by about a factor of 3. The performance can be further improved, up to a factor of more than 30, when the newly introduced task-based parallelization options are used, which enable the efficient exploitation of much larger computing infrastructures. ESMValTool v2.0 also includes a revised and simplified installation procedure, the setting of user-configurable options based on modern language formats, and high code quality standards following the best practices for software development.

TI  - De-escalation of axillary surgery in breast cancer patients treated in the neoadjuvant setting: a Dutch population-based study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose An overall trend is observed towards de-escalation of axillary surgery in patients with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate this trend in patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Methods Patients with cT1-4N0-3 breast cancer treated with NST (2006-2016) were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients were classified by clinical node status (cN) and type of axillary surgery. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the clinicopathological factors associated with performing ALND in cN+ patients. Results A total of 12,461 patients treated with NST were identified [5830 cN0 patients (46.8%), 6631 cN+ patients (53.2%)]. In cN0 patients, an overall increase in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only (not followed by ALND) was seen from 11% in 2006 to 94% in 2016 (p < 0.001). SLNB performed post-NST increased from 33 to 62% (p < 0.001). In cN+ patients, an overall decrease in ALND was seen from 99% in 2006 to 53% in 2016 (p < 0.001). Age (OR 1.01, CI 1.00-1.02), year of diagnosis (OR 0.47, CI 0.44-0.50), HER2-positive disease (OR 0.62, CI 0.52-0.75), clinical tumor stage (T2 vs. T1 OR 1.32, CI 1.06-1.65, T3 vs. T1 OR 2.04, CI 1.58-2.63, T4 vs. T1 OR 6.37, CI 4.26-9.50), and clinical nodal stage (N3 vs. N1 OR 1.65, CI 1.28-2.12) were correlated with performing ALND in cN+ patients. Conclusions ALND decreased substantially over the past decade in patients treated with NST. Assessment of long-term prognosis of patients in whom ALND is omitted after NST is urgently needed.

TI  - Sky visibility estimation based on GNSS satellite visibility: an approach of GNSS-based context awareness
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning in urban areas does not currently provide accurate and stable performance because surrounding buildings can block and reflect satellite signals. However, if we can determine the environment in which the receiver is located, appropriate positioning can be applied. For example, GNSS real-time kinematic and 3D-mapping-aided GNSS (3DMA GNSS) are used for positioning in open sky and urban areas, respectively. Thus, the context awareness of the GNSS receiver is important. In fact, an urban canyon can be further categorized into different levels based on sky visibility. We propose an innovative algorithm based on this categorization, which can provide information on surrounding buildings and give an estimation of sky visibility from raw GNSS measurements. This idea was inspired by the use of low-orbit satellite data for remote sensing applications. The recent development of multi-GNSS has led to a notable increase in the number of navigation satellites. Crucially, the visibility of satellites and the blockage of line-of-sight satellite signals are representative of the surrounding environment. The visibility of satellites can be classified by machine learning techniques, and an accurate classification can afford an estimation that is close to the real-sky visibility, as derived from a 3D building model and ground truth location. To assess the sensitivity of our proposed sky visibility estimation algorithm, we simulate different classification accuracies to investigate their effect on the performance of the algorithm.

TI  - Assessment with remotely sensed soil moisture products and ground-based observations over three dense network
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in hydrological processes, bio-ecological processes, and biogeochemical processes. Long-term observations of soil moisture over large areas are critical to research on flooding and drought monitoring, water resource management, and crop yield forecasts. In this paper, Fengyun (FY3B and FY3C) SM products, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) SM products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) AMSR2 L3 SM products, the Version 2 (v2) global land parameter data record (LPDR) of SM products, Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS (CATDS) L3 SM products, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) passive L3 SM products and the European Space Agency(ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM products were evaluated using the ground-based observations in the Little Washita, Fort Cobb and Yanco networks. Long-time series comparison between measured and satellite products was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of FY3 series satellites SM products. Bias (mean bias), R (correlation coefficient), RMSE (root mean square error) and ubRMSE (unbiased root mean square error) were calculated to explore the agreement between satellite products and in-situ measurements. Taylor diagrams were used to compare the performance of various satellite products. The result showed that (1) FY3B, FY3C and LPRM AMSR2 ascending and descending products had an obvious overestimate with in-situ soil moisture in three networks. (2) JAXA AMSR2 ascending and descending products had considerable underestimation in three networks. (3) The validation result of SMOS ascending and descending products over the three networks was satisfactory, with a rather high correlation than other X-band products. (4) The validation result of SMAP ascending and descending products outperformed the other products over the Little Washita and Fort Cobb networks. (5) The ESA CCI product had the lowest values of RMSE and ubRMSE than the other products in the Yanco network, revealing the effectiveness of merging active and passive soil moisture products. (6)The LPDR descending SM products had better performance than the LPDR ascending SM products in the LW and FC networks.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Detection Using Dynamic Time Warping-Based Time Series Clustering Method
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely monitoring of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is useful for understanding the various impacts of human activity on the urban environment. In order to demonstrate the advantage of time series imaging for urban LULC change detection, we selected time series Landsat images over a two-year period to detect inter-annual changes. A time series trajectory for each pixel was developed by the biophysical composition index (BCI) and normalized vegetation index (NDVI) values extracted from Landsat images. Considering that temporal length of trajectories in different years might be different, the dynamic time warping (DTW) measure was selected as the LULC change magnitude indicator. After DTW-based change/unchanged detection, the DTW-based clustering method was used in LULC change type extraction. Finally, the overall accuracy of change/unchanged detection result was 92.3%, and the overall accuracy of all change types was 71%. Some change types that are difficult to extract by bi-temporal images were detected, such as inter-class changes between farmland and forest, and intra-class change of farmland, indicating the advantage of time series information in LULC change detection.

TI  - Evaluating satellite retrieved fractional snow-covered area at a high-Arctic site using terrestrial photography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal snow-cover is one of the most rapidly varying natural surface features on Earth. It strongly modulates the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon balance. Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) is an essential snow variable that can be retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we evaluate fSCA retrievals from multiple sensors that are currently in polar orbit: the operational land imager (OLI) on-board Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2 satellites, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Terra and Aqua. We consider several retrieval algorithms that fall into three classes: thresholding of the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), regression on the NDSI, and spectral unmixing. We conduct the evaluation at a high-Arctic site in Svalbard, Norway, by comparing satellite retrieved fSCA to coincident high-resolution snow-cover maps obtained from a terrestrial automatic camera system. For the lower resolution MODIS retrievals, the regression-based retrievals outperformed the unmixing-based retrievals for all metrics but the bias. For the higher resolution sensors (OLI and MSI), retrievals based on NDSI thresholding overestimated the fSCA due to the mixed pixel problem whereas spectral unmixing retrievals provided the most reliable estimates across the board. We therefore encourage the operationalization of spectral unmixing retrievals of fSCA from both OLI and MSI.

TI  - Mapping of Metastatic Level I Axillary Lymph Nodes in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We examined the distribution of pretreatment nodal metastases to the level I axilla (Ax-L1) to assess the appropriateness of current breast atlases and provide guidelines in relationship to easily identifiable anatomic landmarks for accurate delineation of this lymph node (LN) basin.Methods and Materials: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and biopsyproven metastatic Ax-L1 LNs were identified. We related the location of each LN to its most adjacent rib and its distance from the bottom of the humeral head, axillary vessels, and a line connecting the anterior aspects of the pectoralis and latissimus dorsi muscles (P-L line). LNs were mapped onto a representative planning computed tomography scan, and their distribution was used to validate the current Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, and Radiotherapy Comparative Effectiveness breast atlases. Furthermore, we examined metastases to a subregion encompassing the superolateral Ax-L1, irradiation of which correlates highly with lymphedema.Results: We identified 106 eligible patients with 107 biopsied LNs. All LNs fell between the second and fifth ribs (mean, 3.8 +/- 0.56). Mean distance from the inferior aspect of the humeral head was 4.3 +/- 1.6 cm (range, 0.3-8.4). Mean distance from the inferior aspect of the axillary vessels was 2.9 +/- 1.5 cm (range, -0.6 to 5.4). Mean distance from the P-L line was 0.01 +/- 1.9 cm (range, -2.2 to 2.4); negative and positive values denote medial or lateral to the P-L line. A Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-compliant Ax-L1 consensus contour, created from contours by 4 attending breast radiation oncologists, partially or fully missed 45% of mapped LNs. European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology- and Radiotherapy Comparative Effectiveness-compliant Ax-L1 similarly missed 46% and 34% of mapped LNs, respectively. LNs were most frequently missed in the lateral direction. The superolateral Ax-L1 encompassed 9.3% of the mapped LNs.Conclusions: A significant percentage of at-risk Ax-L1 tissue falls outside current contouring atlases. We propose expansion of the recommended Ax-L1 borders, most notably in the lateral direction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of in-situ and multi-sensor satellite observations for long-term water quality monitoring in coastal areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there have been significant efforts in the integration of in-situ and satellite observations for effective monitoring of coastal areas (e.g., the Copernicus program of the European Space Agency). In this study, a 15-year diurnal variation of Water Constituent Concentrations (WCCs) was retrieved from multi-sensor satellite images and in-situ hyperspectral measurements using Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The existing RT model 2SeaColor was inverted against time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements of water leaving reflectances (R-rs [sr(-1)]) for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs (i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM)) on a daily basis between 2003 and 2018 at the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS) located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. At the same time, the existing coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical RT model MOD2SEA was used for the simultaneous retrieval of WCCs from time series of multi-sensor satellite images of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 between 2003 and 2018 over the Dutch Wadden Sea. At the NJS, a direct comparison (Taylor diagram and statistical analysis) showed strong agreement between in-situ and satellite-derived WCC values (Chla: R-2 >= 0.70, RMSE <= 7.5 [mg m(-3)]; SPM: R-2 >= 0.72, RMSE <= 5.5 [g m(-)3]; CDOM absorption at 440 nm: R-2 >= 0.67, RMSE <= 1.7 [m(-1)]). Next, the plausibility of the spatial variation of retrieved WCCs over the study area was evaluated by generating maps of Chla [mg m(-3)], SPM [g m(-3]), and CDOM absorption at 440 nm [m(-1)] from MERIS and OLCI images using the MOD2SEA model. The integration of the spatio-temporal WCC data obtained from in-situ measurements and satellite images in this study finds applications for the detection of anomaly events and serves as a warning for management actions in the complex coastal waters of the Wadden Sea.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite rainfall products for modeling water yield over the source region of Blue Nile Basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall data is a vital input for many ecosystem service modeling in general and hydrological modeling in particular. However, accurate rainfall data with sufficient spatiotemporal distribution is inadequate in the Blue Nile Basin (Ribb watershed) due to uneven distribution of rain gauge networks. Advances in remote sensing science have provided alternative sources of rainfall data with high spatiotemporal resolution. But the accuracies of different satellite rainfall datasets are not uniform across space and time that need to be checked. The overarching objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of four satellite-based rainfall products [Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite and ground-based observations (TAMSAT-v2.0 and v3.0), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data version two (CHIRPS-v2.0), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission version seven (TRMM-3643 v7.0)] in the data-scarce region of the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia. The evaluation was carried out through direct comparison with the observed rainfall and through simulation of annual water yield using InVEST model for monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales. In general, the results show that the performance of satellite rainfall differs in time scale, topography, and method of evaluation. CHIRPS v2.0 rainfall product shows good performance both at monthly (R-2 = 0.83) and annual (r = 0.85) time scales regardless of elevation. TRMM-3643 v7.0 well performed over the mountainous area, which makes it the best rainfall data than other products at seasonal time scale (r = 0.86). CHIRPS v2.0 and TAMSAT v3.0 are equally applicable to that of gauged rainfall data for annual water yield simulation (Bias = 1.01 and 1.08 respectively). The findings of this study indicated the best performance of CHIRPS v2.0 and TAMSAT v3.0 satellite rainfall products, and hence, these products can be used for water management and decision-making process, particularly in the data-scarce watersheds.

TI  - Mapping smallholder and large-scale cropland dynamics with a flexible classification system and pixel-based composites in an emerging frontier of Mozambique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing assessments of land use and land cover change (LULCC) are critical to improve understanding of socio-economic, institutional and ecological processes that lead to and stem from land use change. This is particularly crucial in the emerging frontiers of Southern Africa, where there is a paucity of LULCC studies relative to the humid tropics. This study focuses on Gurue District (5606 km2) of Zambezia province of Mozambique, one of many countries in the region that has experienced a recent growth in foreign investments in agriculture through large-scale land acquisitions, often resulting in land use conversions and modifications. Previous LULCC assessments covering Mozambique have focused on dynamics between natural and anthropogenic land categories, with limited efforts to distinguish the different land use agents associated with these changes, and relating this with social, economic and technological processes. In this study we built a new LULC assessment methodology that leverages the power of open remote sensing data and tools to integrate categorical and continuous training and validation data obtained from field surveys and Collect Earth software within Google Earth Engine. We then examined the suitability of five pixel-based compositing techniques for generating cloud-free Landsat images that can support analysis of land use dynamics in persistently cloudy, mosaic landscapes with more limited Landsat archives. Drawing upon the spectral and textural features of Landsat data in pixel-based composites, we classified land use over three time periods, 2006, 2012 and 2016, and characterized land use change, focusing on changes between small-scale cropland, large-scale mechanized cropland, and other land uses. This method can be upscaled and applied in many parts of Africa with similar historic image availability challenges, and similar economic contexts with great disparities between small-scale unmechanized cropland and very large-scale mechanized cropland, to explore land consolidation dynamics and agent-specific pathways of land use change.

TI  - Respiratory Epithelial Cells Can Remember Infection: A Proof-of-Concept Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human bronchial epithelial cells play a key role in airway immune homeostasis. We hypothesized that these sentinel cells can remember a previous contact with pathogen compounds and respond nonspecifically to reinfection, a phenomenon called innate immune memory. We demonstrated that their preexposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin modify their inflammatory response to a second, nonrelated stimulus, including live pathogens or lipopolysaccharide. Using histone acetyltransferase and methyltransferase inhibitors, we showed that this phenomenon relied on epigenetic regulation. This report is a major breakthrough in the field of multimicrobial respiratory tract infections, wherein control of inflammatory exacerbations is a major therapeutic issue.

TI  - Optimizing Landsat time series length for regional mapping of lidar-derived forest structure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The value of combining Landsat time series and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to produce regional maps of forest structure has been well documented. However, studies are often performed over single study areas or forest types, preventing a robust assessment of the approaches that produce the most accurate estimates. Here, we use Landsat time series data to estimate forest attributes across six Canadian study sites, which vary by forest type, productivity, management regime, and disturbance history, with the goal of investigating which spectral indices and time series lengths yield the most accurate estimates of forest attributes across a range of conditions. We use estimates of stand height, basal area, and stem volume derived from ALS data as calibration and validation data, and develop random forest models to estimate forest structure with Landsat time series data and topographic variables at each site. Landsat time series predictors, which were derived from annual gap-free image composites, included the median, interquartile range, and Theil Sen slope of vegetation indices through time. To investigate the optimal time series length for predictor variables, time series length was varied from 1 to 33 years. Across all six sites, increasing the time series length led to improved estimation accuracy, however the optimal time series length was not consistent across sites. Specifically, model accuracies plateaued at a time series length of similar to 15 years for two sites (R-2 = 0.67-0.74), while the accuracies continued to increase until the maximum time series length was reached (24-29 years) for the remaining four sites (R-2 = 0.45-0.70). Spectral indices that relied on shortwave infrared bands (Tasseled Cap Wetness and Normalized Burn Ratio) were frequently the most important spectral indices. Adding Landsat-derived disturbance variables (time since last disturbance, type of disturbance) did not meaningfully improve model results; however, this finding was largely due to the fact that most recently disturbed stands did not have predictions of forest attributes from ALS, so disturbed sites were poorly represented in the models. As model accuracies varied regionally and no optimal time series length was found, we provide an approach that can be utilized to determine the optimal time series length on a case by case basis, allowing users to extrapolate estimates of forest attributes both spatially and temporally using multispectral time series data.

TI  - Mapping changes in coastlines and tidal flats in developing islands using the full time series of Landsat images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Insights into the dynamics of coastlines and tidal flats at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are essential for sustainable development. Previous studies were generally conducted at relatively coarse temporal intervals, which hardly captured detailed coastal dynamics, especially in rapidly developing islands. In this study, we developed a new method to map the monthly changes in coastlines and tidal flats in the Zhoushan Archipelago during 1985-2017 using the full time series of Landsat images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. First, we built the full time series of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). Second, we derived temporal segments of MNDWI using a binary segmentation algorithm. Third, we classified the corresponding coastal cover types (i.e., water, tidal flats, and land) for each temporal segment based on the features of MNDWI and regional tidal heights. Finally, we identified the change information including conversion types, and turning years and months. Results indicate that the proposed method can well identify turning years with an overall accuracy of 90% and map coastal cover types with overall accuracies of 89-94% in 1985 and 87-92% in 2017. Significant coastline expansions and declines in tidal flats were found in the study area. The areas of water and tidal flats decreased by 6% and 10% during 1985-2017, respectively, while the land area increased by 18%. The land reclamation was accelerated in the recent decade, and mainly occurred on the medium-large islands, their surrounding small islands, and the islands close to the mainland. The proposed framework based on the GEE platform is transferable to investigate coastal dynamics in other areas. The derived information of changes in coastlines and tidal flats is of great use for sustainable management and ecological studies in coastal areas.

TI  - Detecting flowering phenology in oil seed rape parcels with Sentinel-1 and-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel methodology is proposed to robustly map oil seed rape (OSR) flowering phenology from time series generated from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) sensors. The time series are averaged at parcel level, initially for a set of 229 reference parcels for which multiple phenological observations on OSR flowering have been collected from April 21 to May 19, 2018. The set of OSR parcels is extended to a regional sample of 32,355 OSR parcels derived from a regional S2 classification. The study area comprises the northern Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (N) and the southern Bavaria (S) regions in Germany. A method was developed to automatically compute peak flowering at parcel level from the S2 time signature of the Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI) and from the local minimum in S1 VV polarized backscattering coefficients. Peak flowering was determined at a temporal accuracy of 1 to 4 days. A systematic flowering delay of 1 day was observed in the S1 detection compared to S2. Peak flowering differed by 12 days between the N and S. Considerable local variation was observed in the N-S parcel-level flowering gradient. Additional in-situ phenology observations at 70 Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) stations confirm the spatial and temporal consistency between S1 and S2 signatures and flowering phenology across both regions. Conditions during flowering strongly determine OSR yield, therefore, the capacity to continuously characterize spatially the timing of key flowering dates across large areas is key. To illustrate this, expected flowering dates were simulated assuming a single OSR variety with a 425 growing degree days (GDD) requirement to reach flowering. This GDD requirement was calculated based on parcel-level peak flowering dates and temperatures accumulated from 25-km gridded meteorological data. The correlation between simulated and S2 observed peak flowering dates still equaled 0.84 and 0.54 for the N and S respectively. These Sentinel-based parcel-level flowering parameters can be combined with weather data to support in-season predictions of OSR yield, area, and production. Our approach identified the unique temporal signatures of S1 and S2 associated with OSR flowering and can now be applied to monitor OSR phenology for parcels across the globe.

TI  - Annual Landsat time series reveal post-Soviet changes in grazing pressure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate grasslands are globally widespread, play an important role as carbon storage, and harbor unique biodiversity. Livestock grazing is the most widespread land use in temperate grasslands, and understanding the impact of grazing on grassland ecosystems is therefore important. However, monitoring grazing pressure and how it changes is hampered by a lack of adequate tools. The Eurasian steppe belt, extending from Eastern Europe to China has experienced marked changes in grazing pressure. Most notably, livestock numbers in the steppes of Kazakhstan and Russia declined by up to 80% after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991, yet how this impacted spatial patterns of grazing pressure is unclear. To address this research gap, we used all available Landsat data from 1985 to 2017 together with extensive ground reference data on grazing pressure to evaluate a broad range of spectral-temporal metrics regarding their ability to capture grazing pressure. While Tasseled Cap-based disturbance indices performed best, combining all spectral -temporal metrics in a binary random forest classification yielded a grazing class membership probability that strongly outperformed all individual metrics. This new index of grazing pressure correlated well with a range of field-based grazing indicators (e.g., number of dung piles, herbaceous biomass) and yielded highly plausible spatial patterns of grazing pressure. We used this index to reconstruct annual changes in grazing pressure across our 360,000 km(2) study region, and used LandTrendr time series segmentation to identify trends in grazing pressure. Aggregated grazing pressure followed closely known trends in total livestock numbers over the time period we studied. The spatial footprint of heavy grazing was very large before 1991, but decreased by 73 (+/- 2) % until 2017. This now leaves large areas virtually ungrazed, even in close vicinity to settlements and agricultural areas, and despite a recent recovery of livestock numbers. Our analyses uncovered previously unknown hot-spots of heavy grazing during Soviet times (e.g., around watering points). Our findings suggest potential for a further revival of the livestock sector as well as for the restoration of steppe ecosystems. More broadly, our study highlights how the Landsat archive, in combination with field data on grazing, can be used to map grazing pressure reliably across large areas and over long time spans.

TI  - The added value of a regional landslide susceptibility assessment: The western branch of the East African Rift
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting landslide occurrence is of key importance for understanding the geomorphological development of mountain environments as well as to assess the potential risk posed by landsliding to human societies in such environments. Global landslide susceptibility models use a generic model formulation to predict landslide susceptibility anywhere on the planet from openly available data. Regional models, on the contrary, use local information on landslide occurrence to constrain model parameters and may also benefit from better spatial information with respect to controlling factors. This study aims to investigate the added value of the construction of regional landslide susceptibility models (versus global and continental models) in the western branch of the East African Rift, a data-scarce landslide-prone tropical environment. First, a comprehensive landslide database containing 6446 instances was compiled for the study area using Google Earth imagery. Second, three regional data-driven landslide susceptibility models were developed. Third, the efforts to construct these regional models were quantified by analysing how their quality is impacted by (1) the use of more accurate, regional peak ground acceleration and geology data, and (2) an increasing inventory size. Fourth, regional and global/continental models were compared in terms of predictive power and geomorphological plausibility. We observe that global/continental landslide susceptibility models are capable of identifying landslide-prone areas, but lack prediction power and geomorphological plausibility when compared to our regional models. Importantly, this difference in quality is not driven by the use of more accurate and detailed geology and peak ground acceleration data, but rather by the use of a detailed regional landslide inventory to calibrate the models. We also show that the model quality only increases marginally beyond a certain inventory size. We conclude that the regional landslide susceptibility assessment does provide an added value compared to existing global models in terms of geomorphological plausibility and model performance, whereby the largest gain is to be found in the construction of a regional landslide inventory, rather than the investment in more detailed covariates or the application of more complex modelling techniques. The latter suggests that the role of controlling variables depends, to some extent, on the regional context: making adequate susceptibility predictions proves difficult when local conditions are not accounted for by means of a regional inventory.

TI  - Satellite detection of varying seasonal water supply restrictions on grassland productivity in the Missouri basin, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate observations indicate more frequent drought in recent years, and model predictions suggest that drought occurrence will continue to rise with global warming. Understanding drought impacts on ecosystem functioning requires accurate quantification of vegetation sensitivity to changes in water supply condition. This is complicated by the seasonal variation in plant structural and physiological response to water stress, especially for semi-arid grasslands with characteristic strong spatial and temporal variability in carbon uptake. Here, we use complementary satellite soil moisture (SM) and total water storage (TWS) observations to delineate plant-accessible water supply variations for natural grasslands in the Missouri basin, USA. We evaluate how water supply influences the spatiotemporal variations in grassland productivity as a function of seasonal timing and climate condition. We identify a 128-day period from mid-June to early October when grassland growth is sensitive to soil moisture changes. We find the strongest SM sensitivity after the peak of the growing season associated with high temperature and VPD. SM limitation can extend to early and late growing season under warm conditions, while grassland sensitivity to SM is generally stronger in the late growth stage than in the green-up period given similar temperature and soil moisture. We find that complementary to the surface SM observations, TWS provides plant-available water storage information from the deeper soil, and both SM and TWS exert a lagged impact on grassland productivity. We find that the lag between the inter-annual variation of SM and associated plant response increases through the season, and overall there is a transition from SM-limitation to TWS-limitation on productivity during the late growing period when the TWS level is near the seasonal low. Future global change projections should account for a seasonally varying vegetation-moisture relationship to accurately assess the impact of the water supply constraint on plant productivity in a warming climate.

TI  - Care Transition Decisions After a Fall-related Emergency Department Visit: A Qualitative Study of Patients' and Caregivers' Experiences
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Falls are a leading cause of injury-related emergency department (ED) visits and may serve as a sentinel event for older adults, leading to physical and psychological injury. Our primary objective was to characterize patient- and caregiver-specific perspectives about care transitions after a fall. Methods Using a semistructured interview guide, we conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews using grounded theory methodology. We included patients enrolled in the Geriatric Acute and Post-acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) trial aged 65 years and older who had an ED visit for a fall and their caregivers. Patients with cognitive impairment (CI) were interviewed in patient-caregiver dyads. Domains assessed included the postfall recovery period, the skilled nursing facility (SNF) placement decision-making process, and the ease of obtaining outpatient follow-up. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded and analyzed for a priori and emergent themes. Results A total of 22 interviews were completed with 10 patients, eight caregivers, and four patient-caregiver dyads within the 6-month period after initial ED visits. Patients were on average 83 years old, nine of 14 were female, and two of 14 had CI. Six of 12 caregivers were interviewed in reference to a patient with CI. We identified four overarching themes: 1) the fall as a trigger for psychological and physiological change, 2) SNF placement decision-making process, 3) direct effect of fall on caregivers, and 4) barriers to receipt of recommended follow-up. Conclusions Older adults presenting to the ED after a fall report physical limitations and a prominent fear of falling after their injury. Caregivers play a vital role in securing the home environment; the SNF placement decision-making process; and navigating the transition of care between the ED, SNF, and outpatient visits after a fall. Clinicians should anticipate and address feelings of isolation, changes in mobility, and fear of falling in older adults seeking ED care after a fall.

TI  - SealNet: A fully-automated pack-ice seal detection pipeline for sub-meter satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic pack-ice seals, a group of four species of true seals (Phocidae), play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean foodweb as wide-ranging predators of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.

TI  - Worldwide validation of CAMS and MERRA-2 reanalysis aerosol optical depth products using 15 years of AERONET observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution compares 3-hourly estimates of aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) and Angstrom exponent (AE) from two similar reanalysis models, ECMWF's CAMS and NASA's MERRA-2, to reference remotesensed observations from the worldwide AERONET network during the period 2003-2017. All data points are first subjected to a thorough quality assessment analysis. All valid AOD550 reanalysis estimates are also corrected to account for the difference in elevation between the nominal grid cell size (0.5. 0.625.) and the reference AERONET ground station. Comparative results are obtained both on a continental basis and on climate disaggregation basis using the Koppen-Geiger (KG) classification. Based on 793 AERONET stations and.1.8 million valid 3-h data points, it is found that CAMS and MERRA-2 behave relatively similarly, with however some regional differences, depending on continent or KG class. AOD550's root-mean-square error (RMSE) varies in the range 0.031-0.268 for CAMS and 0.017-0.232 for MERRA-2, depending on continent. Globally, MERRA-2 performs better than CAMS, achieving an RMSE of 0.126, as compared to 0.144 for CAMS. In contrast, the two reanalyses have very similar overall RMSEs for AE, i.e., 0.382 for CAMS and 0.378 for MERRA-2. For local or regional studies, these results allow users to select the best possible source of data. For global studies, both aerosol products are found appropriate, albeit with different statistical properties.

TI  - Satellite data reveal southwestern Tibetan plateau cooling since 2001 due to snow-albedo feedback
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the threats that climate change poses to solid water reservoirs on the Tibetan plateau (TP), there is significant interest in understanding spatial patterns of climate change and their causes. Weather station observations have been extensively examined, but are scarce, resulting in an incomplete understanding of climate change across the TP, particularly in the west. Using recent (2001-2015) satellite-based data sets (2 m air temperature, land surface temperature, albedo and snow cover), this study reveals that mean annual 2 m air temperature in the southwestern TP has decreased by 0.15 degrees C/decade in contrast to overall warming (+0.18 degrees C/decade) on the rest of the TP. Up to 45% (74%) of the variance in the annual (spring) 2 m air temperature can be explained by simultaneous change in snow-induced albedo in the southwestern TP. The free atmosphere column over this region and Northwest India is cooling, providing a favourable environment for the decrease in 2 m air temperature observed. Moreover, the anomalous water vapour transport into the southwestern TP is advantageous for increased snowfall and the associated decrease in 2 m air temperature. The implications of this anomalous cooling under global warming have yet to be fully considered, in particular for the futures of glaciers and snowpack over the Himalayan Mountains in the southwestern TP.

TI  - Space-time chlorophyll-a retrieval in optically complex waters that accounts for remote sensing and modeling uncertainties and improves remote estimation accuracy
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values measured by satellite sensors involve large amounts of uncertainty leading to non-negligible noise in remote Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration estimation. This work distinguished between two main stages in the case of estimating distributions of Chl-a within the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada). At the model building stage, the retrieval algorithm used both in-situ Chl-a measurements and the corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L2-level data estimated Rrs at 412, 443, 469, 488, 531, 547, 555, 645, 667, 678 nm at a 1 km spatial resolution during 2004-2013. Through the training and validation of various models and Rrs combinations of the considered eight techniques (including support vector regression, artificial neural networks, gradient boosting machine, random forests, standard CI-OC3M, multiple linear regression, generalized addictive regression, principal component regression), the support vector regression (SVR) technique was shown to have the best performance in Chl-a concentration estimation using Rrs at 412, 443, 488, 531 and 678 nm. The accuracy indicators for both the training (850) and the validation (213) datasets were found to be very good to excellent (e.g., the R-2 value varied between 0.7058 and 0.9068). At the space-time estimation stage, this work took a step forward by using the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) theory to further process the SVR estimated Chl-a concentrations by incorporating the inherent spatiotemporal dependency of physical Chl-a distribution. A 56% improvement was achieved in the reduction of the mean uncertainty of the validation data decreased considerably (from 1.2222 to 0.5322 mg/m(3)). Then, this novel BME/SVR framework was employed to estimate the daily Chl-a concentrations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during Jan 1-Dec 31 of 2017 (1 km spatial resolution). The results showed that the daily mean Chl-a concentration varied from 1.6630 to 3.3431 mg/m(3), and that the daily mean Chl-a uncertainty reduction of the composite BME/SVR vs. the SVR estimation had a maximum reduction value of 1.0082 and an average reduction value of 0.6173 mg/m(3). The monthly spatial Chl-a distribution co-variances showed that the highest Chl-a concentration variability occurred during November and that the spatiotemporal Chl-a concentration pattern changed a lot during the period August to November. In conclusion, the proposed BME/SVR was shown to be a promising remote Chl-a retrieval approach that exhibited a significant ability in reducing the non-negligible uncertainty and improving the accuracy of remote sensing Chl-a concentration estimates.

TI  - Digital elevation model-based convolutional neural network modeling for searching of high solar energy regions
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of potential solar energy at candidate sites plays a key role in the search for high solar energy regions to accommodate solar photovoltaic facilities. However, the estimation of solar irradiation can be inaccurate when site conditions are not similar to the ones at observation stations. In particular, regional effects caused by adjacent terrains have rarely been modeled in the estimation process. This study thus presents a digital elevation map-based convolutional neural network modeling method for the prediction of annual solar irradiation under clear-sky conditions. Using map data as an input, the sole impact of neighboring topography on available solar energy can be understood at a large scale. Specifically, with elevation maps and corresponding solar irradiation maps, the mean of solar irradiation values for each map is calculated. This mean value is then used as an output to identify the non-linear and hidden relationship between such values and the input maps in training processes. The proposed network model uses terrain map datasets and hence enables the recognition and learning of complex topographic features and patterns in the datasets. As a result, the network model has a mean absolute percent error of 0.470% for testing datasets. This implies that the topographic patterns on a large scale may coincide with variations of available solar irradiation prior to the effects of weather. Thus, the integration of raster map data with solar energy prediction has emerged to systematically learn the terrain patterns in order to predict the annual amount of solar irradiation in a region of interest. This approach can aid the determination of suitable locations for the installation of solar panels.

TI  - Global satellite-based river gauging and the influence of river morphology on its application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of a sparse global river gauging station network in decline, new approaches are needed to reconstruct and monitor river discharge from satellite observations. Where in-situ river discharge measurements are not available, it may be possible to use discharge estimates from a hydrological model, provided the model simulations are of sufficient quality, to construct satellite-based discharge gauging. We tested this approach by developing model- and gauge-based satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) using 0.05 degrees MODIS optical remote sensing at similar to 10,000 gauged and similar to 370,000 ungauged river reaches globally. Model-based SGRs are aimed to infer temporal flow patterns and reflect unusually high or low river discharge behavior (i.e, flood or drought conditions), if not necessarily absolute discharge volumes. The model-based SGRs achieved a discharge prediction skill that was often similar to gauge-based SGRs, and sometimes better than the model itself. Our results showed promising opportunities to develop model-based SGRs in sparsely gauged basins in South America, Africa, and Asia. We selected river reaches, with mean widths ranging from 67 to 3105 m, representing both poor and successful SGRs in different environments for case studies to analyze conditions for successful SGR development. River size and morphology were the main factors determining the performance of SGRs. Wide channels with strong temporal variations, broad floodplains and multiple braided or anastomosing channels provided the best conditions for SGRs. The probability of constructing a successful SGR could be predicted from high-resolution inundation summary data available globally, and can thus be predicted anywhere. Ongoing increases in the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing will further increase the number of river reaches for which satellite-based discharge gauging will become possible.

TI  - Identifying and characterizing dust point sources in the southwestern United States using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Documenting geomorphology and land use/land cover associated with the aeolian dust sources is needed to build more robust models simulating wind erosion and dust emission. It is also important to set the base for future studies aiming to quantify the effect of anthropogenic land-use change on dust emission. In this research, dust point sources were detected in the Southern Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert regions of the United States (U.S.) for 2001-2016, encompassing a period of extreme drought. Dust points were detected using overlay analysis of brightness temperature difference images of MODIS and MODIS true color images for the days where dust plumes were visible. This study aims to identify low emission surfaces as well as high emission surfaces in terms of geomorphology and land cover. A total of 1508 dust points were detected, where 1258 points are located in the Southern Great Plains, and 187 points are located in the Chihuahuan Desert. Point pattern analysis showed a significant cluster of these points in West Texas (Nearest Neighbor Ratio = 0.33, p < 0.001) where cultivated lands and grasslands are the dominant land cover and aeolian sand sheet is the dominant geomorphic class. Ephemeral lakes (i.e., playas) produce the most dust sources per unit area. Cultivated croplands enclose 43% of the dust points, while shrublands and grasslands, combined, enclose 45% of the points. Results from this study confirms the importance of playas as a dynamic source of dust in southwestern U.S. Moreover, this study suggests that anthropogenic factors play a major role in dust emission within southwestern U.S, although bare lands in particular that are not subjected to anthropogenic factors (e.g., the White Sands dune field) are also emitting dust. Future research is needed to statistically analyze the contribution of different land-cover types on dust emission in the region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Deriving high-spatiotemporal-resolution leaf area index for agroecosystems in the US Corn Belt using Planet Labs CubeSat and STAIR fusion data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable for characterizing crop growth conditions and estimating crop productivity. Despite continuing efforts to develop LAI estimation algorithms, LAI datasets still need improvement at spatial and temporal resolutions to meet the requirements of agricultural applications. Advancements in data fusion technique and the emergence of new satellite data provide opportunities for LAI data at higher resolutions in both space and time. In this study, we derived new LAI estimations by leveraging novel satellite remote sensing datasets, STAIR fusion (MODIS-Landsat fusion) and Planet Labs' CubeSat data (through a reprocessed pipeline) for a typical agricultural landscape in the U.S. Corn Belt. The STAIR fused data and our reprocessed CubeSat data have both fine spatial resolutions (30 m and 3.125 m, respectively) and high frequencies (daily for both). To reliably estimate LAI from these advanced satellite datasets, we used two methods: inversion of a radiative transfer model (RTM), and empirical relationship with vegetation index (VI) calibrated from field measured LAI. Compared to the ground-truth LAI collected at 36 sites across the study region, reliable approximations were achieved by both LAI estimations based on PROSAIL RTM (STAIR: R-2 = 0.69 and root mean squared error (RMSE) = 1.12 (m(2) m(-2)), CubeSat: R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 1.09 (m(2) m(-2))), and LAI estimations based on Green Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (GrWDRVI) (STAIR: R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.10 (m(2) m(-2)), CubeSat: R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 1.08 (m(2) m(-2)), where validation ground-truth is independent from calibration data). Newly estimated high-resolution LAI data were aggregated at 500 m resolution and compared with MODIS and VIIRS LAI products, revealing substantial uncertainties and biases in these two products. We also demonstrated phenology stage estimation at fine spatial resolutions based on our high-frequency LAI data. The proposed LAI estimation methods at both high spatial resolution and temporal frequency can be applied to the entire U.S. Corn Belt and provide significant advancement to crop monitoring and precision agriculture.

TI  - Data assimilation of high-resolution thermal and radar remote sensing retrievals for soil moisture monitoring in a drip-irrigated vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient water use assessment and irrigation management is critical for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, especially under changing climate conditions. Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground instrumentation over wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical model-based fine-scale mapping of soil water conditions have been applied for water resource applications at a range of spatial scales. Here, we present a prototype framework for integrating high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model with the aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies. Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and surface soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m resolution SVAT model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of California, U.S. The efficacy of our data assimilation algorithm is investigated via both the synthetic and real data experiments. Results demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is superior to an ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship between model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between observations and states and must therefore be represented accurately in the assimilation model. Overall, both surface and root-zone soil moisture predicted via the SVAT model are enhanced through the assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals, suggesting the potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural sub-field-scale using a data assimilation strategy.

TI  - High-resolution retrieval of cloud microphysical properties and surface solar radiation using Himawari-8/AHI next-generation geostationary satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical properties of clouds and heavy aerosol retrieved from satellite measurements are the most important elements for calculating surface solar radiation (SSR). The Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) satellite measurements receive high spatial, temporal and spectral signals, which provides an opportunity to estimate cloud, aerosol and SSR accurately.In this study, we developed the AHI official cloud property product (version 1.0) for JAXA P-Tree system. A look-up table (LUT) method was used to calculate high-temporal (10 min) and high-spatial (5 km) SSR from AHI cloud properties. First, the LUT of the SSR estimation was optimized through a radiative transfer model to account for solar zenith angle, cloud optical thickness (COT), effective particle radius (CER), aerosol optical thickness and surface albedo. Following this, COT and CER were retrieved from the AHI data, with ice cloud parameters being retrieved from an extended Voronoi ice crystal scattering database and water cloud parameters being retrieved from the MieLorenz scattering model. The retrieved COT and CER for water clouds were compared well with MODIS collection 6 cloud property products, with correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. The COT of ice cloud also shows good consistency, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85. Finally, the SSR was calculated based on the SSR LUT and the retrieved cloud optical parameters. The estimated SSR was validated at 122 radiation stations from several observing networks covering the disk region of Himawari-8. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) at CMA (China Meteorological Administration) stations was 101.86 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR and 31.42 Wm(-2) for daily SSR; RMSE at non-CMA stations was 119.07 Wm(-2) for instantaneous SSR, 81.10 Wm(-2) for hourly SSR and 26.58 Wm(-2) for daily SSR. Compared with the SSR estimated from conventional geostationary satellites, the accuracy of the SSR obtained in this study was significantly improved.

TI  - The relationship between urban form and heat island intensity along the urban development gradients
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing demand for urban form optimization to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effect under the background of global climate change and urbanization. However, there is still a lack of understanding about how the relationship between urban form and UHI intensity changes under diverse urbanization contexts. This study aims to show the change patterns of the relationship between urban form and UHI intensity along the urban development gradient based upon the investigation of a total of 150 urban areas in the Jing-Jin-Ji region in China in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. We defined a comprehensive urban development index taking into account the size of urban area, population density and night light intensity to classify the different levels of urban development. A multi-model comparison was carried out to validate the results. We found that the increase in urban continuity, sprawling, scale and density all enhanced UHI effect at the regional scale. However, the relationship between urban form indicators and UHI intensity demonstrated two opposite patterns along the urban development gradient: population density, geometric complexity and continuity, and general vegetation index of a city were found to be increasingly influential, while night light intensity, geometric elongation and forest coverage presented declining influence. Finally, the study obtained an ascending contribution rate curve for urban geometry indicators, a convex curve for urban size indicators and a declining curve for urban vegetation. These changes along the urban development gradient may be closely related to the changes of the micro-climate in cities due to land use, social and economic activities in different urban development stages. The findings can contribute to more appropriate and effective urban planning in countries and regions undergoing rapid urbanization as a valuable reference. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An OLCI-based algorithm for semi-empirically partitioning absorption coefficient and estimating chlorophyll a concentration in various turbid case-2 waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration in turbid case-2 waters is a challenge, owing largely to terrestrial substances (such as minerals and humus) that are optically significant but do not co-vary with phytoplankton. Here, we propose an improved Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) (denoted as TC2) for retrieving Chla concentrations from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) which can be applied to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images in turbid case-2 waters. TC2 has two main extensions when compared with QAA. First, TC2 makes an additional assumption to separate the total non-water absorption at 665 nm (a(nw)(665)) into phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)(665)) and yellow matter (a(ym)(665)), which is the sum of colored dissolved matter (CDOM) and detritus. Second, for selecting the position of the near-infrared (NIR) band which is used to estimate the signal of total backscattering coefficient (b(b)(lambda(0))) at QAA reference band (lambda(0)), we take into account the assumption that the absorption of pure water should be dominant at this band, as well as the impact of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the NIR band on the Chla concentration estimating model. When applied to in situ R-rs(lambda) and OLCI match-up R-rs(lambda) data in this study, TC2 provided more accurate Chla estimation than previous Cha concentration retrieval algorithms for turbid case-2 waters. TC2 has the potential for use as a simple and effective algorithm for monitoring Chla concentrations in the turbid case-2 waters at a global scale from space.

TI  - Mapping cropping intensity in China using time series Landsat and Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropping intensity has undergone dramatic changes worldwide due to the effects of climate changes and human management activities. Cropping intensity is an important factor contributing to crop production and food security at local, regional and national scales, and is a critical input data variable for many global climate, land surface, and crop models. To generate annual cropping intensity maps at large scales, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at 500-m or 250-m spatial resolution have problems with mixed land cover types within a pixel (mixed pixel), and Landsat images at 30-m spatial resolution suffer from low temporal resolution (16-day). To overcome these limitations, we developed a straightforward and efficient pixel- and phenology-based algorithm to generate annual cropping intensity maps over large spatial domains at high spatial resolution by integrating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time series image data for 2016-2018 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. In this pilot study, we report annual cropping intensity maps for 2017 at 30-m spatial resolution over seven study areas selected according to agro-climatic zones in China. Based on field-scale sample data, the annual cropping intensity maps for the study areas had overall accuracy rates of 89-99%, with Kappa coefficients of 0.76-0.91. The overall accuracy of the annual cropping intensity maps was 93%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.84. These cropping intensity maps can also be used to enable identification of various crop types from phenological information extracted from the growth cycle of each crop. These algorithms can be readily applied to other regions in China to generate annual cropping intensity maps and quantify inter-annual cropping intensity variations at the national scale with a greatly improved accuracy.

TI  - Mapping and assessing land cover/land use and aboveground carbon stocks rapid changes in small oceanic islands' terrestrial ecosystems: A case study of Madeira Island, Portugal (2009-2011)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Small islands face environmental issues directly or indirectly related to land cover/land use changes (LCLUC), such as natural hazards, climate change, loss of biodiversity and proliferation of invasive alien species, some of which are caused by direct human exploitation. A Land Cover/Land Use Change (LCLUC) detection approach based on PCA and vegetation indices derived from low cost high-resolution RapidEye multispectral satellite data and available vegetation maps was developed to assess vegetated/forested aboveground carbon stocks and their changes in Madeira Island, Portugal, for the period between December 2009 and August 2011 due to catastrophic events occurred in 2010.During this period, the identified LCLUC revealed a relevant decrease of vegetated areas (especially those dominated by native/endemic communities) substituted by increases of non-vegetated and human-managed vegetated/forested areas. In particular, there was a decrease of 2% of vegetated areas, 30% of which were represented by native/endemic vegetation. The largest and most accurate LCLUC detected were used to estimate changes in aboveground biomass carbon (AGC) stocks. In 2010 more than 25,000 Mg of AGC stocks may have been released. Both relevant LCLUC and AGC stocks depletion in such short period of time may have been strongly enhanced by two catastrophic events that affected Madeira in February (flashflood and landslides) and August 2010 (wildfires). This straightforward and cost-effective methodological approach may be successfully applied in remote territories such as islands or mountainous areas, where the logistic and economic costs associated to periodic and standard airborne remote sensing campaigns for mapping, assessing and monitoring aboveground biomass carbon stocks are generally unaffordable for most decision-makers and land managers in these territories.

TI  - Irrigation retrieval from Landsat optical/thermal data integrated into a crop water balance model: A case study over winter wheat fields in a semi-arid region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring irrigation is essential for an efficient management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. We propose to estimate the timing and the amount of irrigation throughout the agricultural season using optical and thermal Landsat-7/8 data. The approach is implemented in four steps: i) partitioning the Landsat land surface temperature (LST) to derive the crop water stress coefficient (Ks), ii) estimating the daily root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from the integration of Landsat-derived Ks into a crop water balance model, iii) retrieving irrigation at the Landsat pixel scale and iv) aggregating pixel-scale irrigation estimates at the crop field scale. The new irrigation retrieval method is tested over three agricultural areas during four seasons and is evaluated over five winter wheat fields under different irrigation techniques (drip, flood and no-irrigation). The model is very accurate for the seasonal accumulated amounts (R similar to 0.95 and RMSE similar to 44 mm). However, lower agreements with observed irrigations are obtained at the daily scale. To assess the performance of the irrigation retrieval method over a range of time periods, the daily predicted and observed irrigations are cumulated from 1 to 90 days. Generally, acceptable errors (R = 0.52 and RMSE = 27 mm) are obtained for irrigations cumulated over 15 days and the performance gradually improves by increasing the accumulation period, depicting a strong link to the frequency of Landsat overpasses (16 days or 8 days by combining Landsat-7 and -8). Despite the uncertainties in retrieved irrigations at daily to weekly scales, the daily RZSM and evapotranspiration simulated from the retrieved daily irrigations are estimated accurately and are very close to those estimated from actual irrigations. This research demonstrates the utility of high spatial resolution optical and thermal data for estimating irrigation and consequently for better closing the water budget over agricultural areas. We also show that significant improvements can be expected at daily to weekly time scales by reducing the revisit time of high-spatial resolution thermal data, as included in the TRISHNA future mission requirements.

TI  - Pulmonary oxidative stress in wild bats exposed to coal dust: A model to evaluate the impact of coal mining on health
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to verify possible alterations involving histological and oxidative stress parameters in the lungs of wild bats in the Carboniferous Basin of Santa Catarina (CBSC) state, Southern Brazil, as a means to evaluate the impact of coal dust on the health of wildlife. Specimens of frugivorous bat species Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium were collected from an area free of coal dust contamination and from coal mining areas. Chemical composition, histological parameters, synthesis of oxidants and antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative damage in the lungs of bats were analyzed. Levels of Na, Cl, Cu, and Br were higher in both species collected in the CBSC than in the controls. Levels of K and Rb were higher in A. lituratus, and levels of Si, Ca, and Fe were higher in S. lilium collected in the carboniferous basin. Both bat species inhabiting the CBSC areas exhibited an increase in the degree of pulmonary emphysema compared to their counterparts collected from control areas. Sturnira lilium showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) levels, while A. lituratus showed a significant decrease in nitrite levels in the CBSC samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity did not change significantly; however, the activity of catalase (CAT) and levels of glutathione (GSH) decreased in the A. lituratus group from CBSC compared to those in the controls. There were no differences in NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 protein (NQO1) abundance or nitrotyrosine expression among the different groups of bats. Total thiol levels showed a significant reduction in A. lituratus from CBSC, while the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) was higher in both A. lituratus and S. lilium groups from coal mining areas. Our results suggested that bats, especially A. lituratus, living in the CBSC could be used as sentinel species for harmful effects of coal dust on the lungs.

TI  - In search of floating algae and other organisms in global oceans and lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface floating macroalgae, microalgae, and other marine and freshwater organisms have been reported in many specific regions around the globe. However, it is technically challenging to identify similar occurrences, or other types of floating organisms or materials, within the vast global oceans and lakes. In this study, we address this challenge through combining global-scale, 375-m resolution false-colored Red-Green-Blue (FRGB) imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in NOAA's online Ocean Color Viewer (OCView) for visual inspection and data from several other satellite sensors for spectral diagnostics. In the FRGB imagery, the near-infrared (NIR) band (862 nm) is used as the green channel, which is sensitive to floating algae and organisms/materials on the water surface. Visual inspection of the daily FRGB VIIRS imagery from January 2018 to October 2019 reveals the appearance of various slicks with different colors in many ocean regions and lakes. Combined with spectral diagnostics of the quasi-concurrent Sentinel-3A/3B Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and other higher spatial resolution satellite data as well as knowledge of local oceanography/limnology, most of these elongated or diffuse image features can be identified as Ulva, Sargassum, Noctiluca, Trichodesmium, Microcystis, oil slicks, or pumice rafts. Some of these identified features are found in regions where such occurrences have never been reported before. Some features are of unknown type as they have not been reported previously from remote sensing. In such cases, contemporaneous scientific literature and news reports as well as spectral diagnostics allow for educated inferences to be made. One example is from surface features in the northern Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, and Southwest of Nova Scotia between early June and early July of 2019. Spectral shapes of the FRGB image features indicate transparent materials lacking pigments. Knowledge of local fisheries oceanography and frequent news reports all suggest that these unknown image features may be aggregations or blooms of sea jellies and, to a lesser extent, salps. Another example is from the Great Salt Lake, where image features in the south arm of the lake are speculated to be caused by aggregations of brine shrimp eggs. Once confirmed from field sightings, these findings may represent a milestone in satellite remote sensing because previously remote sensing could only be used to infer oceanographic environments conducive to sea jellies or shrimps. In addition to the findings presented here, the approach in this study may serve as a template to discover various known and unknown types of floating algae and organisms/materials as well as to routinely monitor and track their distributions and movements.

TI  - Monitoring biodiversity in the Anthropocene using remote sensing in species distribution models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of the growing challenges brought about by human activities, effective planning and decision-making in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable development are urgently needed. Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on land and below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 15 & 14). The urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re-envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action.A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community, and a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of these models for management and planning.Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbances. We then discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas - such as the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management strategies towards sustainability.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and environmental safety
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The presence of heavy metals (HMs) in the environment can increase their risk of transfer to the food chain. The present study was conducted to investigate the bioaccumulation of HMs including Hg, Cd and Ni in soft and hard tissues of sentinel crab (Macrophthalmus depressus Ruppell, 1830) in sediments of Mousa Bay in northwest of the Persian Gulf. The average (mean±SD) amounts of Hg, Cd and Ni in the sediments were 6.27±3.66, 3.8±1.48 and 71.6±5.09mug/g, whereas the relevant amounts for soft tissues were 6.16±4.64, 3.3±1.7 and 19.7±3.96mug/g, and for hard tissues were, 2.9±1.67, 3.5±1.35 and 10.44±3.1mug/g, respectively. Accordingly, soft tissues of the crab could be suitable bioindicators of Hg and Cd, whereas the hard tissues could be used as Cd bioindicator. Since the bioaccumulation of Ni was the most, it might have a higher risk among the metals to enter the food chain in the region.

TI  - The complementary value of cosmic-ray neutron sensing and snow covered area products for snow hydrological modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A combined snow modelling approach integrating remote sensing data, in-situ data, and an improved hydrological model is presented. Complementary information sources are evaluated in terms of its value for constraining the model parameters and to overcome limitations of individual data such as inadequate scale representation. The study site consists of the Upper Fagge river basin in the Austrian Alps featuring the Weisssee Snow Research Site. The available remote sensing datasets include Terra MODIS based medium resolution and Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A based high resolution fractional snow covered area maps. Recently, Sentinel-1 based wet snow covered area maps have become increasingly available. To the knowledge of the authors the first evaluation of their value for snow-hydrological modelling is presented. Besides conventional small footprint station data, in-situ time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE) of a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) having a footprint of several hectares is additionally used. For including these data the model now provides respective outputs such as fractional snow cover, wet/dry snow surface and SWE areal means equivalent to the CRNS sensor footprint. By means of 40,000 model runs the high complementary value of representative SWE data and remote sensing information was assessed with most promising results achieved by combining high resolution fractional snow covered area maps with CRNS-SWE data. Regarding mean SWE or mean snow covered area in the catchment the ensemble spreads are reduced by two thirds compared to the results of a benchmark simulation based only on runoff for model calibration. Wet snow covered area maps have a high potential for simulating SWE at Weisssee Snow Research Site but introduce additional uncertainties for runoff simulations likely caused by the uncertain detection of the snow covered area from Sentinel-1 backscatter. The approach has high potential for water resources management in gauged and ungauged mountain basin and gives guidance for efficient data assimilation schemes.

TI  - Improving tropospheric corrections on large-scale Sentinel-1 interferograms using a machine learning approach for integration with GNSS-derived zenith total delay (ZTD)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 mission with its wide spatial coverage (250 km), short revisit time (6 days), and rapid data dissemination opened new perspectives for large-scale interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis. However, the spatiotemporal changes in troposphere limits the accuracy of InSAR measurements for operational deformation monitoring at a wide scale. Due to the coarse node spacing of the tropospheric models, like ERA-Interim and other external data like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the interpolation techniques are not able to well replicate the localized and turbulent tropospheric effects. In this study, we propose a new technique based on machine learning (ML) Gaussian processes (GP) regression approach using the combination of small-baseline interferograms and GNSS derived zenith total delay (ZTD) values to mitigate phase delay caused by troposphere in interferometric observations. By applying the ML technique over 12 Sentinel-1 images acquired between May-October 2016 along a track over Norway, the root mean square error (RMSE) reduces on average by 83% compared to 50% reduction obtained by using ERA-Interim model.

TI  - Analysis of Sentinel-3 SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms for deriving temporally consistent water levels over ice-covered lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry has been widely used in the monitoring of water levels of lakes, rivers and wetlands in the past decades. The conventional pulse-limited radar altimeters have a relatively large ground footprint, which limits their capability to retrieve surface elevation information over small and medium-sized water bodies. A new generation of satellite radar altimeter system, a dual-frequency SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, has produced densely sampled elevation measurements with a smaller footprint for the Earth's surfaces since June 2016, owing to the Delay-Doppler processing technique. Four standard SRAL SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms (known as retrackers) have been designed to retrieve elevation measurements for different types of surfaces: Ice-Sheet retracker for polar ice sheets, SAMOSA-3 retracker for open ocean and coastal zones, OCOG retracker for sea-ice margins, and Sea-Ice retracker for sea ice. In this research, we evaluated the performances of the Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry retrackers over lakes, particularly over seasonally ice-covered lakes in one hydrological cycle. For 15 lakes and reservoirs with different sizes and at varying latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we compared the lake water levels estimated by each of standard SRAL SAR retrackers against in-situ water level measurements for different seasons (a full hydrologic cycle) during 2016-2017. Our evaluation shows that Sea-Ice retracker was unable to provide continuous estimates of lake water levels, as a result of the high rate of missing data. Although the precision and relative accuracy of lake water level estimates from these three standard SRAL SAR retrackers are similar, the SAMOSA-3 retracker has the least bias in comparison with ground-based gauge measurements. When the lakes in the mid- and high-latitude regions were covered by ice in the winter season, these three standard SAR retrackers generated erroneous lake water level measurements, significantly lower than the true lake water levels recorded by in-situ gauge stations. The measurement errors of these three standard retrackers increase with the growth of the lake ice thickness. To address the negative effect of the seasonal ice cover, we developed a new bimodal correction algorithm. We demonstrate that our bimodal correction algorithm can retrieve the ice thickness and reliably estimate water levels for the ice-covered lakes in winter, hence enabling the generation of temporally consistent lake water level measurements throughout all seasons for lake hydrological analysis.

TI  - Logging intensity drives variability in carbon stocks in lowland forests in Vietnam
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation in the tropics is generating large carbon (C) emissions. In tropical Asia, logging is the main driver of forest degradation. For effective implementation of REDD+ projects in logged forests in Southeast Asia, the impacts of logging on forest C stocks need to be assessed. Here, we assess C stocks in logged lowland forests in central Vietnam and explore correlations between logging intensity, soil, topography and living aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We present an approach to estimate historical logging intensities for the prevalent situation when complete records on logging history are unavailable. Landsat analysis and participatory mapping were used to quantify the density of historical disturbances, used as a proxy of logging intensities in the area. Carbon in AGC, dead wood, belowground carbon (BGC) and soil (SOC) was measured in twenty-four 0.25 ha plots that vary in logging intensity, and data on recent logging, soil properties, elevation and slope were also collected. Heavily logged forests stored only half the amount of AGC of stems a >= 10 cm dbh as lightly logged forests, mainly due to a reduction in the number of large ( >= 60 cm dbh) trees. Carbon in AGC of small trees (5-10 cm dbh), dead wood and BGC comprised only small fractions of total C stocks, while SOC in the topsoil of 0-30 cm depth stored similar to 50% of total C stocks. Combining logging intensities with soil and topographic data showed that logging intensity was the main factor explaining the variability in AGC. Our research shows large reductions in AGC in medium and heavily logged forests. It highlights the critical importance of conserving big trees to maintain high forest C stocks and accounting for SOC in total C stock estimates.

TI  - The forgotten land use class: Mapping of fallow fields across the Sahel using Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-derived cropland products have depicted the location and extent of agricultural lands with an ever increasing accuracy. However, limited attention has been devoted to distinguishing between actively cropped fields and fallowed fields within agricultural lands, and in particular so in grass fallow systems of semi-arid areas. In the Sahel, one of the largest dryland regions worldwide, crop-fallow rotation practices are widely used for soil fertility regeneration. Yet, little is known about the extent of fallow fields since fallow is not explicitly differentiated within the cropland class in any existing remote sensing-based land use/cover maps, regardless of the spatial scale. With a 10 m spatial resolution and a 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery made it possible to disentangle agricultural land into cropped and fallow fields, facilitated by Google Earth Engine (GEE) for big data handling. Here we produce the first Sahelian fallow field map at a 10 m resolution for the baseline year 2017, accomplished by designing a remote sensing driven protocol for generating reference data for mapping over large areas. Based on the 2015 Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover map at 100 m resolution, the extent of fallow fields in the cropland class is estimated to be 63% (403,617 km(2)) for the Sahel in 2017. Similar results are obtained for five contemporary cropland products, with fallow fields occupying 57-62% of the cropland area. Yet, it is noted that the total estimated area coverage depends on the quality of the different cropland products. The share of cropped fields within the Copernicus cropland area is found to be higher in the arid regions (200-300 mm rainfall) as compared to the semi-arid regions (300-600 mm rainfall). The woody cover fraction within cropped and fallow fields is found to have a reversed pattern between arid (higher woody cover in cropped fields) and semi-arid (higher woody cover in fallow fields) regions. The method developed, using cloud-based Earth Observation (EO) data and computation on the GEE platform, is expected to be reproducible for mapping the extent of fallow fields across global croplands. Future applications based on multi-year time series is expected to improve our understanding of crop-fallow rotation dynamics in grass fallow systems being key in teasing apart how cropland intensification and expansion affect environmental variables, such as soil fertility, crop yields and local livelihoods in low-income regions such as the Sahel.

TI  - Tumor Response After Neoadjuvant Magnetic Resonance Guided Single Ablative Dose Partial Breast Irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess the pathologic and radiologic response in patients with low-risk breast cancer treated with magnetic resonance (MR) guided neoadjuvant partial breast irradiation (NA-PBI) and to evaluate toxicity and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).Methods and Materials: For this single-arm prospective trial, women with unifocal, non-lobular tumors with a maximum diameter of 20 mm (age, 50-70 years) or 30 mm (age, >= 70 years) and tumor-negative sentinel node(s) were eligible. Patients were treated with a single ablative dose of NA-PBI followed by breast-conserving surgery after an interval of 6 to 8 months. Target volumes were defined on radiation therapy planning computed tomography scan and additional magnetic resonance imaging. Prescribed doses to gross tumor volume and clinical target volume (gross tumor volume plus 20 mm margin) were 20 Gy and 15 Gy, respectively. Primary outcome was pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary outcomes were radiologic response (on magnetic resonance imaging), toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), PROs (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-BR23, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and cosmesis (assessed by patient, radiation oncologist, and BCCT.core software).Results: Thirty-six patients were treated with NA-PBI, and pCR was reported in 15 patients (42%; 95% confidence interval, 26%-59%). Radiologic complete response was observed in 15 patients, 10 of whom had pCR (positive predictive value, 67%; 95% confidence interval, 39%-87%). After a median follow-up of 21 months (range, 12-41), all patients experienced grade 1 fibrosis in the treated breast volume. Transient grade 2 and 3 toxicity was observed in 31% and 3% of patients, respectively. Local recurrences were absent. No deterioration in PROs or cosmetic results was observed.Conclusions: NA-PBI has the potential to induce pCR in a substantial proportion of patients, with acceptable toxicity. This treatment seems a feasible alternative to standard postoperative irradiation and could even result in postponement or omission of surgery if pCR can be accurately predicted in selected low-risk patients.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring on Spatial Differentiation of Suspended Sediment Concentration in a River-Lake System Based on Sentinel-2 MSI Imaging:A Case for Shengjin Lake and Connected Yangtze River Section in Anhui Province
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Carrying out monitoring of suspended sediment concentration in river and lake systems is of great significance for understanding the laws of sediment transport in water and formulating policies on water environmental control. Taking Shengjin Lake and the connected Yangtze river section in Anhui province as the study area, band reflectance of a Sentinel-2 MSI sensor is simulated according to field spectral datasets, and the retrieval model is established by statistical regression from the synchronized suspended sediment concentration measurements. Then, the retrieved results from 28 scene MSI images during 2017-2019 are used to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of suspended sediment concentration in rivers and lakes, and the influence of water level variation on their spatial differentiation is also discussed. The results show that: (1) The retrieval model established by the ratio of the sixth band to the third band of the MSI sensor is suitable for high-turbidity water type, with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.863, RMSE = 22.211 mg.L-1). (2) Spatially, the suspended sediment concentration near the lake entrances, northwestern parts of the upper and middle lake areas, and the lower lake is relatively higher, and that of Shengjin Lake is lower than that of the Yangtze River overall except for in summer. Temporally, the suspended sediment concentration in Shengjin Lake is relatively lower in summer and higher in other seasons, while the connected Yangtze River section exhibits the opposite intra-annual variation. (3) The water level, which is caused by the connectivity of rivers and lakes under the influence of the sluice, is the key factor affecting the spatial differentiation of suspended sediment concentration in the river and lake system. The suspended sediment concentration in Shengjin Lake contributes to the Yangtze River in dry and normal water periods, and that in the normal water period is more significant. In contrast, during the flood period, the correlation between suspended sediment concentration in the Yangtze River and that in Shengjin Lake is not obvious.

TI  - Thin cloud detection over land using background surface reflectance based on the BRDF model applied to Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data sets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) sensor onboard the COMS (Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite) launched in 2010 was primarily designed to provide high-frequency observations in and around the Korean Peninsula to ensure the thorough monitoring of ocean properties. Owing to its pixel resolution of 500 m and large set of spectral solar channels, GOCI can also be considered for applications related to the characterization of vegetation and the retrieval of aerosol properties over land. However, to apply it for the full characterization of land, it is mandatory to properly remove clouds from the images. Such a procedure has limitations when there is a lack of thermal bands, as is the case with GOCI. However, GOCI data are impacted by shadows and radiation scattering effects during the daily course of the sun. Although this yields strong directional effects, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) can be determined to a high level of accuracy. This information is used as a reference to detect clouds over land because surface BRDF varies slowly with time compared to that of clouds. The proposed algorithm relies on knowledge of the BRDF field derived from the application of a semi-empirical model that simulates the minimum difference between top and bottom of atmosphere reflectance values as the baseline of clear atmosphere. This step also serves to estimate background surface reflectance underneath clouds. Accuracy assessment of the new GOCI cloud mask product is appraised through a comparison with high-resolution vertical profiles of lidar data from the polar orbiting Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). The results for the Probability Of Detection (POD) of all cloud types was found to be 0.831 for GOCI; this is comparable to that of MODIS (0.772). For the case of only thin cirrus, GOCI POD value was assessed to be 0.849, similar to that of MODIS, underlining the improved efficiency of determining thin cloud pixels.

TI  - Soil moisture assessment through the SSMMI and GSSIM algorithm based on SPOT, WorldView-2, and Sentinel-2 images in the Daliuta Coal Mining Area, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A set of indicators that focus only on numerical values is constructed based on remotely sensed images to assess soil moisture conditions. The quantitative evaluation of soil moisture variation in two periods is rarely referred to in the current literature. In this study, a scaled soil moisture monitoring index (SSMMI) was established to monitor the soil moisture status during 2010-2018 in the Daliuta Coal Mining Area (DCMA), China, based on SPOT-5, SPOT-6, and Sentinel-2 images. We also employed a gradient-based structural similarity (GSSIM) algorithm to quantitatively analyze the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the soil moisture in the DCMA. The optimal scale for exploring the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture was determined by local variance and semivariance methods. The results showed that the soil moisture decreased at a rate of 0.0213/a from 2010 to 2018. The areas with the extremely dry and dry levels, which were mainly located in the northwest, some regions of the central area, and the southeast of the DCMA, decreased from 14.48% in 2010 to 13.66% in 2018. The proportion of the no dry level was improved by 14.62%, while the area of the extremely wet and wet levels decreased by 13.79%. The mean value of the soil moisture in the unmined area was greater than that in the DCMA, which was larger than that in the mined area. The result of the GSSIM analysis indicated that the area of dramatic change, where the soil moisture changed substantially, was chiefly distributed in the north, west, some central regions, and some parts of the south and east of the DCMA. The region where the substantial change occurred was surrounded by a moderate-change area, which was encompassed by a low-change area. The area with dramatic and moderate decreases in the soil moisture accounted for 64.52% of the region, which was greater than that with incremental soil moisture changes, which accounted for 5.85% of the region. The area also showed decreased soil moisture from 2010 to 2018. Soil moisture changes are closely related to variations in land cover. For instance, vegetative cover over an open-pit mining area can cause a dramatic reduction in soil moisture. Ninety-three meters was the optimal scale used for monitoring the soil moisture in the DCMA, which indicates that we can adopt the SPOT-5, SPOT-6, and Sentinel-2 images to evaluate the soil moisture conditions in the DCMA.

TI  - A robust spectral-spatial approach to identifying heterogeneous crops using remote sensing imagery with high spectral and spatial resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneous crop identification has been the subject of much concern, since smallholder farms less than 1 ha are the main agricultural form in many areas, especially China. Remote sensing with high spectral and spatial resolutions via aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a potential alternative technique for the monitoring of heterogeneous crops in smallholder agriculture. Although this new type of remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions provides the possibility of fine classification, it also brings some challenges, such as bands contaminated with severe noise, the nonuniform distribution of the discriminative spectral information, and the spectral variability of crops. In this study, we attempted to resolve these problems by developing a robust spectral-spatial agricultural crop mapping method based on conditional random fields (SCRF), which learns the sensitive spectral information of the crops by a spectrally weighted kernel, and uses the spatial interaction of pixels to improve the classification performance. Data from a manned aircraft platform and a UAV platform were chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively use the relative utility of each spectral band to detect the bands contaminated with severe noise, and it uses the spectrally weighted kernel to consider the sensitive spectral information of the crops. The algorithm with only a spectrally weighted kernel showed an improvement of more than 4% over the classical support vector machine and random forest methods. Moreover, the spatial information was proved to be of crucial importance for crop classification, and both the object-oriented method and the proposed SCRF method can improve the classification performance in terms of both visualization and the quantitative metrics by considering the spatial information. Compared with the object-oriented method, SCRF can deliver a better classification performance, with an accuracy improvement of more than 2%.

TI  - Kalman filter method for generating time-series synthetic Landsat images and their uncertainty from Landsat and MODIS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat program, since its commencement in 1972, has acquired millions of images of our planet. Those images are one of the most valuable Earth Observation resources for local, regional and global land surface monitoring and study due to their moderate spatial resolution and rich spectral information. However, their applications are impeded largely by their relatively low revisit frequency and cloud contamination on images. In order to improve their usability, a number of studies have been conducted to blend Landsat images with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to take merits of the two sensors. All blending models reported that they can predict synthetic Landsat images with various degrees of accuracy. However, only a couple of models reported that they can explicitly estimate uncertainty for their blended images.In this study, we propose a new surface reflectance blending model based on a Kalman Filter algorithm (Kalman Filter Reflectance Fusion Model - KFRFM) to predict time-series synthetic Landsat images from Landsat and MODIS images, and simultaneously to estimate uncertainty of the predicted synthetic images to quantify the quality of the synthetic images. Using the model, we predicted a time-series of 38 synthetic Landsat images with a temporal interval of 4 days for a vegetation growing season spanning about 6 months from Nadir Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function adjusted MODIS product (MCD43A4), and their corresponding uncertainties. From this time-series, we calculated five vegetation indices involving all the spectral bands of the synthetic images, and compared them to those from Landsat observations. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to produce high quality synthetic Landsat images to meet various application demands for higher spatial and temporal resolution images. Uncertainty analysis reveals that cropland has the largest uncertainty followed by grassland while forests have the smallest uncertainties among the seven vegetation land cover types of the study area. For performance evaluation, we compared KFRFM to several published models. The comparison results reveal that KFRFM performs the best based on the assessed image quality indices.

TI  - Enriching the intersection of service and transformative learning with Freirean ideas: The case of a critical experiential learning programme in Brazil
T2  - MANAGEMENT LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we examine the value of combining transformative and service learning pedagogical practices in management education programmes to encourage management students to be more critical and reflexive regarding serious contemporary issues like social inequality and sustainability. We draw on a long-term management education experience conducted in the northeastern region of Brazil, where international students learn how to develop a real-time community-based project with local inhabitants. We argue that while service learning approaches promote pragmatic action-based principles, transformative learning acts at the epistemic level, contributing to change in values. In addition, Paulo Freire's ideas are integrated to reinforce critical and reflexive dimensions of the learning experience. Our results offer a process-based model showing how a critical experiential learning pedagogy might lead to the development of community-based competences, which, in turn, might lead to changes in the deeply held values of the participants. Freire's emancipatory ideas are applied not only regarding the relationship between teachers and students, but also to the distinction between Western and non-Western societies, going beyond questioning of the destructive consequences of financial capitalism to question the hegemony of one worldview over all other possible ones.

TI  - Deep learning-based water quality estimation and anomaly detection using Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 virtual constellation and cloud computing
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of inland water quality is of significant importance due to the increase in water quality related issues, especially within the Midwestern United States. Traditional monitoring techniques, although highly accurate, are vastly insufficient in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. Using a virtual constellation by harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data a high temporal frequency dataset can be created at a relatively fine spatial scale. In this study, we apply a novel deep learning method for the estimation of blue-green algae (BGA), chlorophyll-alpha (Chl), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance (SC), and turbidity. The developed model is evaluated against previously studied machine learning methods and found to outperform multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and extreme learning machine regression (ELR) generating R-2 of 0.91 for BGA, 0.88, 0.89, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.84 for Chl, DO, SC, and turbidity respectfully. This model is then applied to all available data ranging from 2013-2018 and time series for each variable were generated for four selected waterbodies. We then use the Empirical Data Analytics (EDA) anomaly detection method on the time series to identify abnormal data points. Upon further analysis, the EDA method successfully identifies abnormal events in water quality. Our results also demonstrate strong correlation between non-optically active variables such as SC with Chl and fDOM. The framework developed in this study represents an efficient and accurate empirical method for inland water quality monitoring at the regional scale.

AB  - On-site monitoring in large areas located in inaccessible regions can be difficult and costly. Thus remote sensing is an essential tool for mapping and monitoring changes in such regions. Therefore, this paper describes long-term multisensory satellite observations of the expansion of the Batagaika crater in Northern Siberia and natural succession of vegetation in its interior from 1991 to 2018. Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 + ETM, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imageries were mainly used as a data source for analyses, although Sentinel-2A imagery and DEM image from ASTER satellite were also employed for calculating a vegetation index and expansion in the crater area. The observations were conducted in years 1991-2018 and were made in a summer season. The results reveal that the crater area increased by almost three times during these 27 years and that the fastest expansion took place between 2010 and 2014 with 22.7% increment. The analysis of elevation of the crater revealed that in 2018 its maximum depth was ca 70 m and that depth was decreasing towards its north-east tail. Additionally, the satellite imagery of land surface temperature which is a driving force of crater expansion was visualized for chosen hot days within the time frame 2010-2018. The study of temporal and spatial changes in NDVI spatial distributions inside the crater revealed also a high rate of the succession of vegetation, which may reduce melting of permafrost inside the Batagaika crater and its further expansion.

T2  - CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay analyzes how far-right paratexts enunciate and circulate frameworks of interpretation that situate the film, Black Panther, as a Trumpian homage. Such rubrics travel through an interconnected media ecosystem and use the film to promote the views of the far-right, adoration for Donald Trump, and a postracial, neoliberal worldview. Analysis of these paratexts demonstrates how white supremacy relies on a wealth of circulated logics that can be deployed thru novel texts and considers the implications of contemporary media environments for ideological formations.

TI  - Diverse sample generation with multi-branch conditional generative adversarial network for remote sensing objects detection
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing data is difficult to collect and lack of diversity, which extremely limits the performance of object detection on remote sensing images. In this paper, a multi-branch conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is proposed to augment data for object detection in optical remote sensing images, which is the first GANs-based data augmentation framework proposed for this topic. We use MCGAN to generate the diverse objects based on the existing remote sensing datasets. The multi-branch dilated convolution and the classification branch are adopted into MCGAN to help the generator to generate the diverse and high-quality images. Meanwhile, an adaptive samples selection strategy based on the Faster R-CNN is proposed to select the samples for data augmentation from the objects generated by MCGAN, which can ensure the quality of new augmented training sets and improve the diversity of samples. Experiments based on NWPU VHR-10 and DOTA show that the objects generated by MCGAN have the higher quality compared with the objects generated by WGAN and LSGAN. And the mean average precision detected by the state-of-the-art object detection models used in the experiments has the satisfactory improvement after the MCGAN based data augmentation, which indicates that data augmentation by MCGAN can effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing images object detection.

TI  - The hazardous 2017-2019 surge and river damming by Shispare Glacier, Karakoram
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017-2019 a surge of Shispare Glacier, a former tributary of the once larger Hasanabad Glacier (Hunza region), dammed the proglacial river of Muchuhar Glacier, which formed an ice-dammed lake and generated a small Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Surge movement produced the highest recorded Karakoram glacier surface flow rate using feature tracking (similar to 18 +/- 0.5 m d(-1)) and resulted in a glacier frontal advance of 1495 +/- 47 m. The surge speed was less than reports of earlier Hasanabad advances during 1892/93 (9.3 km) and 1903 (9.7 km). Surges also occurred in 1973 and 2000-2001. Recent surges and lake evolution are examined using feature tracking in satellite images (1990-2019), DEM differencing (1973-2019), and thermal satellite data (2000-2019). The recent active phase of Shispare surge began in April 2018, showed two surface flow maxima in June 2018 and May 2019, and terminated following a GLOF on 22-23 June 2019. The surge likely had hydrological controls influenced in winter by compromised subglacial flow and low meltwater production. It terminated during summer probably because increased meltwater restored efficient channelized flow. We also identify considerable heterogeneity of movement, including spring/summer accelerations.

TI  - Analyzing multi-year rice-fallow dynamics in Odisha using multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable intensification of existing cropland is one of the most viable options for meeting the escalating food demands of the ever-increasing population in the world. Accurate geospatial data about the potential single-crop (rice-fallows) areas is vital for policymakers to target the agro-technologies for enhancing crop productivity and intensification. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate and understand the dynamics of rice-fallows in the Odisha state of India, using SAR (Sentinel-1) and Optical (Landsat OLI) datasets. This study utilized a decision-tree approach and Principal component analysis (PCA) for the segmentation and separation of different vegetation classes. The estimated overall accuracy of extracted rice-fallow maps was in the range of 84 to 85 percent. The study identified about 2.2, 2.0 and 2.1mha of Rice-Fallows in the years 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18, respectively. The combined analysis (all three years) of rice-fallow maps identified about 1.34mha of permanent rice-fallows, whereas the remaining 0.6-0.8mha area was under the current-fallow category. About 50% of the total permanent rice-fallows were detected in the rainfed areas of Mayurbhanj, Bhadrak, Bolangir, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Baleswar, Nawarangpur and Bargarh districts. The study also illustrated the time-series profiles of SMAP (soil moisture) datasets for the ten agroclimatic zones of the Odisha, which can be utilized (along with rice-fallow maps) for the selection of crop and cultivars (e.g. short or medium duration pulses or oilseeds) to target the rice fallows. The approach utilized in the current study can be scaled up in similar areas of South and South-east Asia and Africa to identify single-crop areas for targeting improved technologies for enhanced crop productivity and intensification.

TI  - Land cover change, landscape degradation, and restoration along a railway line in the Amazon biome, Brazil
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Railways are known to have less influence on land use than other transportation systems. However, railways also affect biodiversity, water resources, socioeconomic outcomes, and land prices. In the context of changes in land cover and land use (LCLU) classes, this study analyses the changes arising from the establishment of the Carajas Mining Project in 1984 along the more than 900-km length of the Carajas Railway (CRW) in southeastern Amazonia. LANDSAT-5 (1984) and LANDSAT-8 (2014) satellite images and human settlement layers (1990 and 2015) along CRW were used to assess LCLU changes. Satellite images were analysed with the geographic object-based image analysis method to detect changes in LCLU classes, including municipalities located less than 50 km from the CRW. The results showed that in 1984, the areas of influence of the CRW consisted of 69% forest cover, 24% nonforest cover, 3% water, and 2% cloud cover. In 2014, forest area dropped significantly to 43%, whereas the nonforest class expanded to 46%. This analysis revealed that the conversion of forests to pastures represents the major landscape degradation that occupy 51% of the study site mainly in rural human settlement areas, which are interlinked with the construction of the CRW. Only 6% of the total area exhibits a trend of restoration marked by secondary vegetation growing. The land occupation model along the CRW is characterized by rural settlements, associated with roads and extensive pasturelands. Construction of this railway in a certain way prevented the fishbone occupation type as observed in the western Amazon.

TI  - Pine plantations and five decades of land use change in central Chile
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of forest plantations is cause for concern because of their environmental effects, and the loss of native forests and agricultural land. Our goal was to quantify the increase in pine plantation, and concomitant loss of native forests, in central Chile since ca. 1960, and to identify in which settings native forests were lost most rapidly. We analyzed aerial photographs from 1955 and 1961, Landsat images from 1975 and 1998, and Google Earth high-resolution satellite images from 2014. To ensure high classification accuracy, we visually interpreted images for a systematic 3-km grid and assigned each point as either 'pine plantation', 'native forest', 'agricultural-livestock lands', or 'other'. We also calculated latitude, longitude, slope, Euclidean distance to the nearest road and to the nearest pulp mill, and the frequency of land use surrounding each point as potential variables to explain observed land use changes. Pine plantations expansion started even before 1960, when 12% of all points were already pine plantations, was particularly rapid from 1975 (18% of sample points) to 1998 (38%), and stabilized thereafter (37% by 2014). From 1975 to 1998 alone, 40% of native forests were replaced by pine plantations, and agricultural-livestock lands declined by 0.7%, 0.9%, 1% per year before 1975, from 1975 to 1998, and after 1998 respectively. Native forests that were surrounded by pine plantations, were most likely to be converted to plantations, and from 1960 to 1975, also native forests near pulp mills. The probability of change from agricultural-livestock lands to pine plantations was mainly influenced by slope, with most agricultural-livestock lands remaining in areas with low slopes.

TI  - Awareness of HIV-positive status and linkage to treatment prior to pregnancy in the "test and treat" era: A national antenatal sentinel survey, 2017, South Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionKnowledge of HIV status in South Africa (SA) is reported to be 90% among people living with HIV. National level estimates could mask population-specific levels, which are critical to monitor program coverage and potential impact. Using data from the 2017 national antenatal sentinel survey, we assessed knowledge of HIV-positive status, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and socio-demographic characteristics associated with knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy among women attending antenatal care.MethodsBetween 1 October and 15 November 2017, a nationally representative sample of 32,716 pregnant women were enrolled from 1,595 public health facilities selected from all districts of SA. Data on age, gravidity, knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART initiation prior to pregnancy were extracted from medical records. A blood sample was collected from each woman regardless of prior knowledge of HIV status or ART history, and tested for HIV in the laboratory. All HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled in the survey were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Multivariable survey logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with knowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy.ResultsOf 10,065 eligible HIV-positive women, 60.8% (95% confidence interval (CI):59.9%-61.7%) knew their HIV status prior to the current pregnancy, of whom 91.1% (95% CI: 90.4%-91.7%) initiated ART prior to the current pregnancy. Knowledge of HIV-positive status was lower among adolescent girls and young women (15-24 years) (38.9%) and primigravid women (40.5%) compared with older women (35-49 years) (75.5%) and multigravid women (64.7%). In a multivariable analysis, significant effect modification was found between gravidity and age (P value = 0.047). Being in the age group 15-24 years compared to the age group 35-49 years decreased the odds of knowing HIV-positive status by 80% (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.2, 95% CI:0.1-0.4) among primigravid women and by 60%(AOR: 0.4, 95% CI:0.3-0.4) among multigravid women.ConclusionKnowledge of HIV-positive status prior to the current pregnancy fell short of the target of 90% among pregnant women living with HIV. This was especially low among adolescent girls and young women, highlighting the gap in youth friendly reproductive health and HIV testing services.

TI  - Interplay between topography, fog and vegetation in the central South Arabian mountains revealed using a novel Landsat fog detection technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the central South Arabian mountains of Yemen and Oman, monsoon fog interception by the endemic cloud forest is essential for ecosystem functions and services. Yet, we know little about the local factors affecting fog distributions and their cumulative effects on vegetation. To examine these relationships, we developed a novel method of high-resolution fog detection using Landsat data, and validated the results using occurrence records of eight moisture-sensitive plant species. Regression tree analysis was then used to examine the topographic factors influencing fog distributions and the topoclimatic factors influencing satellite-derived vegetation greenness. We find that the interplay between the complex mountain topography and the incoming fog results in heterogeneous fog densities. Specifically, fog accumulates against steep windward slopes and landforms, resulting in hotspots of fog interception, while lower fog densities occur in leeward locations. We also find that fog distributions correlate with patterns of vegetation greenness, and overall, that greenness increases with fog density. The layer of fog density describes patterns of vegetation greenness more accurately than topographic variables alone, and thus, we propose that regional vegetation patterns more closely follow a fog gradient, than an altitudinal gradient as previously supposed. The layer of fog density will enable an improved understanding of how species and communities, many of which are endemic, range-restricted and in decline, respond to local variability in topoclimatic conditions.

TI  - Is the RdNBR a better estimator of wildfire burn severity than the dNBR? A discussion and case study in southeast China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing number of wildfires around the world have been resulting in severe post-fire effects. Understanding the accurate distribution of the wildfire burn severity is particularly important for post-fire management. The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and its relative dNBR (RdNBR) are the two main indices for burn severity assessment. In China, little information is available on the capabilities of the dNBR and RdNBR for the burn severity assessment. Moreover, differing results of the detection capabilities of the dNBR and RdNBR for the burn severity have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to assess the potential of the dNBR and RdNBR for the wildfire burn severity estimation in southeast China to influence the post-fire management. Landsat satellite imageries on 15 August 2017 (pre-fire) and 15 August 2019 (post-fire) and field-based burn severity surveys were used to develop effective burn severity models using regression methods. The results showed that the dNBR is a better and more reliable index for burn severity mapping than the RdNBR. Using the RdNBR to estimate burn severity likely leads to an underestimation. RdNBR was designed to normalize for variations in pre-fire vegetation and therefore should most useful in heterogenous landscapes, such as the field area, which has areas of grassland and areas of forest. However, we found the opposite pattern: for predicting burn severity, the dNBR resulted in higher R-2 and smaller RMSE values than the RdNBR for forested areas alone, and for combined forested and grassland areas (i.e. the entire field area). For grassland areas alone, the dNBR had similar R-2 and RMSE to that of the RdNBR. In brief, the inconsistent results of the detection capabilities of the dNBR and RdNBR for burn severity around the world are closely related to diverse local conditions. The RdNBR must be used with caution in estimating the burn severity at a specific site. Our study enriches the knowledge of the wildfire burn severity assessment in the southeast coast of China.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes illnesses among all age groups and presents a burden to healthcare services. To better understand the epidemiology and seasonality of RSV in different geographical areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated a pilot initiative to access the feasibility of establishing RSV surveillance using the existing Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) platform. Objectives To describe and compare RSV and influenza seasonality in countries in the northern andsouthern temperate, and tropics during the period January 2017 to April 2019. Methods Fourteen countries in six WHO regions participating in the GISRS were invited for the pilot. Hospitalized patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), SARI without fever and outpatients presenting with acute respiratory illness (ARI) were enrolled from January 2017 to April 2019. The expected minimum sample size was 20 samples per week, year-round, per country. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect RSV and influenza viruses.Results were uploaded to the WHO FluMart platform. Results Annual seasonality of RSV was observed in all countries, which overlapped to a large extent with the influenza activity. In countries, in temperate regions RSV peaked in the autumn/winter months. In Egypt, a subtropical country, RSV activity peaked in the cooler season. In the tropical regions, RSV peaked during the rainy seasons. Conclusion Early findings from the WHO RSV surveillance pilot based on the GISRS suggest annual seasonal patterns for of RSV circulation that overlap with influenza. RSV surveillance needs to be continued for several more seasons to establish seasonality patterns to inform prevention and control strategies.

TI  - Brief communication: Evaluation of the near-surface climate in ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ERA5 reanalysis, recently made available by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is a new reanalysis product at a high resolution replacing ERA-Interim and is considered to provide the best climate reanalysis over Greenland to date. However, so far little is known about the performance of ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). In this study, we compare the near-surface climate from the new ERA5 reanalysis to ERA-Interim, the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) as well as to a state-of-the-art polar regional climate model (MAR). The results show (1) that ERA5 does not outperform ERA-Interim significantly when compared with near-surface climate observations over GrIS, but ASR better models the near-surface temperature than both ERA reanalyses. (2) Polar regional climate models (e.g., MAR) are still a useful tool to downscale the GrIS climate compared to ERA5, as in particular the near-surface temperature in summer has a key role for representing snow and ice processes such as the surface melt. However, assimilating satellite data and using a more recent radiative scheme enable both ERA and ASR reanalyses to represent more satisfactorily than MAR the downward solar and infrared fluxes. (3) MAR near-surface climate is not affected when forced at its lateral boundaries by either ERA5 or ERA-Interim. Therefore, forcing polar regional climate models with ERA5 starting from 1950 will enable long and homogeneous surface mass balance reconstructions.

TI  - Assimilation of SEVIRI Water Vapor Channels With an Ensemble Kalman Filter on the Convective Scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems at the convective scale are operated to gain reliable forecasts for diverse atmospheric variables at high spatial resolution. Especially for the prediction of small-scale weather phenomena such as deep convection including the associated precipitation patterns and wind gusts the high-resolution models provide additional benefit over coarser scale models. In this context the distribution of atmospheric humidity plays an important role, however conventional observations of atmospheric humidity are sparse in space and time. The present work aims at the assimilation of water vapor channel radiances of the satellite instrument SEVIRI in an operational framework based on a Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) and a convection permitting NWP model. This article describes all the essential elements for a successful incorporation of this kind of data into the system, from the application of a cloud filtering technique over bias correction and vertical localization of the radiance observation. Data assimilation experiments over two 4-week periods show a neutral to slightly positive impact of SEVIRI radiances on upper-air relative humidity and wind speed forecasts.

TI  - Worldview-based hospitality brand support: belief in a just world theory perspectives
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeDespite the well-established branding literature, how a brand is connected to individual, market and societal/ideological levels are largely unknown. Grounded in the belief in a just world (BJW) theory, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of brand positioning status (BPS) on the support of certain brands (financially and non-financially) and examine the moderating roles of brand ideology and protestant work ethic (PWE).Design/methodology/approachIn Study 1, a 2 (BPS: topdog vs underdog) x 2 (brand ideology: universalism vs power) between-subjects experimental design is conducted on overall brand support, purchase intention and word-of-mouth. To build upon the findings, Study 2 explores the three-way interaction effects on the same dependent variables by using a 2 (BPS: topdog vs underdog) x 2 (ideology: universalism vs power) x 2 (PWE: high vs low) quasi-experimental between-subjects design study.FindingsThe results of these studies reveal that customers have a strong intention to support the brands with universalism values, regardless of BPS, as power imbalance in the marketplace is not as salient. When a brand conveys the power ideology, the BPS greatly matters in earning customers' support. This tendency, however, is varied among customers based on their level of PWE. This is because customers' justification and evaluation on capitalism differs and their views toward market competitions between topdogs and underdogs are influenced by the personal worldviews.Originality/valueThe findings build upon belief in a just world theory and branding literature and discuss the importance of considering the BPS and the ideology a brand conveys in the marketplace, as the meanings and messages could be perceived differently based on what kind of work ethic one possesses and supports.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-1 radar observations to evaluate snowmelt dynamics in alpine regions
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the timing and the evolution of the snow melting process is very important, since it allows the prediction of (i) the snowmelt onset, (ii) the snow gliding and wet-snow avalanches, (iii) the release of snow contaminants, and (iv) the runoff onset. The snowmelt can be monitored by jointly measuring snowpack parameters such as the snow water equivalent (SWE) or the amount of free liquid water content (LWC). However, continuous measurements of SWE and LWC are rare and difficult to obtain. On the other hand, active microwave sensors such as the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mounted on board satellites are highly sensitive to LWC of the snowpack and can provide spatially distributed information with a high resolution. Moreover, with the introduction of Sentinel-1, SAR images are regularly acquired every 6 d over several places in the world. In this paper we analyze the correlation between the multitemporal SAR backscattering and the snowmelt dynamics We compared Sentinel-1 backscattering with snow properties derived from in situ observations and process-based snow modeling simulations for five alpine test sites in Italy, Germany and Switzerland considering 2 hydrological years. We found that the multitemporal SAR measurements allow the identification of the three melting phases that characterize the melting process, i.e., moistening, ripening and runoff. In particular, we found that the C-band SAR backscattering decreases as soon as the snow starts containing water and that the backscattering increases as soon as SWE starts decreasing, which corresponds to the release of meltwater from the snowpack. We discuss the possible reasons of this increase, which are not directly correlated to the SWE decrease but to the different snow conditions, which change the backscattering mechanisms. Finally, we show a spatially distributed application of the identification of the runoff onset from SAR images for a mountain catchment, i.e., the Zugspitze catchment in Germany. Results allow us to better understand the spatial and temporal evolution of melting dynamics in mountain regions. The presented investigation could have relevant applications for monitoring and predicting the snowmelt progress over large regions.

TI  - Employing a value-belief-norm framework to gauge Carthage residents' intentions to support sustainable cultural heritage tourism
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the recent conflicts in Carthage over land use, cultural heritage preservation, and sustainable tourism, this work utilized a value-belief-norm (VBN) theoretical framework to consider psychological antecedents of residents' behavioral intentions to support cultural heritage tourism. As such, personal values, cultural worldview, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, and subjective norms were considered antecedents of intentions to support cultural heritage tourism. Data were collected from 475 Carthage residents in nine neighborhoods adjacent to UNESCO World Heritage Sites using an on-site self-administered questionnaire. The proposed model was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (to demonstrate sound psychometric properties across all 11 factors within the model), followed by structural equation modelling. Overall, 15 of the 19 proposed hypotheses were supported, ultimately contributing to 28% of the variance explained in residents' behavioral intentions to support cultural heritage tourism. This work not only provides support for the utilization of the VBN model within the context of cultural heritage tourism, it also deepens our understanding of the theoretical framework through the inclusion of the multi-dimensional construct cultural worldview.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass using Landsat 8 OLI satellite image in pure Crimean pine (<i>Pinus nigra</i> JF Arnold subsp. <i>pallasiana</i> (Lamb.) Holmboe) stands: a case from Turkey
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite image in Arac Forest Enterprise. The ground data obtained from ground measurements in 317 sample plots were used to accomplish this purpose. The AGB for each sample plot was calculated using this data. The original band brightness, vegetation indices and texture feature values of each sample plot were calculated from the coordinate values of each sample area that were transferred to the Landsat 8 OLI satellite image. The relationships between the AGB with the original band brightness, vegetation indices and texture features values generated from Landsat 8 OLI satellite image were determined by multiple regression analysis. The results revealed that the AGB model using Band2, Band4, Band6 and Band11 had an adjusted coefficient of determination (), of 0.445,37.1738 ton/ha(-1), the AGB model using FII, DVI, EVI and IPVI vegetation indices had an adjusted of 0.387,=39.4221 ton/ha(-1), the AGB model using Band1_5x5_COR, Band3_3x3_COR, Band3_9x9_COR, Band4_3x3_M, Band7_5x5_V, Band7_9x9_COR, Band8_7x7_COR, Band10_9x9_HOM, Band11_3x3_COR, Band11_5x5_M and Band11_7x7_COR had an adjusted of 0.552, = 33.7669 ton/ha(-1). In conclusion, the texture features values were better for the prediction of AGB by using the Landsat 8 OLI satellite image.

TI  - Daily GRACE satellite data evaluate short-term hydro-meteorological fluxes from global atmospheric reanalyses
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in terrestrial water storage as observed by the satellite gravity mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) represent a new and completely independent way to constrain the net flux imbalance in atmospheric reanalyses. In this study daily GRACE gravity field changes are used for the first time to investigate high-frequency hydro-meteorological fluxes over the continents. Band-pass filtered water fluxes are derived from GRACE water storage time series by first applying a numerical differentiation filter and subsequent high-pass filtering to isolate fluxes at periods between 5 and 30 days corresponding to typical time-scales of weather system persistence at moderate latitudes. By comparison with the latest atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) we show that daily GRACE gravity field models contain realistic high-frequency water flux information. Furthermore, GRACE-derived water fluxes can clearly identify improvements realized within ERA5 over its direct predecessor ERA-Interim particularly in equatorial and temperate climate zones. The documented improvements are in good agreement with rain gauge validation, but GRACE also identifies three distinct regions (Sahel Zone, Okavango Catchment, Kimberley Plateau) with a slight degradation of net-fluxes in ERA5 with respect to ERA-Interim, thereby highlighting the potentially added value of non-standard daily GRACE gravity series for hydro-meteorological monitoring purposes.

TI  - Kelp forests at the end of the earth: 45 years later
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The kelp forests of southern South America are some of the least disturbed on the planet. The remoteness of this region has, until recently, spared it from many of the direct anthropogenic stressors that have negatively affected these ecosystems elsewhere. Re-surveys of 11 locations at the easternmost extent of Tierra del Fuego originally conducted in 1973 showed no significant differences in the densities of adult and juvenile Macrocystis pyrifera kelp or kelp holdfast diameter between the two survey periods. Additionally, sea urchin assemblage structure at the same sites were not significantly different between the two time periods, with the dominant species Loxechinus albus accounting for 66.3% of total sea urchin abundance in 2018 and 61.1% in 1973. Time series of Landsat imagery of the region from 1998 to 2018 showed no long-term trends in kelp canopy over the past 20 years. However, similar to 4-year oscillations in canopy fraction were observed and were strongly and negatively correlated with the NOAA Multivariate ENSO index and sea surface temperature. More extensive surveying in 2018 showed significant differences in benthic community structure between exposed and sheltered locations. Fish species endemic to the Magellanic Province accounted for 73% of all nearshore species observed and from 98-100% of the numerical abundance enumerated at sites. Fish assemblage structure varied significantly among locations and wave exposures. The recent creation of the Yaganes Marine Park is an important step in protecting this unique and biologically rich region; however, the nearshore waters of the region are currently not included in this protection. There is a general lack of information on changes in kelp forests over long time periods, making a global assessment difficult. A complete picture of how these ecosystems are responding to human pressures must also include remote locations and locations with little to no impact.

TI  - Synergistic use of particle swarm optimization, artificial neural network, and extreme gradient boosting algorithms for urban LULC mapping from WorldView-3 images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) has emerged as an effective and evolving paradigm for analyzing very high resolution (VHR) images as it demonstrates preeminence over the traditional pixel-wise methods and enables the utilization of diverse spectral, geometrical, and textural information to for image classification. Among feature selection (FS) methods, metaheuristic FS techniques have recently demonstrated effective performance in the dimensionality reduction of GEOBIA features. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) was integrated with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to enhance the learning process and more effectively determine the most significant features and their importance using WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data. First, multi-resolution image segmentation parameters were tuned using Taguchi optimization technique and unsupervised segmentation quality measure. Second, the proposed ANN-PSO was compared with PSO under 100 iterations. The ANN-PSO integration achieved lower root mean square error (RMSE) in all the iterations. Third, state-of-the-art extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost) image classifier was used to derive the land use/land cover (LULC) map of the first study area and assess the transferability of the selected features on the second and third regions. The Xgboost classifier obtained 91.68%, 89.54%, and 89.33% overall accuracies for the first, second, and third sites, respectively. ANN contributed to an intelligent approach for identifying which features are more likely to be relevant and discriminate the land cover types. The proposed integrated FS is a promising approach and an efficient tool for determining significant features and enhancing the detection of urban LULC classes from WV-3 data.

TI  - Synergistic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for improved LULC mapping with special reference to bad land class: a case study for Yamuna River floodplain, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High accuracy land use/land cover (LULC) mapping of Yamuna Chambal ravines for reclamation and conservation of these degraded/badlands is indispensable. Integration of freely available SAR datasets along with medium to high resolution optical data is one of the best approach for high accuracy LULC mapping. The objective of the presented study is to evaluate the fusion technique for Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data for high accuracy LULC mapping in order to assess the area occupied by these negative landforms i.e., ravines. The VH-polarization fused image with Sentinel-2 optical data gives the best accuracy of 85% followed by VV-polarization fused image with same datasets of 84% accuracy whereas Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 provides the accuracy of 60 and 80%, respectively. The prepared LULC maps shown that bad land (Ravine class) occupied an area in the range of 600-700 km(2) using combinations of different datasets as the wastelands in the area required immediate reclamation and conservation measures to be adopted. However, asymptotic performance of fusion technique for SAR and optical data further elucidate its successful implementation and dominancy over other datasets for improved LULC mapping.

TI  - Convcast: An embedded convolutional LSTM based architecture for precipitation nowcasting using satellite data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowcasting of precipitation is a difficult spatiotemporal task because of the non-uniform characterization of meteorological structures over time. Recently, convolutional LSTM has been shown to be successful in solving various complex spatiotemporal based problems. In this research, we propose a novel precipitation nowcasting architecture 'Convcast' to predict various short-term precipitation events using satellite data. We train Convcast with ten consecutive NASA's IMERG precipitation data sets each at intervals of 30 minutes. We use the trained neural network model to predict the eleventh precipitation data of the corresponding ten precipitation sequence. Subsequently, the predicted precipitation data are used iteratively for precipitation nowcasting of up to 150 minutes lead time. Convcast achieves an overall accuracy of 0.93 with an RMSE of 0.805 mm/h for 30 minutes lead time, and an overall accuracy of 0.87 with an RMSE of 1.389 mm/h for 150 minutes lead time. Experiments on the test dataset demonstrate that Convcast consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art optical flow based nowcasting algorithms. Results from this research can be used for nowcasting of weather events from satellite data as well as for future on-board processing of precipitation data.

TI  - Invasion of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) into the United States: Developing a National Response to an Invasive Species Crisis Through Collaborative Research and Outreach Efforts
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys (Stal), the brown marmorated stink bug, is a globally invasive stink bug species. Its first major outbreak was in the United States, where it has caused millions of dollars in damage, threatened livelihoods of specialty crop growers and impacted row crop growers, and become an extreme nuisance pest in and around dwellings. The BMSB IPM Working Group, funded by the Northeastern IPM Center, was central to providing a mechanism to form a multidisciplinary team and develop initial and subsequent research, Extension, regulatory and consumer priorities. Ultimately, a project team consisting of over 50 scientists from 11 institutions in 10 states obtained the largest ever USDA-NIFA Specialty Crop Research Initiative CAP grant, totaling over $10.7 million, to tackle this crisis over a 5-yr period (2011-2016). Researchers and Extension educators integrated stakeholder feedback throughout the course of the project, and priorities evolved according to needs of affected growers and public stakeholders. Initially, the team focused on identification of H. halys, its damage symptoms and crop-specific risks, and short-term mitigation strategies for crop protection. Subsequently, work focused on its biology, ecology, and behavior leading to the development of potential longer-term IPM tactics and landscape level management solutions, including biological control. This work continues under a second SCRI CAP grant (2016-2021). The information from the initial team reached an estimated 22,000 specialty crop stakeholder contacts via Extension efforts, and over 600 million people via mainstream media. We highlight the main lessons learned from coordinating a national response to the threat posed by H. halys to agriculture in the United States.

TI  - Mapping distribution of Sundarban mangroves using Sentinel-2 data and new spectral metric for detecting their health condition
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study explores the suitability of Sentinel-2 images for mapping the physiological conditions of Sundarban mangroves and identifying suitable wavebands for the purpose. This work finds two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of Sentinel-2 appropriate and proposes a new spectral metric, namely Discriminant Normalized Vegetation Index (DNVI) based on these two bands. The spectral profile of mangroves is validated with the hyperspectral and high spatial resolution Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) data. DNVI emphasized the importance of SWIR bands in segregating different health conditions of similar and dissimilar mangrove species assemblages. Classification using Support Vector Machine supervised learning model discriminated mangroves with an overall accuracy of 93.9%. The article highlighted the competence of high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images and the proposed spectral metric can be exploited for mapping mangrove assemblages and their health at different eco-regions.

TI  - Interaction between sediment transport rate and tectonic activity: the case of Kizilirmak Basin on the tectonically active NAFZ, Turkey
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree of interaction between sediment transport rate and tectonic activity is a major issue that draws the attention of researchers. Because of the complexity in the modeling process of uplift and subsidence rate, it is quite difficult to determine the rate of interaction between erosion and tectonic activity. In this study, the sediment transport rate of Kizilirmak Basin, which is located on the tectonically active North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), was investigated to determine the effect of tectonic activity on sediment transport rate. The sediment transport rate of the basin was evaluated by using the drainage channel width, the topographic wetness index (TWI), and the revised universal soil equation (RUSLE) model. The Aster Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes, a 1:800,000 scale soil map, and 30 years of rainfall records at 41 stations were used for the analysis. The drainage channel width, the TWI, and derivation and grid-based integration of the RUSLE parameters were performed by using GIS (terrain analysis, spatial data analysis) and remote sensing image processing techniques. The relationship among the derived parameters and tectonic activity was evaluated by Getis-Ord Gi*statistics. The results show that at the 99 and 95% confidence intervals, statistically significant cold spot values of the channel widths, hot spot values of the mean annual soil loss values, and cold spots of the TWI values are more intensely clustered around fault lines. These clustering areas not only indicate the areas where the rate of sediment transport is high, but also the areas where the tectonic activity of the NAFZ is more vigorous.

TI  - Predicting grain protein content of field-grown winter wheat with satellite images and partial least square algorithm
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been used as an important means of modern crop production monitoring, especially for wheat quality prediction in the middle and late growth period. In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating grain protein content (GPC) through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between 14 remote sensing variables obtained from images of environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting small satellite constellation system equipped with wide-band CCD sensors (abbreviated as HJ-CCD) and field-grown winter wheat GPC. The 14 remote sensing variables were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), R-blue (reflectance at blue band), R-green (reflectance at green band), R-red (reflectance at red band) and R-nir (reflectance at near infrared band). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing model of predicting wheat GPC. The research showed a close relationship between wheat GPC and 12 remote sensing variables other than Rblue and Rgreen of the spectral reflectance bands. Among them, except PSRI and Rblue, Rgreen and Rred, other remote sensing vegetation indexes had significant multiple correlations. The optimal principal components of PLS model used to predict wheat GPC were: NDVI, SIPI, PSRI and EVI. All these were sensitive variables to predict wheat GPC. Through modeling set and verification set evaluation, GPC prediction models' coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.84 and 0.8, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.43% and 0.54%, respectively. It indicated that the PLS algorithm model predicted wheat GPC better than models for linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The PLS algorithm model's prediction accuracies were above 90%. The improvement was by more than 20% than the model for LR algorithm and more than 15% higher than the model for PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the accuracy of remotely predicting winter wheat GPC through satellite images, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion.

TI  - An aerosol climatology for global models based on the tropospheric aerosol scheme in the Integrated Forecasting System of ECMWF
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An aerosol climatology to represent aerosols in the radiation schemes of global atmospheric models was recently developed. We derived the climatology from a reanalysis of atmospheric composition produced by the Copernicus Atmo-sphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As an example of an application in a global atmospheric model, we discuss the technical aspects of the implementation in the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS) and the impact of the new climatology on the medium-range weather forecasts and 1-year simulations. The new aerosol climatology was derived by combining a set of model simulations with constrained meteorological conditions and an atmospheric composition reanalysis for the period 2003-2013 produced by the IFS. The aerosol fields of the reanalysis are constrained by assimilating the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrievals product by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. In a further step, we used modelled aerosol fields to correct the aerosol speciation and the vertical profiles of the aerosol reanalysis fields. The new climatology provides the monthly-mean mass mixing ratio of five aerosol species constrained by assimilated MODIS AOT. Using the new climatology in the ECMWF-IFS leads to changes in the direct aerosol radiative effect compared to the climatology previously implemented, which have a small but non-impact on the forecast skill of large-scale weather patterns in the medium-range. However, details of the regional distribution of aerosol radiative forcing can have a large local impact. This is the case for the area of the Arabian Peninsula and the northern Indian Ocean. Here changes in the radiative forcing of the mineral dust significantly improve the summer monsoon circulation.

TI  - Bare Earth's Surface Spectra as a Proxy for Soil Resource Monitoring
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth's surface dynamics provide essential information for guiding environmental and agricultural policies. Uncovered and unprotected surfaces experience several undesirable effects, which can affect soil ecosystem functions. We developed a technique to identify global bare surface areas and their dynamics based on multitemporal remote sensing images to aid the spatiotemporal evaluation of anthropic and natural phenomena. The bare Earth's surface and its changes were recognized by Landsat image processing over a time range of 30 years using the Google Earth Engine platform. Two additional products were obtained with a similar technique: a) Earth's bare surface frequency, which represents where and how many times a single pixel was detected as bare surface, based on Landsat series, and b) Earth's bare soil tendency, which represents the tendency of bare surface to increase or decrease. This technique enabled the retrieval of bare surfaces on 32% of Earth's total land area and on 95% of land when considering only agricultural areas. From a multitemporal perspective, the technique found a 2.8% increase in bare surfaces during the period on a global scale. However, the rate of soil exposure decreased by similar to 4.8% in the same period. The increase in bare surfaces shows that agricultural areas are increasing worldwide. The decreasing rate of soil exposure indicates that, unlike popular opinion, more soils have been covered due to the adoption of conservation agriculture practices, which may reduce soil degradation.

TI  - Role of meteorology and local orography on a flood event in the Lower Subansiri Basin and post-flood changes to land use and land cover
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme rainfall in the Arunachal Himalaya has the potential to create floods in the downstream regions of Assam, with the rivers in the region exceeding their capacity and competence. High-intensity rainfall also leads to higher sediment generation in the sub-Himalayan catchment. Though floods have been incurring huge losses to both life and property frequently in Assam, there are only a few studies on the meteorological and orographic dynamics of such extreme rainfall events and their potential to create a flood. The present study highlights the pre-flood and post-flood scenario in the Lower Subansiri Basin (LSB) in Brahmaputra valley, Assam, through satellite data analysis and ground field surveys to establish linkages between extreme rainfall events and a subsequent major flood event that occurred during September 2012. We observed that the flood was mostly triggered by the extreme rainfall induced by orographic lifting of moisture-laden winds from the south. In addition to submerging an area of similar to 1900 km(2), the flood also brought along fragile Neogene elastics that increased barren soil over the floodplains by similar to 47% compared to the pre-flood period, thus disrupting the agrarian economy of the region for several cropping seasons. These findings demonstrate the need for a reliable meteorological forecast for extreme rainfall as a prerequisite for developing effective flood-forecasting models in the Brahmaputra valley, which will positively contribute towards flood hazard management in the region.

TI  - Laser Pointing Error Estimation Based on Energy Data of LOLA System
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain the moon elevation with high accuracy, it is necessary to accurately estimate the pointing error of laser. During the on-orbit operation of the lunar orbital laser altimeter (LOLA), the laser pointing at night deviates from that during the daytime clue to the large temperature difference between clay and night. This study first establishes a theoretical model of the detector's received energy when the spot deviates from the center of the receiving field of view. Then, it analyzes the theoretical relation between the spot's offset and relative received energy based on this model, and puts forward a laser pointing error estimation method based on spot energy. Subsequently, using the energy data generated when LOLA passed through the Aestuum region during the mapping orbit (12 months), this energy data is combined with the proposed estimation method, and laser pointing errors of LOLA at night in moon arc estimated to be 140.62 mu rad along the orbit direction and -143.17 mu rad in the vertical orbit direction, which arc consistent with the results derived from LOLA earth scanning experiment and orbital intersection altitude data.

TI  - Decadal loss of paddy fields driven by cumulative human activities in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy fields are valuable agricultural land resources in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of China but have been threatened by the expansion and intensification of human activities over recent decades. How paddy fields evolve under human disturbances remains poorly understood, which is critical for land use planning to compromise agricultural production and ecosystem conservation as limited land resource is available. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of change in paddy fields were depicted and principal driving forces were explained. Mapping of paddy fields with LANDSAT satellite images reveals a constant declining trend by 14.3% in the period 1990-2015. The gross loss area is 903.3 km(2), with an annual average decreasing rate being 36.1 km(2)center dot yr(-1). The transformation matrix between paddy fields and other land uses explicitly explains the impact trajectories of multiple human activities. Specifically, 39.6% (408.1 km(2)) of the gross loss was converted to built-up lands, reflecting town translocation and human resettlement (involuntary population migration) proposed by construction of the Three Gorges Dam, as well as urbanization, industrial development and infrastructure expansion along with economic development. The area converted to forests accounts for 26.4% (238.2 km(2)), which could be ascribed to land abandonment and the reforestation campaign. 23.1% (208.7 km(2)) was converted to dry croplands by shifts in farmers' preference on crop selection following socioeconomic changes (e.g., voluntary rural population migration, land use policy adjustment, commercial farming enterprises expansion). 46.5 km(2) was converted to water bodies, indicating the effect of impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir.

TI  - FUSAR-Ship: building a high-resolution SAR-AIS matchup dataset of Gaofen-3 for ship detection and recognition
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is China's first civil C-band fully Polarimetric spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) primarily missioned for ocean remote sensing and marine monitoring. This paper proposes an automatic sea segmentation, ship detection, and SAR-AIS matchup procedure and an extensible marine target taxonomy of 15 primary ship categories, 98 sub-categories, and many non-ship targets. The FUSAR-Ship high-resolution GF-3 SAR dataset is constructed by running the procedure on a total of 126 GF-3 scenes covering a large variety of sea, land, coast, river and island scenarios. It includes more than 5000 ship chips with AIS messages as well as samples of strong scatterer, bridge, coastal land, islands, sea and land clutter. FUSAR-Ship is intended as an open benchmark dataset for ship and marine target detection and recognition. A preliminary 8-type ship classification experiment based on convolutional neural networks demonstrated that an average of 79% test accuracy can be achieved.

TI  - Salivary cortisol levels and anxiety in melanoma patients undergoing sentinel lymph node excision under local anesthesia versus general anesthesia: a prospective study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) can be performed in tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) or general anesthesia (GA). Perioperative cortisol level changes and anxiety are common in surgical interventions and might be influenced by the type of anesthesia. In this study, we intended to determine whether the type of anesthesia impacts the patients' perioperative levels of salivary cortisol (primary outcome) and the feeling of anxiety evaluated by psychological questionnaires (secondary outcome). Methods All melanoma patients of age undergoing SLNE at the University Hospital Essen, Germany, could be included in the study. Exclusion criteria were patients' intake of glucocorticoids or psychotropic medication during the former 6 months, pregnancy, age under 18 years, and BMI >= 30 as salivary cortisol levels were reported to be significantly impacted by obesity and might confound results. Results In total, 111 melanoma patients undergoing SLNE were included in our prospective study between May 2011 and April 2017 and could choose between TLA or GA. Salivary cortisol levels were measured three times intraoperatively, twice on the third and second preoperative day and twice on the second postoperative day. To assess anxiety, patients completed questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) perioperatively. Patients of both groups exhibited comparable baseline levels of cortisol and perioperative anxiety levels. Independent of the type of anesthesia, all patients showed significantly increasing salivary cortisol level from baseline to 30 min before surgery (T3) (TLA: t = 5.07, p < 0.001; GA: t = 3.09, p = 0.006). Post hoc independent t tests showed that the TLA group exhibited significantly higher cortisol concentrations at the beginning of surgery (T4; t = 3.29, p = 0.002) as well as 20 min after incision (T5; t = 277, p = 0.008) compared to the GA group. Conclusions The type of anesthesia chosen for SLNE surgery significantly affects intraoperative cortisol levels in melanoma patients. Further studies are mandatory to evaluate the relevance of endogenous perioperative cortisol levels on the postoperative clinical course.

TI  - Nonlinear patterns in mercury bioaccumulation in American alligators are a function of predicted age
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury is a widespread, naturally occurring contaminant that biomagnifies in wetlands due to the methylation of this element by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Species that feed at the top trophic level within wetlands are predicted to have higher mercury loads compared to species feeding at lower trophic levels and are therefore often used for mercury biomonitoring. However, mechanisms for mercury bioaccumulation in sentinel species are often poorly understood, due to a lack of long-term studies or an inability to differentiate between confounding variables. We examined mercury bioaccumulation patterns in the whole blood of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) from a long-term mark-recapture study (1979-2017) in South Carolina, USA. Using a growth model and auxiliary information on predicted age at first capture, we differentiated between age- and size-related variation in mercury bioaccumulation, which are often confounded in alligators due to their determinate growth pattern. Contrary to predictions that the oldest or largest individuals were likely to have the highest mercury concentrations, our best-supported model indicated a peak in mercury concentration at 30-40 years of age, depending on the sex, and lower concentrations in the youngest and oldest animals. To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we re-analyzed data from a previously published study of mercury in alligators sampled at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. Unlike the South Carolina data, the data from Florida contained minimal auxiliary information regarding age, yet the best supported model similarly indicated a peaked rather than increasing relationship between mercury and body size, a less-precise indicator of age. These findings highlight how long-term monitoring can differentiate between confounding variables (e.g., age and size) to better elucidate complex relationships between contaminant exposure and demographic factors in sentinel species.

TI  - Tradeoffs between agricultural production and ecosystem services: A case study in Zhangye, Northwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans have increasingly intervened in the nature to advance socioeconomic development at the expense of ecosystem services. Tradeoffs between ecosystem services and socioeconomic development are inevitable and should be considered in sustainable ecosystem management. This is no exception in Zhangye where intensive agricultural activities have significantly affected its ecological conditions. Thus, this study evaluated the tradeoffs between agricultural production and key ecosystem services along with their spatial distributions at the watershed level in Zhangye based on multisource observation data. The key ecosystem services, including net primary productivity (NPP), water yield, and soil conservation, were evaluated for the years 2000, 2010, and 2015 using remote sensing data and the InVEST model. The Morishima elasticity of substitution (MES) between these ecosystem services and agricultural production were then estimated by applying a quadratic directional output distance function, and mapped to determine the tradeoffs. The results showed that the average NPP and annual water yield respectively increased by 22% and 24%, while annual soil conservation decreased by 22% during 2000-2015. The average MES values for agricultural production with NPP, water yield, and soil conservation were 0.14,-0.69, and -0.56, respectively. This indicated the existence of a synergetic relationship between agricultural production and NPP as well as tradeoff relationships between agricultural production and water yield/soil conservation. Differences in the spatial patterns of the relationships between agricultural production and these ecosystem services were observed. Significant tradeoff relationships were observed for agricultural production with water yield and soil conservation in the upper reach of Zhangye. It indicated that increasing agricultural production would be at the cost of decreased water yield and soil conservation, especially in the upper reach area. The quantification and spatial pattern determinations of tradeoffs between ecosystem services and agricultural production is useful for the development of regional ecological conservation policy and sustainable ecosystem management.

TI  - A New Way for Walen Test of Alfvenic Fluctuations in Solar Wind Streams via EEMD
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pure Alfven waves at 1 au can be effectively identified by a Walen test of plasma and magnetic field observations. In this study, a new method, based on the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique, is proposed for analyzing Alfven fluctuations in two ways: (1) the Walen test relied on a time-dependent frame, which is extracted from the trend of differences between plasma and Alfven velocity; and (2) a modified Walen test of the reconstructed Alfvenic and plasma velocity fluctuations by EEMD, after removing the high/low-frequency components irrelevant to Alfvenicity. Referencing the three validated methods mentioned in Chao et al., the same four cases in high-speed solar wind steams are tested by the EEMD method, considering Alfvenic parameters such as the Walen slope, the standard deviation ratio, the Alfven ratio, the normalized cross helicity, the normalized residual energy, and the mean deviation relative to 1. The test results indicate that the first EEMD method can improve most Alfvenic parameters, since a time-varying velocity of the De Hoffmann-Teller frame is obtained from the process of self-adaptive data analysis, especially for complex cases with nonstationary and multiple background frames. The second EEMD method provides a kind of flexible testing to reconstruct the optimal fluctuations satisfied for the Walen relation, which achieves similar or even better results than normal prior methods based on bandpass filtering. We suggest that the EEMD method can be an alternative way to identify large-amplitude Alfven waves in solar wind streams with single-satellite data.

TI  - Urban growth sustainability of Islamabad, Pakistan, over the last 3 decades: a perspective based on object-based backdating change detection
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth copes with problems in sustainable development. In developing countries, particularly, sustainable development of urban growth copes with severe challenges with respect to sluggish economic and social growth, population boom, environmental deterioration, unemployment, slums and so on. Time series of remote sensing data provide critical support on sustainability assessment. However, the urban spatial extend cannot be accurately extracted from land cover data. Targeting the urban growth and its sustainability in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, this study extracts urban area from four periods of Landsat images between 1990 and 2018 using an innovative object-based backdating change detection method and two criteria for extracting urban land from impervious surface. We prove that impervious surface cover and urban area increased 273.10% and 426.21%, respectively, over the last 3 decades. We identify five factors playing important role in urban growth: population, transportation systems, master planning, industrial and real estate development, and neighbor urban effect. In this study, we assess the socio-economic sustainability associated with slum growth and census data, and the environmental sustainability in relation to the variations of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in forest areas. We found that slums increased with the corresponding growth of urban area and population, reflecting sluggish economic increase in Islamabad. We found that the area of woodland increased 9.29%, but its NDVI decreased from 0.668 to 0.551, implying a deteriorative trend of environmental condition.

For a better understanding of internal lake processes, we examined microbial biodiversity and potential biogeochemical interactions in the oligotrophic deep high-mountain Lake Redon (Pyrenees, 2240 m altitude) using shotgun metagenomics. We analyzed the two ends of the range of environmental conditions found in Lake Redon, at 2 and 60 m depths. Bacteria were the most abundant component of the metagenomic reads (>90%) and the diversity indices of both taxonomic (16S and 18S rRNA) and functional (carbon-, nitrogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorous-cycling) related genes were higher in the bottom dark layer than in the upper compartment. A marked segregation was observed both in biodiversity and in the dominant energy and biomass generating pathways between the extremes. The aerobic respiration was mainly dominated by heterotrophic Burkholderiales at the top and Actinobacteria and Burkholderiales at the lake bottom. The potential for an active nitrogen cycle (nitrogen fixation, nitrification, nitrite oxidation, and nitrate reduction) was mainly found at 60 m, and potential for methanogenesis, anaerobic ammonia oxidation and dissimilatory sulfur pathways were only observed there. Some unexpected and mostly unseen energy and biomass pathways were found relevant for the biogeochemical cycling in lake Redon, i.e., those related to carbon monoxide oxidation and phosphonates processing. We provide a general scheme of the main biogeochemical processes that may operate in the sentinel deep Lake Redon. This framework may help for a better understanding of the whole lake metabolism.

TI  - Spatial stochastic model for predicting soil organic matter using remote sensing data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soil organic matter (SOM) estimation could provide critical information to understand soil organic carbon sequestration, soil fertility, and the global carbon cycle. A nearest-neighbourhood autoregressive moving average (NN-ARMA) modelling technique along with linear regression has been used to predict localized soil SOM variation based on topographical characteristics and vegetation indices in semi-arid region of Saudi Arabia. Seven topographic variables derived using DEM, and twelve vegetation indices obtained from Landsat 8 used in the model. The best NN-ARMA model showed seven significant variables explaining 96.4% of the total variation of SOM, whereas the best linear regression model could explain 78.8% of the total variation of SOM. The results showed that NN-ARMA model gave better results compared to the linear regression model. Our research gave a better understanding of the possibility of accurate estimation of SOM using the NN-ARMA approach using topographical characteristics and vegetation indices easily acquired by RS sensors.

TI  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza in Greece: A pooled analysis across six seasons, 2013-2014 to 2018-2019
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Monitoring seasonal influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) is key to inform vaccination strategies and sustain uptake. Pooling data across multiple seasons increases precision and allows for subgroup analyses, providing more conclusive evidence. Our aim was to assess VE against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza in Greece over six seasons, from 2013 to 2014 to 2018-2019, using routinely collected surveillance data.Methods: Swab samples from hospitalized patients across the country were tested for influenza by RT-PCR. We used the test-negative design, with patients testing positive for influenza serving as cases and those testing negative serving as controls. VE was calculated as one minus the Odds Ratio (OR) for influenza vaccination, estimated by mixed-effects logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, hospitalization type (being in intensive care or not), time from symptom onset to swabbing, and calendar time. Stratified estimates by age and hospitalization type were obtained, and also subgroup estimates by influenza type/subtype and season. Antigenic and genetic characterization of a subset of circulating influenza strains was performed.Results: A total of 3,882 test-positive cases and 5,895 test-negative controls were analyzed. Across all seasons, adjusted VE was 45.5% (95% CI: 31.6-56.6) against all influenza, 62.8% against A(H1N1)pdm09 (95% CI: 40.7-76.7), 28.2% against A(H3N2) (95% CI: 12.0-41.3) and 45.5% against influenza B (95% CI: 29.1-58.1). VE was slightly lower for patients aged 60 years and over, and similar between patients hospitalized inside or outside intensive care. Circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 and B strains were antigenically similar to the vaccine strains, whereas A(H3N2) were not.Conclusion: Our results confirm the public health benefits from seasonal influenza vaccination, despite the suboptimal effectiveness against A(H3N2) strains. Continued monitoring of VE is essential, and routinely collected surveillance data can be valuable in this regard. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detection of surface anomalies through fractal analysis and their relation to morphotectonics (High Zagros belt, Iran)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractal geometry is considered as a new method for quantitative analysis and explanation of surface complexities and roughness in self-similar or self-affine landforms. In the present study, the surface fractal dimensions were investigated by a cellular model by covering divider method and remote sensing data, in a complex morphotectonic region in terms of tectonic, geological, and geomorphological structures along the margin of the High Zagros Belt. Results of this study indicated that surface anomalies can be detected by cellular fractal model due to variations at the boundary of lithological units and structural zones, and along faults that can change the characters of the fractal dimension of landforms. Investigation of wavelet analyses on two profiles of study area shows that the amplitude and frequency of the fractal dimension is related to lithological and structural zones boundaries, and to the presence of faults. In this study, the lowest fractal dimension is associated with the integrated units of Mesozoic orbitolina limestone on the border of the two structural zones of Sanandaj-Sirjan and High Zagros belt. However, the presence of friable and erodible Quaternary formations increases the fractal dimension. There is an inverse relationship between the fractal dimension and elevation and Terrain Ruggedness Index, indicating that mountains have lower fractal dimensions than lowlands. The results of the present study show that fractal dimensional changes in topographically complex zones depend on the interaction of a set of lith-ological, tectonic, and geomorphological factors, and allow for a systematic quantitative analysis of landforms.

TI  - Estimation of satellite-derived lake water surface temperatures in the western Mediterranean: Integrating multi-source, multi-resolution imagery and a long-term field dataset using a time series approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a key parameter to help study the environmental and ecological impacts of climate change. In this work, we measured the LSWT of 1 natural and 23 artificial lakes located on the island of Sardinia in the western Mediterranean, which is a region where changes in climate are projected to have significant impacts. By integrating multi-source and multi-resolution datasets of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat and long-term in situ temperature observations, we detected, measured, and analysed the LSWT trends during the period of 2000-2018 across all the investigated lakes.Methodologically, we demonstrated that a simplified approached based on Planck's equation for Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) data could be a valid alternative to radiative transfer equation retrieval methods for the retrieval of LSWT without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrated that rescaled and independently validated MOD112A-derived LSWT showed good accuracy, efficiently filled the spatial and temporal gaps in long-term in situ LSWT, and could be used for long-term LSWT trend detection and measurement.All 24 lakes showed an annual warming trend of +0.010 degrees C/y, warming winter trend of +0.013 degrees C/y, and cooling summer trend of -0.038 degrees C/y during the period of 2000-2018. This study demonstrated that the measured trend rates could be explained by and were strongly correlated with the climatology of Italy for the 2000-2018 period. Finally, we demonstrated the key role and the importance of the availability of long-term in situ temperature datasets. The approach used in this study is up-scalable to other medium to low-resolution TIR sensors as well as to other long-term monitoring sites, such as LTER-Italy, LTER-Europe, or ILTER sites.

TI  - Machine learning-based detection of soil salinity in an arid desert region, Northwest China: A comparison between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of soil salinization is considered as one of the most important steps in combating global climate change, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Multi-spectral remote sensing (RS) data including Landsat series provides the potential for frequent surveys for soil salinization at various scales and resolutions. Additionally, the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite constellation has temporal revisiting frequency of 5 days, which has been proven to be an ideal approach to assess soil salinity. Yet, studies on detailed comparison in soil salinity tracking between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI remain limited. For this purpose, we collected a total of 64 topsoil samples in an arid desert region, the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) to compare the monitoring accuracy between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. In this study, the Cubist model was trained using RS-derived covariates (spectral bands, Tasseled Cap transformation-derived wetness (TCW), and satellite salinity indices) and laboratory measured electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC). The results showed that the measured soil salinity had a significant correlation with surface soil moisture (Pearson's r = 0.75). The introduction of TCW generated satisfactory estimating performance. Compared with OLI dataset, the combination of MSI dataset and Cubist model yielded overall better model performance and accuracy measures (R-2 = 0.912, RMSE = 6.462 dS m(-1), NRMSE = 9.226%, RPD = 3.400 and RPIQ = 6.824, respectively). The differences between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI were distinguishable. In conclusion, MSI image with finer spatial resolution performed better than OLI. Combining RS data sets and their derived TCW within a Cubist framework yielded accurate regional salinity map. The increased temporal revisiting frequency and spectral resolution of MSI data are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality soil salinity information of desert soils.

AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diarrhea pathogens in Pudong New Areas of Shanghai from 2013 to 2017 to provide evidence for control and prevention of the disease. Methods: From Jan 2013 to Dec 2017, active surveillance program on diarrhea was conducted in 14 sentinel hospitals (three tertiary-level and nine secondary-level, and two primary-level hospitals) in Pudong New Areas of Shanghai, based on location, catchment areas and number of patients. All recruited outpatients were interviewed in hospitals, using a standard questionnaire. Stool specimens were collected and tested for five viral and eight bacterial pathogens. Results: A total of 9 301 cases with infectious diarrhea were included, and the overall positive rate was 55.7% (5 179). Positive rates of single virus, single bacteria and mixed infections were 26.7% (2 481), 17.0% (1 579) and 12.0% (1 119), respectively. For single infection, the most commonly detected viruses appeared as norovirus (15.4%, 1 428/9 301) and rotavirus (7.2%, 667/9 301). The most commonly detected bacteria were diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (6.7%, 619/9 301) and non-typhoid Salmonella (3.3%, 305/9 301). The most common mixed infections were caused by virus-bacteria (4.9%, 459/9 301). Norovirus (17.0%, 838/4 938) showed the highest positive rates, followed by Escherichia coli (7.2%, 354/4 938), both seen in the age group of 20-59 years old group. Rotavirus (9.4%, 178/1 896) and non-typhoid Salmonella (4.9%, 93/1 896) were the most common pathogens found in the age group of 0-4 years old. The prevalence of norovirus peaked both in spring and autumn. The other peaks were seen as: Rotavirus in winter, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in summer and non-typhoid Salmonella in summer. Conclusions: Our data showed that the positive rates of infectious diarrhea pathogens were high in Pudong New Areas of Shanghai from 2013 to 2017. The dominant pathogens would include norovirus, rotavirus and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli but with differenct distributions in age groups. Obvious seasonal patterns were also observed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the isolation rate, antimicrobial resistance phenotype, and molecular type characteristics of Klebsiella pneumoniae from infectious diarrhea outpatients in Tai'an. Methods: A total of 866 stool samples were collected from infectious diarrhea cases in sentinel hospitals in 6 counties of Tai'an from 2013 to 2017. The strains were isolated from stool samples of the cases and identified by biochemical test. Micro broth dilution method was used to detect the drug resistance of the strains. The molecular typing was conducted by using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: The detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the stool samples was 7.97% (69/866), with significant differences among the 6 counties (chi(2)=39.627, P=0.000). Sixty- eight out of the 69 strains were resistant to 15 antibiotics with resistance rate 98.55%(68/69). The resistance to ampicillin (AMP) was highest (84.06%) (58/69), followed by sulfamethoxazole (SOX) (72.46%)(50/69). There were 40 drug resistance profiles, and the predominant resistance profile was AMP-SOX detected (n=10). The multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains accounted for 33.33% (23/69). The 69 strains could be divided into 65 PFGE patterns, and no predominant PFGE pattern or cluster was observed. Conclusions: Klebsiella pneumoniae was detected in the stool samples of diarrhea- syndrome outpatients, indicating the risk for community-acquired infection; the strains were resistant to multiplex antibiotics, with wide drug-resistance profiles and high multi-drug resistance rates. The PFGE patterns were diverse, which showed no correlation with drug resistance profiles. Our study indicated that it necessary to strengthen the surveillance and detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae from diarrhea outpatients, which could facilitate the prevention of the emergence and spread of drug resistance strains and the protection of susceptible population.

TI  - Plant Population Dynamics in a Degraded Coastal Wetland and Implications for the Carbon Cycle
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat destruction caused by human activities is threatening wetland plants. Based on Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and Google Earth images, we analysed the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant populations in a degraded wetland in the Minjiang River Estuary from 2009 to 2019. Field survey records, tasselled cap transformation, and supervised classification were used for the image interpretation. The results indicate that the plant habitat area decreased by 42.1% over these 10 years. Consequently, the distribution area of each dominant species declined, and the proportion of total vegetated area in the habitat decreased from 53.1% to 32.6%. Moreover, the dominance relations of the species changed fromSpartina alterniflora > Phragmites australis > Cyperus malaccensis > Scirpus triquetertoP. australis > S. alterniflora > C. malaccensis > S. triqueter. We predict that the vegetation landscape in the wetland will be composed exclusively ofP. australisandS. alternifloraif habitat destruction continues. Finally, our research shows that the NPCS (net plant carbon sequestration) and PCS (plant carbon stock) in the wetland and the average values of methane flux, NPCS, PCS, and SOCS (sediment organic carbon stock) in the vegetated area have all decreased due to plant population declines.

AB  - PurposeOne's standpoint and consequent research paradigm impacts how we conduct research, including study design, analyses interpretation and dissemination of results. In 2017, the authors began PhD, studying the potential barriers to aftercare treatment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged under 16 who had sustained a burn injury in one of five major hospitals in Australia. The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approachAs Aboriginal PhD students, the authors are conducting research using Aboriginal ontology as a framework, which is based on a holistic framework with interconnectedness, person-centred care and Aboriginal ways of knowing as the foundation. The framework has been shaped by the first author's knowing, being and doing, and the authors' worldview has informed and shaped the standpoint and the way the research has been developed and conducted.FindingsIt was important for the authors to have a connectedness to each aspect of the research and to each individual person that shared their story: this was paramount to the ways of being.Originality/valueThis connectedness stems from growing up on the authors' country and learning from elders, from the connection to all entities living around, within and with the authors. The Indigenous research methodology was used throughout the study, including yarning and Dadirri, a way of deep listening and learning, as the basis for interviewing.

TI  - An Improved Approach for Selecting and Validating Burn Severity Indices in Forested Landscapes
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity maps based on remotely sensed reflectance data provide a useful way for land managers and researchers to represent and compare spatial variation in fire effects among wildfires and prescribed fires. A need exists for an objective and rigorous selection approach that ensures the best possible spatial predictions of burn severity. The aim of this study was to present and test a methodology for selecting the optimal burn severity index from a suite of calculation and validation options that can be used to produce data for more rigorously comparing ecological effects of fire that occur in contrasting phenologies. In our study, we cross-validated remote sensing data with field data and we tested the predictive ability of 12 cross-validated index calibrations that were generated using common statistical approaches, to predict field-measured burn severity indices collected at burned and unburned areas in New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, provide convincing evidence for the use of CBI as a field-based index over WCBI, and provide a cross-validated method for calculating burn severity in this vegetation type that can be used by managers and researchers.

TI  - Hurricane-Induced Rainfall is a Stronger Predictor of Tropical Forest Damage in Puerto Rico Than Maximum Wind Speeds
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Projected increases in cyclonic storm intensity under a warming climate will have profound effects on forests, potentially changing these ecosystems from carbon sinks to sources. Forecasting storm impacts on these ecosystems requires consideration of risk factors associated with storm meteorology, landscape structure, and forest attributes. Here we evaluate risk factors associated with damage severity caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma across Puerto Rican forests. Using field and remote sensing data, total forest aboveground biomass (AGB) lost to the storms was estimated at 10.44 (+/- 2.33) Tg, ca. 23% of island-wide pre-hurricane forest AGB. Storm-related rainfall was a stronger predictor of forest damage than maximum wind speeds. Soil water storage capacity was also an important risk factor, corroborating the influence of rainfall on forest damage. Expected increases of 20% in hurricane-associated rainfall in the North Atlantic highlight the need to consider how such shifts, together with high speed winds, will affect terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Alternative paradigms for sustainability: the Maori worldview
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe authors do not claim that the following represents the views of any one tribe but instead the culmination of the academic literature written on the topic. Marketing's current Western dominant social paradigm (DSP) is said to perpetuate "green", yet unsustainable practices. The DSP does not support strictly pro-environmental practices and its proposed alternative, the new environmental paradigm (NEP), lacks in-depth conceptualisation, especially concerning business and marketing activities. However, the two paradigms contrast so much that a shift from one to the other is vehemently argued against and conceptually rife with problems. This paper aims to expand upon the merits of the NEP using indigenous people's environmental philosophies - specifically the Maori people of New Zealand[1] - as examples of historically supported and successful sustainable philosophies. It conceptualises the Maori view to provide a more practical alternative to the DSP and includes propositions for marketing implementation of this perspective.FindingsBy explicating both the DSP and NEP and reflecting on each through an indigenous Maori view, this paper provides propositions for a broadened paradigm that supports sustainability and its application for sustainable marketing.Originality/valueThis paper is the first to explicate parts of the NEP and broaden its reach by integrating a Maori worldview as an alternative to drastically changing the current DSP. It does so by proposing that marketers embrace a middle ground that is influenced by indigenous belief systems.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fusion for remote sensing data: an overview and new benchmark
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) aims at fusing (temporally dense) coarse resolution images and (temporally sparse) fine resolution images to generate image series with adequate temporal and spatial resolution. In the last decade, STF has drawn a lot of attention and many STF methods have been developed. However, to date the STF domain still lacks benchmark datasets, which is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed in order to foster the development of this field. In this review, we provide (for the first time in the literature) a robust benchmark STF dataset that includes three important characteristics: (1) diversity of regions, (2) long timespan, and (3) challenging scenarios. We also provide a survey of highly representative STF techniques, along with a detailed quantitative and qualitative comparison of their performance with our newly presented benchmark dataset. The proposed dataset is public and available online.

TI  - A new sensor bias-driven spatio-temporal fusion model based on convolutional neural networks
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the tradeoff between scanning swath and pixel size, currently no satellite Earth observation sensors are able to collect images with high spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously. This limits the application of satellite images in many fields, including the characterization of crop yields or the detailed investigation of human-nature interactions. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) is a widely used approach to solve the aforementioned problem. Traditional STF methods reconstruct fine-resolution images under the assumption that changes are able to be transferred directly from one sensor to another. However, this assumption may not hold in real scenarios, owing to the different capacity of available sensors to characterize changes. In this paper, we model such differences as a bias, and introduce a new sensor bias-driven STF model (called BiaSTF) to mitigate the differences between the spectral and spatial distortions presented in traditional methods. In addition, we propose a new learning method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently obtain this bias. An experimental evaluation on two public datasets suggests that our newly developed method achieves excellent performance when compared to other available approaches.

T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza is a disease under surveillance worldwide with different seasonal patterns in temperate and tropical regions. Previous studies have conducted modeling of influenza seasonality using climate variables. This study aimed to identify potential meteorological factors that are associated with influenza seasonality in Jinan, China.Methods: Data from three influenza sentinel hospitals and respective climate factors (average temperature, relatively humidity (RH), absolute humidity (AH), sunshine duration, accumulated rainfall and speed of wind), from 2013 to 2016, were collected. Statistical and wavelet analyses were used to explore the epidemiological characteristics of influenza virus and its potential association with climate factors.Results: The dynamic of influenza was characterized by annual cycle, with remarkable winter epidemic peaks from December to February. Spearman's correlation and wavelet coherence analysis illuminated that temperature, AH and atmospheric pressure were main influencing factors. Multiple wavelet coherence analysis showed that temperature and atmospheric pressure might be the main influencing factors of influenza virus A(H3N2) and influenza virus B, whereas temperature and AH might best shape the seasonality of influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09. During the epidemic season, the prevalence of influenza virus lagged behind the change of temperature by 1-8 weeks and atmospheric pressure by 0.5-3 weeks for different influenza viruses.Conclusion: Climate factors were significantly associated with influenza seasonality in Jinan during the influenza epidemic season and the optional time for influenza vaccination is before November. These finding should be considered in influenza planning of control and prevention.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of SVM and ANN Classifiers using Multilevel Fusion of Multi-Sensor Data in Urban Land Classification
T2  - SENSING AND IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor data fusion has recently received remarkably more attraction in urban land classification. The fusion of multi-resolution and multi-sensor remote sensing data can help in comprehending more information about the same land cover features, thereby, enhancing the classification accuracy. In this field of study, a combination of hyperspectral data in a long-wave infrared range and a very high-resolution data in a visible range has been extensively used for exploring the spectral and spatial features for decision level fusion classification. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating the classifier decisions with the additional ancillary information derived from spectral and spatial features for improvement in the classification accuracy of natural and man-made objects in urban land cover. The paper also presents a detailed performance comparative evaluation of two classifiers i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to show the effectiveness of these classifiers. The results obtained from a decision-based multilevel fusion of spectral and spatial information using hyperspectral and visible data have shown improvement in classification accuracy. The results also reveal that the classification accuracy of the SVM classifier is better than ANN in multi-sensor data using decision level fusion of combined feature set analysis.

TI  - When and Why Do Good People Not Do Good Deeds? Third-Party Observers' Unfavorable Reactions to Negative Workplace Gossip
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A small but growing body of research suggests that witnessing mistreatment affects third-party observers' attitudes and behaviors. Based on the framework of belief in a just world theory, this study examines perverse secondary victimization which is particularly pervasive in negative workplace gossip from a third-party perspective but has nonetheless received little attention in organizational research. We present a moderated mediation model and hypothesize that third-party observers' deservingness judgment would mediate the effect of observed negative workplace gossip and interact with their just world beliefs (BJW) in predicting their unfavorable reactions toward the target (i.e., withholding target support, engaging in target exclusion, or target negative gossip). Additionally, an observer's BJW would exacerbate the positive relationship between observed negative workplace gossip and deservingness judgment, that is, third-party observers with high BJW are more susceptible to victim derogation bias and consider that the target of gossip deserved the victimization experience to maintain their worldview. Data were collected from 210 full-time employees through online questionnaires and the empirical results supported the hypotheses. The study discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

TI  - Geospatial analysis and simulation of glacial lake outburst flood hazard in Shyok Basin of Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Indus Basin (UIB) is prone to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Physical monitoring of such a large area on regular basis is a challenging task especially when the temporal and spatial extent of the hazard is highly variable. The study has been conducted in the Shyok sub-basin of UIB, where there are several human settlements which are endangered due to the GLOF hazard. Sudden breaches in the unstable moraine dams adjoining receding glaciers may occur because of rapid and huge accumulation of turbulent water in the glacial lakes. The purpose of this study was to map the two potentially dangerous glacial lakes and simulate the associated hazard in the downward settlements using HEC-RAS in the GIS environment using Landsat 7 remote sensing data. The ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is utilized to detect flow accumulation of glacial hazard involving slope, elevation, and orientation of the mountain glaciers. The study results have revealed that settlements of the Shyok Basin are threatened by the GLOF hazard. Keeping in view the seasonal growth of the two potentially dangerous glacial lakes of the Shyok Basin, a low discharge of 100 m(3)/s from both lakes can affect 20%, whereas a moderate discharge of 300 m(3)/s and a high discharge of 500 m(3)/s, respectively, can impact 30% and 40% of the Barah village habitat. The results of the study can provide a platform for the establishment of an early warning and monitoring system to minimize the impact of future GLOFs.

TI  - Diverse worldviews education and social inclusion: a comparison between Finnish and Australian approaches to build intercultural and interreligious understanding
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing global issues relating to the decline of the popularity of institutional religions, the rise of numbers of non-religious persons, and new models of spirituality in superdiverse societies have resulted in the need to reconceptualise religious diversity as worldviews diversity, and to critically examine increasing calls for the provision of worldviews education in schools. This paper first examines the key concepts of superdiversity and religious complexity in contemporary societies. It then presents an overview of scholarship pertaining to the concepts of worldviews and worldviews education. It next provides case studies of worldview/s education in Finland and Australia, drawing on data of recently completed qualitative and quantitative studies in the two countries. Finally, it concludes with a comparative analysis of the two contexts, and recommendations pertaining to worldviews education as a means of enhancing cross-cultural literacy, positive attitudes to religious diversity and thereby social inclusion.

M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetic properties of the double perovskites Sm2Mn1+xCo1-xO6 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.12 and 0.26) were investigated. It was found that the Curie temperature, the lattice parameters and the net magnetic moments increased for increasing amounts of Co. An irreversible behavior was observed by measuring, the magnetization after cooling the sample with and without applied magnetic fields (H). The temperature below which the irreversibility was observed is H dependent and the data were nicely fit to de Almeida-Thouless lines. The ac magnetic susceptibility was measured for frequencies f in the range 0.03-10 kHz yielding X similar or equal to 0.003 for the shifting in the freezing, temperature per decade of f. The spin-dynamics were found to follow a power-law with a product of the critical exponents zv of about 4.99. The overall results are understood within a framework where the variation in the bonding angle associated to the super-exchange interactions are taken into consideration.

TI  - Forest-Scale Phenotyping: Productivity Characterisation Through Machine Learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in remote sensing combined with the emergence of sophisticated methods for large-scale data analytics from the field of data science provide new methods to model complex interactions in biological systems. Using a data-driven philosophy, insights from experts are used to corroborate the results generated through analytical models instead of leading the model design. Following such an approach, this study outlines the development and implementation of a whole-of-forest phenotyping system that incorporates spatial estimates of productivity across a large plantation forest. In large-scale plantation forestry, improving the productivity and consistency of future forests is an important but challenging goal due to the multiple interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, the long breeding cycle, and the high variability of growing conditions. Forest phenotypic expression is highly affected by the interaction of environmental conditions and forest management but the understanding of this complex dynamics is incomplete. In this study, we collected an extensive set of 2.7 million observations composed of 62 variables describing climate, forest management, tree genetics, and fine-scale terrain information extracted from environmental surfaces, management records, and remotely sensed data. Using three machine learning methods, we compared models of forest productivity and evaluate the gain and Shapley values for interpreting the influence of categorical variables on the power of these methods to predict forest productivity at a landscape level. The most accurate model identified that the most important drivers of productivity were, in order of importance, genetics, environmental conditions, leaf area index, topology, and soil properties, thus describing the complex interactions of the forest. This approach demonstrates that new methods in remote sensing and data science enable powerful, landscape-level understanding of forest productivity. The phenotyping method developed here can be used to identify superior and inferior genotypes and estimate a productivity index for individual site. This approach can improve tree breeding and deployment of the right genetics to the right site in order to increase the overall productivity across planted forests.

T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to construct virtual land environment for virtual test, we propose a construction method of virtual land environment using multi-satellite remote sensing data, the key step of which is accurate recognition of ground object. In this paper, a method of ground object recognition based on hyperspectral image (HSI) was proposed, i.e., a HSI classification method based on information measure and convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined with spatial-spectral information. Firstly, the most important three spectra of the hyperspectral image was selected based on information measure. Specifically, the entropy and color-matching functions were applied to determine the candidate spectra sets from all the spectra of the hyperspectral image. Then three spectra with the largest amount of information were selected through the minimum mutual information. Through the above two steps, the dimensionality reduction for hyperspectral images was effectively achieved. Based on the three selected spectra, the CNN network input combined with the spatial-spectral information was designed. Two input strategies were designed: (1) The patch surrounding the pixel to be classified was directly intercepted from the grayscale images of the three selected spectra. (2) In order to highlight the effect of the spectrum of the pixel to be classified, all the spectral components of this pixel were superimposed on the patch obtained by the previous strategy. As a result, a new patch with more prominent spectral components of the pixel to be classified was obtained. Using the two public hyperspectral datasets, Salinas and Pavia Center, the experiments of on both parameter selection and classification performance were performed to verify that the proposed methods had better classification performance.

TI  - Can a machine-learning model improve the prediction of nodal stage after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer?
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The current standard for evaluating axillary nodal burden in clinically node negative breast cancer is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, the accuracy of SLNB to detect nodal stage N2-3 remains debatable. Nomograms can help the decision-making process between axillary treatment options. The aim of this study was to create a new model to predict the nodal stage N2-3 after a positive SLNB using machine learning methods that are rarely seen in nomogram development. Material and methods: Primary breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) between 2012 and 2017 formed cohorts for nomogram development (training cohort, N = 460) and for nomogram validation (validation cohort, N = 70). A machine learning method known as the gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) was used to determine the variables associated with nodal stage N2-3 and to create a predictive model. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for comparison. Results: The best combination of variables associated with nodal stage N2-3 in XGBoost modeling included tumor size, histological type, multifocality, lymphovascular invasion, percentage of ER positive cells, number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and number of positive SLNs multiplied by tumor size. Indicating discrimination, AUC values for the training cohort and the validation cohort were 0.80 (95%CI 0.71-0.89) and 0.80 (95%CI 0.65-0.92) in the XGBoost model and 0.85 (95%CI 0.77-0.93) and 0.75 (95%CI 0.58-0.89) in the logistic regression model, respectively. Conclusions: This machine learning model was able to maintain its discrimination in the validation cohort better than the logistic regression model. This indicates advantages in employing modern artificial intelligence techniques into nomogram development. The nomogram could be used to help identify nodal stage N2-3 in early breast cancer and to select appropriate treatments for patients.

TI  - Geometric distortion and mixed pixel elimination via TDYWT image enhancement for precise spatial measurement to avoid land survey error modeling
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, land cover classification of vegetation and water area from satellite image play a vital role for rural and urban planning and development. Existing algorithms of land cover classification require more sample image datasets for training. For existing algorithms, land cover classification of vegetation and water area is a challenging task because of mixed pixel and geometric distortion over boundary and curvature region. Mixed pixel affects the precise classification and measurement of land cover. Geometric distortion arises due to frame of isotropic and angular selectivity during image acquisition and affects the contour of land cover. In this paper, the proposed transverse dyadic wavelet transform (TDyWT) enhances and classifies vegetation and water area in land cover from LANDSAT image without training datasets. The proposed TDyWT uses Haar wavelet for decomposition and Burt 5 x 7 wavelet for reconstruction. The TDyWT enhances the contour, curvature, and boundary of vegetation and water area in LANDSAT image due to reversible and lifting properties of wavelet. TDyWT removes geometric distortion and spatial scale error of mixed pixel. In traditional land surveying spatial scale error reduction eliminates through total station and error modeling techniques. From the results, the proposed TDyWT algorithm classifies the area of subclass of vegetation and water with the 95% of accuracy with respect to ground truth survey methods.

TI  - Modeling the spatial variation of urban land surface temperature in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors: a case study of Tehran, Iran
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variation of Urban Land Surface Temperature (ULST) is a complex function of environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic factors. It thus requires specific techniques to quantify this phenomenon and its influencing factors. In this study, four models, Random Forest (RF), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are calibrated to simulate the ULST based on independent factors, i.e., land use/land cover (LULC), solar radiation, altitude, aspect, distance to major roads, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Additionally, the spatial influence and the main interactions among the influential factors of the ULST are explored. Landsat-8 is the main source for data extraction and Tehran metropolitan area in Iran is selected as the study area. Results show that NDVI, LULC, and altitude explained 86% of the ULST degrees C variation. Unexpectedly, lower LST is observed near the major roads, which was due to the presence of vegetation along the streets and highways in Tehran. The results also revealed that variation in the ULST was influenced by the interaction between altitude - NDVI, altitude - road, and LULC - altitude. This indicates that the individual examination of the underlying factors of the ULST variation might be unilluminating. Performance evaluation of the four models reveals a close performance in which their R-2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) fall between 60.6-62.1% and 2.56-2.60 degrees C, respectively. However, the difference between the models is not statistically significant. This study evaluated the predictive performance of several models for ULST simulation and enhanced our understanding of the spatial influence and interactions among the underlying driving forces of the ULST variations.

TI  - Rapid Recognition of Field-Grown Wheat Spikes Based on a Superpixel Segmentation Algorithm Using Digital Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat spike number, which could be rapidly and accurately estimated by the image processing technology, serves as the basis for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction. In this research, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) was performed for superpixel segmentation of the digital images of field-grown wheat. Firstly, certain characteristic color parameters were extracted and analyzed from the digital images, and the classifiers with the highest accuracy were chosen for subsequent image classification. Next, the main body of wheat spike was extracted through a series of morphological transformation and estimate was performed for each region. Backbone of the head was extracted, and the number of inflection points of backbone was detected. Then the wheat spike number was determined by combining the estimate of inflection points of backbone and the estimate for each region. Finally, the wheat spike number estimate was verified under four nitrogen fertilizer levels. The results were as follows: (1) Super green value (Eg) and normalized red green index (Dgr) were used as classification features to recognize wheat spikes, soil and leaves; (2) compared with pixel-based image processing, wheat spike recognition effect was much better after superpixel segmentation, as the main body of wheat spike extracted was more clear and morphology more intact; and (3) wheat plants had better growth under high nitrogen fertilizer level, and the accuracy of wheat spike number estimation was also the highest, which was 94.01%. The growth status was the worst under no nitrogen fertilizer application, and the accuracy of wheat spikes number estimation was also the lowest, which was only 80.8%. After excluding the no nitrogen condition, the accuracy of wheat spikes number estimation among mixed samples with more uniform growth status was up to 93.8%, which was an increase by 10.1% than before the exclusion. Wheat spikes number estimate based on superpixel segmentation and color features was a rapid and accurate method that was applicable to the field environment. However, this method was not recommended for use when the growth status of wheat was poor or of high heterogeneity. The findings provided reference for field-grown wheat yield estimate.

TI  - Extending the range of applicability of the semi-empirical ecosystem flux model PRELES for varying forest types and climate
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of ecosystem flux models on large geographical scales are often limited by model complexity and data availability. Here we calibrated and evaluated a semi-empirical ecosystem flux model, PREdict Light-use efficiency, Evapotranspiration and Soil water (PRELES), for various forest types and climate conditions, based on eddy covariance data from 55 sites. A Bayesian approach was adopted for model calibration and uncertainty quantification. We applied the site-specific calibrations and multisite calibrations to nine plant functional types (PFTs) to obtain the site-specific and PFT-specific parameter vectors for PRELES. A systematically designed cross-validation was implemented to evaluate calibration strategies and the risks in extrapolation. The combination of plant physiological traits and climate patterns generated significant variation in vegetation responses and model parameters across but not within PFTs, implying that applying the model without PFT-specific parameters is risky. But within PFT, the multisite calibrations performed as accurately as the site-specific calibrations in predicting gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Moreover, the variations among sites within one PFT could be effectively simulated by simply adjusting the parameter of potential light-use efficiency (LUE), implying significant convergence of simulated vegetation processes within PFT. The hierarchical modelling of PRELES provides a compromise between satellite-driven LUE and physiologically oriented approaches for extrapolating the geographical variation of ecosystem productivity. Although measurement errors of eddy covariance and remotely sensed data propagated a substantial proportion of uncertainty or potential biases, the results illustrated that PRELES could reliably capture daily variations of GPP and ET for contrasting forest types on large geographical scales if PFT-specific parameterizations were applied.

TI  - Optimisation and field validation of odour-baited traps for surveillance of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> adults in Paramaribo, Suriname
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Emerging arboviral diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya that are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, are increasingly threatening human health. Blends of human-like synthetic chemical attractants can be used to attract host-seeking mosquitoes. The aim of this study was to test new combinations of traps and odour baits in the laboratory, followed by testing the best candidates in the field to improve Ae. aegypti monitoring and surveillance. Methods First, the BG-Suna trap was evaluated for capturing laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti by testing normal and inverted positions in screen cage tests. Secondly, the attractiveness of the MB5 blend, CO2, and their combination was tested. Thirdly, we tested the attractiveness of different trap types (BG-Suna, BG-Sentinel, MM-X and CDC light trap). Finally, we confirmed laboratory results in the field in Paramaribo, Suriname, using the MB5 and BG-Lure odour blends, CO2 and the BG-Sentinel and BG-Bowl trap using a Latin Square design. Results The MB5 blend in combination with CO2 outperformed traps baited only with CO2 or MB5 in screen cage tests (P < 0.0001). The BG-Sentinel trap performed equally well as the inverted BG-Suna and was taken to the field (P = 0.729). In the field, we captured Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. nigripalpus. We confirmed the laboratory results and found that the combination of the MB5 blend and CO2 almost doubled Ae. aegypti female captures (P = 0.004) and more than doubled Culex spp. female captures (P = 0.005) compared to using only CO2. Interestingly, the MB5 blend outperformed the commercially available BG-Lure, in the BG-Sentinel (P < 0.001). The BG-Bowl also attracted Ae. aegypti when baited with the MB5 blend in similar numbers as the BG-Sentinel baited with the MB5 (P = 0.362). Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the BG-Sentinel trap baited with the MB5 blend and CO2 outperforms the current golden standard (BG-Sentinel trap with BG-Lure) for monitoring Ae. aegypti females and males, in both laboratory and field experiments. The BG-Bowl baited with the MB5 blend is a good candidate for home use. Finally, the results show that CO2 is an indispensable component of the attractive blend.

TI  - Increasing the spatial resolution of cloud property retrievals from Meteosat SEVIRI by use of its high-resolution visible channel: evaluation of candidate approaches with MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents and evaluates several candidate approaches for downscaling observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in order to increase the horizontal resolution of subsequent cloud optical thickness (tau) and effective droplet radius (r(eff)) retrievals from the native approximate to 3km x 3km spatial resolution of the narrowband channels to approximate to 1km x 1km. These methods make use of SEVIRI's coincident broadband high-resolution visible (HRV) channel. For four example cloud fields, the reliability of each downscaling algorithm is evaluated by means of collocated 1km x 1km MODIS radiances, which are reprojected to the horizontal grid of the HRV channel and serve as reference for the evaluation. By using these radiances, smoothed with the modulation transfer function of the native SEVIRI channels, as retrieval input, the accuracy at the SEVIRI standard resolution can be evaluated and an objective comparison of the accuracy of the different downscaling algorithms can be made. For the example scenes considered in this study, it is shown that neglecting high-frequency variations below the SEVIRI standard resolution results in significant random absolute deviations of the retrieved tau and reff of up to approximate to 14 and approximate to 6 mu m, respectively, as well as biases. By error propagation, this also negatively impacts the reliability of the subsequent calculation of liquid water path (W-L) and cloud droplet number concentration (N-D), which exhibit deviations of up to approximate to 89 gm(-2) and approximate to 177cm(-3), respectively. For tau, these deviations can be almost completely mitigated by the use of the HRV channel as a physical constraint and by applying most of the presented downscaling schemes. Uncertainties in retrieved r(eff) at the native SEVIRI resolution are smaller, and the improvements from downscaling the observations are less obvious than for tau. Nonetheless, the right choice of downscaling scheme yields noticeable improvements in the retrieved r(eff). Furthermore, the improved reliability in retrieved cloud products results in significantly reduced uncertainties in derived W-L and N-D. In particular, one downscaling approach provides clear improvements for all cloud products compared to those obtained from SEVIRI's standard resolution and is recommended for future downscaling endeavors. This work advances efforts to mitigate impacts of scale mismatches among channels of multiresolution instruments on cloud retrievals.

TI  - Deep learning radiomics can predict axillary lymph node status in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in patients with early-stage breast cancer is important for determining appropriate axillary treatment options and therefore avoiding unnecessary axillary surgery and complications. Here, we report deep learning radiomics (DLR) of conventional ultrasound and shear wave elastography of breast cancer for predicting ALN status preoperatively in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical parameter combined DLR yields the best diagnostic performance in predicting ALN status between disease-free axilla and any axillary metastasis with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.902 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.843, 0.961) in the test cohort. This clinical parameter combined DLR can also discriminate between low and heavy metastatic burden of axillary disease with AUC of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.814, 0.996) in the test cohort. Our study offers a noninvasive imaging biomarker to predict the metastatic extent of ALN for patients with early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Sextic centrifugal distortion constants: interplay of density functional and basis set for accurate yet feasible computations
T2  - MOLECULAR PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantum-chemical calculations assist the analysis of laboratory spectra, and often provide the only means to determine spectroscopic data that cannot be accessed experimentally. Accurate predictions of vibrational and rotational spectroscopic parameters are required for applications in the field of high-resolution molecular spectroscopy. While the accuracy issue of the quantum-chemical calculation of vibrational properties and of equilibrium structures has been addressed in the literature, the same is not true for centrifugal distortion constants that however play an essential role for the interpretation of remote sensing data. In this work, the performance of several model chemistries, rooted mainly in density functional theory, in computing sextic centrifugal distortion constants is assessed employing a benchmark set of molecules of both atmospheric and astrochemical relevance. The Jensen's (aug-)pcs-n basis sets, different flavours of Dunning's triple-zeta basis sets and the SNSD basis set, are employed in conjunction with different functionals, and their predictions are benchmarked against experimental and theoretical data at the coupled cluster level of theory. This study also demonstrates the reliability of the calculation of sextic centrifugal distortion constants within the Gaussian16 rev. B.01 program package. Reliable predictions of the sextic centrifugal distortion constants for the gauche- and trans-conformers of ethyl-mercaptan are also presented.

TI  - Potential of high resolution satellite optical imagery to detect damages following extreme rainfall events
T2  - LHB-HYDROSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Combination of numerous satellite data has lately become available to cover large areas with very high spatial resolution (VHR) and high revisit frequency. Little studies have yet made use of these images to assess and map damages following an extreme rainfall event, in particular those caused by rainwater runoff. We therefore investigate a specific approach to detect these damages as exhaustively as possible from VHR and HR satellite data acquired as closely as possible before and after an intense rainfall event. To do so, we used Pleiades (0.7 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m) images taken over the Aude region (France) which was heavily affected by a severe storm on October 15th, 2018. We chose to focus on agricultural lands as 1119 claims for agricultural disaster were registered and certified following this event. Post-event VHR Pleiades images were used to identify claimed damages over a subset of agricultural plots as well as to determine contextual information such as the type of damage (erosion, deposit, uprooting). Several indices and spectral filters were then applied to the selected areas from pre and post-event Sentinel-2 images. This exploratory work reveals that certain types of agricultural damage are well detected while others, albeit clearly visible on Pleiades images, are harder to identify with the selected indices and filters on Sentinel-2 images. It also shows the potential of this approach to discriminate the extent of damage that was declared over agricultural areas. This study emphasizes how relevant the use of combined spectral, temporal and contextual information is to detect damages following an extreme rainfall event, in particular those caused by rainwater runoff, thanks to optical imagery, as spectral knowledge alone does not appear to be sufficient. This preliminary work paves the way for further work based on the development of more advanced change detection methods, clues and filters as well as artificial intelligence.

TI  - Microbial enhanced oil recovery through deep profile control using a conditional bacterial cellulose-producing strain derived from <i>Enterobacter</i> sp. FY-07
T2  - MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Heterogeneity of oil-bearing formations is one of major contributors to low oil recovery efficiency globally. Long-term water flooding will aggravate this heterogeneity by resulting in many large channels during the exploitation process. Thus, injected water quickly flows through these large channels rather than oil-bearing areas, which ultimately leads to low oil recovery. This problem can be solved by profile control using polymer plugging. However, non-deep profile control caused by premature plugging is the main challenge. Here, a conditional bacterial cellulose-producing strain, namely Enterobacter sp. FY-0701, was constructed for deep profile control to solve the problem of premature plugging. Its deep profile control and oil displacement capabilities were subsequently identified and assessed. Results The conditional bacterial cellulose-producing strain Enterobacter sp. FY-0701 was constructed by knocking out a copy of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBP) encoding gene in Enterobacter sp. FY-07. Scanning electron microscope observation showed this strain produced bacterial cellulose using glucose rather than glycerol as the sole carbon source. Bacterial concentration and cellulose production at different locations in core experiments indicated that the plugging position of FY-0701 was deeper than that of FY-07. Moreover, enhanced oil recovery by FY-0701 was 12.09%, being 3.86% higher than that by FY-07 in the subsequent water flooding process. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of conditional biopolymer-producing strains used in microbial enhance oil recovery (MEOR). Our results demonstrated that the conditional bacterial cellulose-producing strain can in situ produce biopolymer far from injection wells and plugs large channels, which increased the sweep volume of injection water and enhance oil recovery. The construction of this strain provides an alternative strategy for using biopolymers in MEOR.

TI  - AMPK, a Regulator of Metabolism and Autophagy, Is Activated by Lysosomal Damage via a Novel Galectin-Directed Ubiquitin Signal Transduction System
T2  - MOLECULAR CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - AMPK is a central regulator of metabolism and autophagy. Here we show how lysosomal damage activates AMPK. This occurs via a hitherto unrecognized signal transduction system whereby cytoplasmic sentinel lectins detect membrane damage leading to ubiquitination responses. Absence of Galectin 9 (Gal9) or loss of its capacity to recognize lumenal glycans exposed during lysosomal membrane damage abrogate such ubiquitination responses. Proteomic analyses with APEX2-Gal9 have revealed global changes within the Gal9 interactome during lysosomal damage. Gal9 association with lysosomal glycoproteins increases whereas interactions with a newly identified Gal9 partner, deubiquitinase USP9X, diminishes upon lysosomal injury. In response to damage, Gal9 displaces USP9X from complexes with TAK1 and promotes K63 ubiquitination of TAK1 thus activating AMPK on damaged lysosomes. This triggers autophagy and contributes to autophagic control of membrane-damaging microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, galectin and ubiquitin systems converge to activate AMPK and autophagy during endomembrane homeostasis.

TI  - Comparing canopy height estimates from satellite-based photogrammetry, airborne laser scanning and field measurements across Australian production and conservation eucalypt forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) generates accurate data for calculating forest metrics, such as canopy height, yet can be cost-prohibitive. Satellite-based stereo pair photogrammetry has the potential to overcome this limitation of ALS to facilitate multi-temporal change analysis when ALS data capture is unfeasible; however, it remains largely untested across Australian conservation and production eucalypt forests. This study examined root-mean-square differences (RMSD) between canopy height measurements derived from ALS, field measurements and satellite-based photogrammetry for a spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora) plantation and scribbly gum (Eucalyptus racemosa) woodland in south-east Queensland, Australia. The comparison found satellite-based photogrammetry under predicted canopy height compared to field measurements and ALS, whilst the RMSD indicated low performance for satellite-based photogrammetry across the eucalypt plantation and woodland. The open and heterogenous forest structure typical in eucalypt forests combined with low point cloud density for photogrammetry to inadequately sample the canopy and increase stereo matching errors; which was exacerbated across the open and heterogenous scribbly gum woodland. Current satellite-based photogrammetry is therefore unlikely to provide a viable alternative to ALS when analysing canopy height across eucalypt forests at high-resolution. General surface analysis across large areas of eucalypt forest at moderate resolution, or airborne photogrammetric methods, could demonstrate increased viability as an alternative to ALS.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in suspended sediments over the inner shelf of the East China Sea with the effect of oceanic fronts
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediments are important contributors to the material exchanges between the sea surface and bottom and between the coastal waters and shelf seas. The East China Sea (ECS), connecting the Chinese continent and the western Pacific, receives a large amount of Yangtze River-delivered sediments. However, due to the climate change and intense human activities in recent years, the amount of Yangtze River-delivered sediment decreased by two thirds. Fewer work has been conducted on the accompanying changes of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) over the inner shelf of the ECS. Thus, in this study, based on the long-term water temperature, salinity, and SSC data derived from MODIS during 2003-2018, the spatiotemporal variations of SSC and the effects from oceanic fronts were studied. The results indicated a typical seasonal change of the SSC with the effect of a thermocline in summer and thermal-saline front in winter, respectively. Regarding the long-term variation of the SSC from 2003 to 2018, it displayed significant differences in spatial distribution. The SSC anomaly exhibited the opposite phases between the north and south parts of 28-29 degrees N and between the landside and seaside of the front at the isobaths of 20 m-40 m along the Zhe-Min Coast. In general, wind is the controlling factor that affects the SSC in most area of the Zhe-Min coast, especially in spring and winter seasons.

TI  - Beyond Simplifications: Making Sense of Paradoxical Chinese Values in Chinese-Western Business Negotiations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has drawn attention to the coexistence of paradoxical Chinese values in modern China, which might influence Chinese-Western business negotiations. In this study, we empirically investigate this phenomenon from the perspective of Western business negotiators. In two interview rounds, 17 seasoned Dutch negotiators were asked about their experiences when negotiating with Chinese business partners. The results confirm the coexistence of paradoxical Chinese values in business negotiations and identify four patterns in which traditional and modern values may occur: random, contextual, transitional, and simultaneous occurrence. On the basis of our findings, we argue that there is a need for Western negotiators to develop a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and paradoxical values from the Chinese worldview of Yin and Yang.

TI  - Geometric accuracy assessment of coarse-resolution satellite datasets: a study based on AVHRR GAC data at the sub-pixel level
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) data provide daily global coverage of the Earth, which are widely used for global environmental and climate studies. However, their geolocation accuracy has not been comprehensively evaluated due to the difficulty caused by onboard resampling and the resulting coarse resolution, which hampers their usefulness in various applications. In this study, a correlation-based patch matching method (CPMM) was proposed to characterize and quantify the geo-location accuracy at the sub-pixel level for satellite data with coarse resolution, such as the AVHRR GAC dataset. This method is neither limited to landmarks nor suffers from errors caused by false detection due to the effect of mixed pixels caused by a coarse spatial resolution, and it thus enables a more robust and comprehensive geometric assessment than existing approaches. Data of NOAA-17, MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites were selected to test the geocoding accuracy. The three satellites predominately present west shifts in the across-track direction, with average values of -1.69, -1.9, 2.56 km and standard deviations of 1.32, 1.1, 2.19 km for NOAA-17, MetOp-A, and MetOp-B, respectively. The large shifts and uncertainties are partly induced by the larger satellite zenith angles (SatZs) and partly due to the terrain effect, which is related to SatZ and becomes apparent in the case of large SatZs. It is thus suggested that GAC data with SatZs less than 40ffi should be preferred in applications. The along-track geolocation accuracy is clearly improved compared to the across-track direction, with average shifts of -0.7, -0.02 and -0.96 km and standard deviations of 1.01, 0.79 and 1.70 km for NOAA-17, MetOp-A and MetOp-B, respectively. The data can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.5676/DWD/ESA_Cloud_cci/AVHRR-AM/V002 (Stengel et al., 2017) and https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD13A1.006 (Didan, 2015).

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of the soil erosion cover-management factor for China's Loess Plateau
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cover-management factor (C-factor) is used in the revised universal soil loss equation to represent the effect of vegetation cover and its management practices on hillslope erosion. Remote sensing has been widely used to estimate vegetation cover and the C-factor, but most previous studies only used the photosynthetic vegetation (PV) or green vegetation indices (VI, e.g., normalized difference VI) for estimating the C-factor and the important non-PV (NPV) component was often ignored. In this study, we developed a new technique to estimate monthly time-series C-factor using the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) including both PV and NPV, and weighted by monthly rainfall erosivity ratio. The monthly FVC was derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and LANDSAT data with field validation. We conducted the case-study over China's Loess Plateau and analysed the spatiotemporal variations of FVC and the C-factor and their impacts on erosion over the Plateau. Our study reveals a significant increase in total vegetation cover (TC) from 56 to 76.8%, with a mean of 71.2%, resulting in about 20% decrease in the C-factor and erosion risk during the 17-year period. Our method has an advantage in estimating the C-factor from TC at a monthly scale providing a basis for continuously and consistently monitoring of vegetation cover, erosion risk and climate impacts.

TI  - Rangeland canopy cover estimation using Landsat OLI data and vegetation indices in Sabalan rangelands, Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation canopy cover is an important biophysical indicator for monitoring rangeland condition and rangeland management. The main purpose of this study is to assess the capability of Landsat 8 (OLI) image-derived vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate the vegetation canopy cover (CC) in Sablan rangelands. Field CC measurement was performed using the transect-quadrats method in 12 selected sites on the study area according to three vegetation life-forms canopy cover including, Forbs (FCC), Grasses (GCC), and Shrubs (SHCC) along with a combination of three life-forms as Total canopy cover (TCC). The estimated CCs were correlated and regressed with Landsat OLI reflectance values and vegetation indices. Results revealed that all the slope-based, distance-based, and orthogonal transformation VIs had the highest significant correlations with Grass canopy cover data (mean of R-2 = 0.70) at the 95% confidence level. The weakest and insignificant correlations were derived for FCC followed by SHCC. A number of VIs (with mean R-2 = 0.6) significantly correlated with TCC. The results of linear regression for GCC, TCC, and SHCC indicated that the reflectance values of spectral bands and vegetation indices were convincingly regressed with CC field data having R-2 values in the range of 0.72 to 0.83, while the FCC due to the third-order logarithmic regression models gained the weakest relationship with spectral data and also VIs (R-2 = 0.14 and 0.42, respectively). Results of validity test of the regression models declared that the models developed for SHCC are the best predictors followed by those made for TCC, GCC, and FCC, respectively. In this study, there was not observed an obvious difference between the performances of the three groups of VIs in predicting the CC of life-forms in the studied sites. It can be concluded that the studied VIs are more strong predictors of Grass canopy cover as the dominant life-form.

TI  - The seasonal evolution of albedo across glaciers and the surrounding landscape of Taylor Valley, Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica are a polar desert ecosystem consisting of alpine glaciers, ice-covered lakes, streams, and expanses of vegetation-free rocky soil. Because average summer temperatures are close to 0 degrees C, the MDV ecosystem in general, and glacier melt dynamics in particular, are both closely linked to the energy balance. A slight increase in incoming radiation or change in albedo can have large effects on the timing and volume of meltwater. However, the seasonal evolution or spatial variability of albedo in the valleys has yet to fully characterized. In this study, we aim to understand the drivers of landscape albedo change within and across seasons. To do so, a box with a camera, GPS, and shortwave radiometer was hung from a helicopter that flew transects four to five times a season along Taylor Valley. Measurements were repeated over three seasons. These data were coupled with incoming radiation measured at six meteorological stations distributed along the valley to calculate the distribution of albedo across individual glaciers, lakes, and soil surfaces. We hypothesized that albedo would decrease throughout the austral summer with ablation of snow patches and increasing sediment exposure on the glacier and lake surfaces. However, small snow events (< 6 mm water equivalent) coupled with ice whitening caused spatial and temporal variability of albedo across the entire landscape. Glaciers frequently followed a pattern of increasing albedo with increasing elevation, as well as increasing albedo moving from east to west laterally across the ablation zone. We suggest that spatial patterns of albedo are a function of landscape morphology trapping snow and sediment, longitudinal gradients in snowfall magnitude, and wind-driven snow redistribution from east to west along the valley. We also compare our albedo measurements to the MODIS albedo product and found that overall the data have reasonable agreement. The mismatch in spatial scale between these two datasets results in variability, which is reduced after a snow event due to albedo following valley-scale gradients of snowfall magnitude. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal variability in albedo and the close coupling of climate and landscape response. This new understanding of landscape albedo can constrain landscape energy budgets, better predict meltwater generation on from MDV glaciers, and how these ecosystems will respond to changing climate at the landscape scale.

TI  - Research on Quantitative Remote Sensing Monitoring Algorithm of Air Pollution Based on Artificial Intelligence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - When the current algorithm is used for quantitative remote sensing monitoring of air pollution, it takes a long time to monitor the air pollution data, and the obtained range coefficient is small. The error between the monitoring result and the actual result is large, and the monitoring efficiency is low, the monitoring range is small, and the monitoring accuracy rate is low. An artificial intelligence-based quantitative monitoring algorithm for air pollution is proposed. The basic theory of atmospheric radiation transmission is analyzed by atmospheric radiation transfer equation, Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law, parallel plane atmospheric radiation theory, atmospheric radiation transmission model, and electromagnetic radiation transmission model. Quantitative remote sensing monitoring of air pollution provides relevant information. The simultaneous equations are constructed on the basis of multiband satellite remote sensing data through pixel information, and the aerosol turbidity of the atmosphere is calculated by the equation decomposition of the pixel information. The quantitative remote sensing monitoring of air pollution is realized according to the calculated aerosol turbidity. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high monitoring efficiency, wide monitoring range, and high monitoring accuracy.

TI  - Ubuntu diplomacy: Broadening soft power in an African context
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ubuntu is an African philosophical worldview that has increasingly gained prominence since South Africa's democratic transition in 1994. It places emphasis on the world's common humanity and its consequent interdependence. Through content analysis, the article examines the soft power that is inherent in South Africa's foreign policy, as codified in the 2011White Paper on South African Foreign Policy-Building a Better World: Diplomacy of Ubuntu. In its findings, the article established a distinction between Joseph Nye's original conceptualization of soft power, formulated from a United States realist foreign policy perspective, and the one inherent in South Africa's humanist foreign policy guided by the philosophy of Ubuntu. This distinction is premised on the geopolitical disparities between the two nations. The article further examines South Africa's wielding of soft power within the African continent, the first audience of the country's diplomacy of Ubuntu.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological variations, circular spectral anomalies, geological structures such as folds, faults, lineaments and shear zones of Kutch sedimentary basin were interpreted using IRS-LISS III satellite data. Aeromagnetic data was also interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively and a number of anomalous magnetic zones, faults, lineaments and domal structures were mapped. Magnetic basement depths and thickness of sediments were also computed. A number of alternate basement ridges/highs/uplifted blocks and depressions/lows/downthrown blocks were delineated. The information obtained from satellite remote sensing and aeromagnetic data were then integrated and the results were compared with published literature on gravity, magnetic (ground), magnetotelluric and seismic data, and also with field geology and well data. Structural controls in spatial domain (latitude, longitude and depth) were derived by establishing spatial relationship among different geological structures with reference to the geological time scale. Numerous horst and graben structures (ridges and sub-basins) as well as a number of master faults were delineated which serve as vital information with regard to hydrocarbon prospects and earthquake vulnerability, respectively. Based on the information obtained from this integrated study, a conceptual tectonometamorphic model along with sedimentation and igneous activity (ophiolitic and basaltic) has been constructed which has a significant bearing on the sequence of events that occurred during the deformational history of Kutch sedimentary basin resulting into the present day tectonic configuration.

TI  - Modeling litter mass using satellite NDVI images and environmental variables in a brutian pine forest located in the southwest of Turkey
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Litter mass (LM) on the forest floor is an important component of the carbon (C) cycle in forest ecosystems. A considerably amount of LM is accumulated in the conifer forests in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. Therefore, LM should be considered to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) more accurately in these forests. Rapid and affordable methods are necessary for LM inventory. Satellite remote sensing data and GIS-based environmental variables, which cover broad geographic regions, are alternative data sources in this scope. In this work, the LM was modeled by means of generalized additive model (GAM) using the predictor variables including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images (derived from RapidEye, SPOT-5, Aster) and environmental data (heat index-HI and radiation index-RI). According to the cross validation test, the best model using NDVIASTER and HI as predictor variables explained a total variation of 49% of the LM as response variable. We may conclude that the LM on the floor of brutian pine stands can be moderately predicted using satellite data and environmental variables. We consider that the results of this study may contribute to estimation of AGB and C storages more accurately in pure brutian pine stands.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL

AB  - This work comprises combining the passive radiometer (SMAP) and active scatterometer (ASCAT) remotely sensed surface soil moisture datasets by employing cumulative distributive frequency matching algorithm using second-order polynomial regression for the Indo-Gangetic basin by keeping GLDAS-NOAH as the reference dataset for the period 2015-2016. In order to evaluate the quality, utility and applicability of the combined soil moisture product for a macro river basin, it is further downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution using the universal triangle algorithm. The acceptable ranges of correlation coefficients (0.6-0.75 and 0.5-0.75 between derived soil moisture product with precipitation and the ground soil moisture data, respectively) indicate an interdependency between the surface soil moisture and precipitation and validate the data product too. The results have also shown satisfactory correlation coefficient and RMSE in the range 0.7-0.85 between derived downscaled product and the active-passive soil moisture product, SMAP/Sentinel-1.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the impacts of changing land use-land cover on the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) distribution in the Indian part of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve by utilizing remote sensing and geographical information system. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager images of the year 2000, 2010 and 2017, respectively, were used to assess the essential indicators for regional environmental health employing appropriate calibrations and corrections. It was observed that there has been a marked reduction in the areas of plantation, mangrove swamp, mangrove forests and agricultural land since 2000. In contrast, an increase in sand beach, waterlogged areas, mudflat, river, and agriculture area was observed. The mean NDVI values for mangrove forests and plantation have decreased from 0.441 to 0.229 and 0.266 to 0.195, respectively, while river, aquaculture, agricultural and open scrubs classes had higher values. The rate of increase in surface LST was highest over settlements, followed by sand beaches, mudflats, aquaculture, mangrove forest, river, plantations, waterlogged areas and agricultural field. LST showed a negative correlation with NDVI values probably due to the high rate of evapo-transpiration activities of the mangrove vegetations. All these above facts distinctly substantiates that there is an increase in open patches/non-vegetated cover and that the ecosystem is under constant stress.

TI  - Evaluation of cloud properties from reanalyses over East Asia with a radiance-based approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive observational and numerical investigations have been performed to better characterize cloud properties. However, due to the large variations in cloud spatiotemporal distributions and physical properties, quantitative depictions of clouds in different atmospheric reanalysis datasets are still highly uncertain. A radiance-based evaluation approach is introduced and performed to evaluate the quality of cloud properties from reanalysis datasets. The China Meteorological Administration reanalysis (CRA); the ECMWF fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5); and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), i.e., those reanalyses providing sufficient cloud information, are considered. To avoid the influence of assumptions and uncertainties on satellite retrieval algorithms, forward radiative transfer simulations are used as a bridge to translate the reanalyses to corresponding radiances that are expected to be observed by satellites. The simulated reflectances and brightness temperatures (BTs) are directly compared with observations from the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard the Himawari-8 satellite in the East Asia region. We find that the simulated reflectances and BTs based on CRA and ERA5 are close to each other. CRA represents the total and midlayer cloud cover better than the other two datasets, and ERA5 depicts deep-convection structures more closely than CRA does. Comparisons of the simulated and observed BT differences suggest that water clouds are generally overestimated in ERA5 and MERRA-2, and MERRA-2 also overestimates the ice clouds over cyclone centers. Overall, clouds from CRA, ERA5, and MERRA-2 show their own advantages in different aspects. The ERA5 reanalysis has the best capability to represent the cloudy atmospheres over East Asia, and the CRA representations are close to those in ERA5.

TI  - Mapping of native plant species and noxious weeds to investigate grassland degradation in the Three-River Headwaters region using HJ-1A/HSI imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterized by an alpine meadow, the ecological environment system in the ?Three-River Headwaters? region (TRHR) is considered to be a typical fragile ecological system. Numerous observations and research results have indicated that grassland degradation has occurred in the TRHR in recent years. However, research related to utilize the species information of grass communities to monitor grassland degradation remains rare. Therefore, the aim of this study is to produce the distribution maps of native plant species and noxious weeds to investigate grassland degradation for livestock farming perspective. In this study, the fused HJ-1A/HSI data was combined with field investigation samples to define the coverage of native plant species and noxious weeds at different coverage levels. Then, coverage distribution maps of native plant species and noxious weeds were produced by using support vector machine (SVM) classification and random forests (RF) regression methods. Meanwhile, the overall accuracy (OA) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of each coverage map were assessed. Finally, a grassland degradation map was derived according to the native plant species and noxious weeds cover information. The experimental results show that (1) the spectral feature of native plant species and noxious weeds can be distinguished based on field measurement spectra in the TRHR; (2) the fractional coverage of native plant species and noxious weeds can be relatively accurately estimated when coverage is divided into nine levels; (3) the grass coverage estimation accuracies of SVM classification are similar with these of RF regression method. The OAs of SVM classification are 69.7% at nine grassland coverage levels for native plant species and noxious weeds, and corresponding RMSEs are 8.2% and 8.0%, respectively; and (4) the coverage of native plant species is generally higher than that of the noxious weeds in the study area.

TI  - Future land use land cover prediction with special emphasis on urbanization and wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Manipur River basin lies in the northeastern part of India in the lesser Himalayan ranges and it is under extreme pressure from natural and anthropogenic factors. This study aims to monitor and predict the future land use land cover (LULC) for the region using land change modeller (LCM) in TerrSet. Landsat satellite images were used to produce LULC map for three different years 2007, 2014 and 2017. Based on these past LULC map, future LULC map of the study area was developed using Markov Chain and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis in LCM. ANN was trained with the driver variable, namely, distance from roads, distance from settlement, elevation and slope. Results indicate that there was an increase in area under waterbodies, agriculture and built-up area by 15.93%, 2.42% and 11.58%, respectively, in 2017 with respect to initial LULC condition in 2007. It can also be observed that there was decrease of 6.08%, 28.65% and 0.55% in wetlands, herbaceous wetlands and forest, respectively. Furthermore, similar trends were observed in the predicted LULC map of 2030 with an increase of 16.4%, 3.06% and 20.99% in waterbodies, agriculture and built-up area, and decrease of 6.48%, 41.56% and 1.4% in wetlands, herbaceous wetlands and forest. Based on the result of predicted LULC of 2030 which indicates drastic change in built-up area and herbaceous wetlands, there is a need for formulating proper urban planning and environmental preservation policies.

TI  - Innate lymphoid cells link gut microbes with mucosal T cell immunity
T2  - GUT MICROBES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite continuous exposure to trillions of microbes, the intestinal immune system protects the mucosa by balancing barrier protection, tolerance, and immunity. As both sentinel and effector, the mucosal innate immune system plays a central role in coordinating these responses. By integrating signals from the intestinal microbiota, mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) serve as a critical link in regulating effector functions of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Our recent work identified the role for MNP production of the IBD-linked protein TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A) in modulating microbial regulation of ILC3 barrier immunity. These findings highlight a broader role for ILC3s in local control of T cell immunity and their potential role in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory disease.

TI  - Multi-angular instrument for tower-based observations of canopy sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
T2  - INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is an important component in the global carbon cycle. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides remotely sensible signals for monitoring GPP. The angular distribution of SIF is heterogeneous. However, SIF is usually measured from one angle only, which may not represent the canopy-scale value. In this study, a ground-based system of multi-angle observation was used to measure the SIF over the growing season of a paddy rice. This system includes two spectrometers (Ocean Optics HR4000) with the identical conditions (i.e., full width at half maxima, slits, and grating) and a cooling system. This system can monitor SIF signals continuously over plant canopies. The SIF was measured at four viewing zenith angles (VZA = 32 degrees, 42 degrees, 52 degrees, and 62 degrees) with eleven view azimuth angles (VAA = 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, 150 degrees, 180 degrees, 210 degrees, 240 degrees, 300 degrees, 330 degrees, and 360 degrees, respectively). The ground observation of the SIF varied greatly with the angle of observation relative to the sun. The SIF values in the hotspot direction were higher (from 25% to 40%) than those in the non-hotspot direction, and the lowest SIF values appeared at the dark spot.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of <i>Leptospira</i> infection in urban brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), Vienna, Austria
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis is a worldwide bacterial zoonosis which incidence is expected to increase in conjunction with global change. In urban ecosystems, synanthropic rats are the key source of Leptospira infection in humans and other animals. Risk assessment and prediction of human leptospirosis require investigations of the environment associated with the bacteria and infection patterns in the reservoir hosts. The objective of this study was to address the prevalence of mixed Leptospira infection in the lungs and kidneys of brown rats captured in three sites of the city centre of Vienna, Austria, between 2016 and 2018. A total of 96 brown rats were examined for the presence of Leptospira using PCR. Occurrence of mixed Leptospira infections was explored through next-generation sequencing (NGS). A logistic regression model was built to predict the individual infection status using morphological and land-use data. Overall, the prevalence of Leptospira interrogans in the kidney was 25% but varied among sites (0-36%). We did not evidence any pulmonary nor mixed infections. Host body mass and sex were strong predictors of Leptospira carriage in the sampled rats (relative variable importance (RVI) = 0.98 and 0.89, respectively) while the presence of water affected it moderately (RVI = 0.44). Our findings demonstrate that NGS is an unbiased approach to the direct characterisation of mixed leptospiral infections that could provide further insights into the ecology of Leptospira. Future surveillance programmes should consider the use of rats as sentinels for the early detection of emerging pathogenic Leptospira in urban ecosystems.

TI  - Monitoring changes in land use and distribution of mangroves in the southeastern part of the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most valuable and productive coastal ecosystems. Previous studies show a severe loss of mangroves around the world over the last several decades due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Mangroves located in the southeastern part of the Mekong River Delta (MRD) are also affected by these activities. Shrimp farming is considered as one of the main drivers causing the rapid loss and degradation of mangroves. The goal of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal changes in land use and distribution of mangroves in the Soc Trang and Bac Lieu provinces of the southeastern part of the MRD. Multi-temporal Landsat data were used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using the maximum-likelihood classification algorithm. The changes in mangrove forest areas were monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager) satellite imageries from 1988 to 2018. In the study area, there were seven major LULC types namely, dense mangroves, sparse mangroves, aquaculture farms, arable land with crop cover, arable land without crop cover, settlements, and water bodies. The overall accuracies of the LULC maps in 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018 were 81.2%, 83.3%, 78.3%, and 81.9%, respectively. This study reveals that dense and sparse mangrove forests have decreased by 90% from 5495 hectares (ha) to 515 ha and by 55% from 14,105 to 6289 ha, respectively from 1988 to 2018. On the other hand, the aquaculture farm has increased at the rate of 5024 ha/year for a period of 30 years. This rapid growth of aquaculture farming activities caused the rapid loss and degradation of mangroves in the MRD. Quantitative information about mangrove change obtained by this study is considered to be useful for future coastal management and relevant policies in the MRD.

TI  - Determination of sensitivity of drainage morphometry towards hydrological response interactions for various datasets
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A network of drainage patterns and associated morphometric analysis are important as it forms various attributes of a watershed. Analysis of these attributes is carried out by spatial analysis which is essential for studying several hydrological response interactions within the watershed catchment area. In the present work, five stream networks of a head watershed Verakhadi were derived from SOI toposheet (scale = 1:50,000), SRTM-GL1, AW3D30, GDEM-V2 and CartoDEM-V3.1. The calculated basin morphometric attributes of drainage network derived from all four 30-m-resolution satellite-based DEMs were compared with SOI toposheet-based drainage network which is essential for estimating the accuracy of watershed hydrological response to a natural event (storm). The capability of all four satellite-based DEMs to represent linear, areal and relief aspect of the drainage basin was evaluated. Morphometric parameter comparison of stream network derived from various DEMs is an indirect way of assessing the relative vertical accuracy of DEM. It is observed that DEMs with same spatial resolution can have variable morphometry derivatives due to different data acquisition and data processing techniques used for DEM generation. The outcome of this study will help to understand the complexity and susceptibility of the various morphometric factors arises while dealing with different data acquisition and processing techniques. The study suggests that SRTM-GL1 performs better in terms of drainage delineation and basin morphometry, followed by AW3D30, CartoDEM-V3.1 and GDEM-V2 when compared with SOI toposheet-derived terrain attributes.

TI  - Surface water map of China for 2015 (SWMC-2015) derived from Landsat 8 satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale surface water mapping not only helps us protect, utilize and manage water resources but also contributes to the understanding of climate change and the hydrologic cycle. A recent study showed that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network is an effective method to identify various surface water types from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery. We use this method to produce a surface water map of China for 2015 (SWMC-2015) at a 30 m pixel size. The accuracy of SWMC-2015 was assessed with a set of random water and not water validation points. The strengths and limitations of SWMC-2015 include: the SWMC-2015 clearly shows the major lake clusters and river networks with high mapping accuracy and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of SWMC-2015 are 90% and 0.78, respectively. The accuracy of SWMC-2015 can be improved from perspective of training samples representation, verification sample seasonal fluctuation and mixed pixel. The SWMC-2015 is available for free download on the remote sensing of global change website (https://vapd.gitlab.io/post/swmc2015/).

T2  - EXPOSITORY TIMES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the conceptual encounter of coexisting worldviews in the lands around the Mediterranean through the concept of the oikoumene, 'the inhabited world'. Different cultures, such as the Roman and the Jewish, adopted the term, but distinctively adapted it around their own understanding. The result was a tension for early Christians between two parallel worldviews. The biblical authors considered it significant to elucidate the genuine Lord of the oikoumene, who was thus its centre. Luke employs the oikoumene in Luke-Acts and provides his own worldview, particularly, in Acts 17. Here he intends to suggest that the Roman oikoumene is to be gradually supplanted by the Christian oikoumene (17:6). At the same time, Luke claims that the Acts' narrative portrays the inhabited world where the early Christians lived as restored into the authentic world created and ruled by God through Jesus (17:31). Similarly, the inhabited world represented in Acts is the world that God designed all nations (God's offspring) to inhabit, and God has allotted the boundaries of the nations where the people are to dwell.

TI  - Improving leaf area index retrieval using spectral characteristic parameters and data splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral variables such as spectral characteristic parameters (SCPs) commonly change with intraday phenology. Empirical retrieval methods, which are generally used in leaf area index (LAI) retrieval due to their simplicity and computational efficiency, typically relate the biophysical parameter of interest to the spectral variable during the whole observation period. Whilst information regarding diurnal changes in spectral variables is necessary and useful in applied contexts. We analysed the diurnal change characteristics of canopy spectral reflectance and SCPs of winter wheat in the jointing stage based on field data collected at fixed sampling points with different vegetation canopies, and validated the effectiveness of data splitting strategy with field data collected in random sample pattern. The key results are as follows: (i) Canopy spectral reflectance of winter wheat in the jointing stage exhibited clear intraday variability, typically presenting a double-peak characteristic occurring from 11:35 to 12:34, where the reflectance changed substantively during this period. (ii) The SCPs of winter wheat in the jointing stage exhibited different diurnal patterns. Specifically, the blue edge position presented 'blue shifts', the yellow edge position generally exhibited steady fluctuations, and the red edge position followed divergent trends between the two sampling points due to differences in the vegetation canopy. Amplitude and area parameters exhibited a double-peak characteristic but there were slight differences between them. (iii) By dividing the whole observation period into sub-periods, the coefficient of variation (CV) of each spectral characteristic parameter can be greatly reduced, whilst the coefficient of determination (R-2) of LAI retrieval can be greatly increased. Optimal spectral parameters and sub-periods for LAI retrieval were confirmed based on the diurnal variation of SCPs. To optimize LAI retrieval the suggested spectral parameters are blue edge amplitude, red edge amplitude, and red edge area, and the sub-periods are 09:50-11:35, 11:35-12:34, 12:34-13:50, and 13:50-15:00, respectively. The 11:35-12:34 sub-period should be carefully considered due to possible midday depression of photosynthesis.

TI  - Improved cloud detection for Landsat 8 images using a combined neural network model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision cloud detection is a key step in the processing of remote sensing imagery. However, the existing cloud detection methods struggle to extract high-accuracy cloud pixels, especially for images of thin and fragmented clouds or those over high-brightness surfaces. In this study, we developed a new model by combining the existing models of Fully Convolutional Network-8 sample (FCN-8s) and U-network (U-net) (based on the three visible bands) to take full advantage of spectral and spatial information. In the proposed Fully Convolutional Network Ensembling Learning (FCNEL) model, U-net and FCN-8s initially conduct separate classifications based on their relative strengths, and their outputs are fused by the voting strategy to integrate multi-scale features from both the models. Different surface and cloud types in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data were used to test the model, which showed an average overall accuracy of 91.68% and an average producer accuracy of 98.52%. Thus, the proposed FCNEL model was superior to FCN-8s or U-net as well as the widely used function of mask algorithm. The proposed method has good adaptability to various cloud types and diverse underlying surface environments.

TI  - Big Data for a Big Country: The First Generation of Canadian Wetland Inventory Map at a Spatial Resolution of 10-m Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data on the Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on the spatial distribution of wetlands is crucial for sustainable management and resource assessment. Furthermore, regularly updated wetland inventories are of particular importance given that wetlands comprise a dynamic, rather than permanent, land condition. Accordingly, satellite-derived wetland maps are greatly beneficial, as they capture a synoptic and multi-temporal view of landscapes. Leveraging state-of-the-art remote sensing data and tools, this study produces a high-resolution 10-m wetland inventory map of Canada, covering an approximate area of one billion hectares, using multi-year, multi-source (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) Earth Observation (EO) data on the Google Earth Engine (TM) cloud computing platform. The whole country is mapped using a large volume of reference samples using an object-based random forest classification scheme with an overall accuracy approaching 80% and individual accuracies varying from 74% to 84% in different provinces. This nationwide wetland inventory map illustrates that 19% of Canada's land area is covered by wetlands, most of which are peatlands dominate in the northern ecozones. Importantly, the resulting ever-demanding wetland inventory map of Canada provides unprecedented details on the extent, status, and spatial distribution of wetlands and thus, is useful for many stakeholders, including federal and provincial governments, municipalities, NGOs, and environmental consultants.

TI  - A Framework for High-Resolution Soil Moisture Extraction Using SCATSAT-1 Scatterometer Data
T2  - IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving soil moisture with low-resolution data is quite a challenging task. For retrieving the soil moisture, knowledge of backscattered signal from bare soil and crop-covered soil is very much important, which is difficult to obtain from the low-resolution data. This problem may be solved by using optical data. Therefore, in this paper a novel approach is proposed to classify translucent and non-transparent vegetation areas using optical sensor data, which is further used in the estimation of soil moisture. The soil moisture product is then downscaled from 25 km to similar to 5.6 km using vegetation temperature condition index which is computed using MODIS data. Obtained results show that this approach is able to retrieve soil moisture successfully and is able to downscale soil moisture data into higher resolution product.

TI  - The role of vascular function on exercise capacity in health and disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
M3  - Review
AB  - Three sentinel parameters of aerobic performance are the maximal oxygen uptake ((V) over dot(2max)), critical power (CP) and speed of the (V) over dot(2max) kinetics following exercise onset. Of these, the latter is, perhaps, the cardinal test of integrated function along the O-2 transport pathway from lungs to skeletal muscle mitochondria. Fast. (V) over dot(2max) kinetics demands that the cardiovascular system distributes exercise-induced blood flow elevations among and within those vascular beds subserving the contracting muscle(s). Ideally, this process must occur at least as rapidly as mitochondrial metabolism elevates (V) over dot(2max). Chronic disease and ageing create an O-2 delivery (i.e. blood flow x arterial [O-2], (Q)over dot(2max)) dependency that slows (V) over dot(2max) kinetics, decreasing CP and (V) over dot(2max), increasing the O-2 deficit and sowing the seeds of exercise intolerance. Exercise training, in contrast, does the opposite. Within the context of these three parameters (seeGraphical Abstract), this brief review examines the training-induced plasticity of key elements in the O-2 transport pathway. It asks how structural and functional vascular adaptations accelerate and redistribute muscle. (Q) over dot(O2) and thus defend microvascular O-2 partial pressures and capillary blood-myocyte O-2 diffusion across a similar to 100-fold range of muscle. (V) over dot(O2) values. Recent discoveries, especially in the muscle microcirculation and. (Q) over dot(O2)-to-(V) over dot(O2) heterogeneity, are integrated with the O-2 transport pathway to appreciate how local and systemic vascular control helps defend. (V) over dot(O2) kinetics and determine CP and. (V) over dot(O2max) in health and how vascular dysfunction in disease predicates exercise intolerance. Finally, the latest evidence that nitrate supplementation improves vascular and therefore aerobic function in health and disease is presented.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of land cover from high resolution multispectral satellite images by spectral-spatial convolutional neural network
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Research to improve the accuracy of very high-resolution satellite image classification algorithms is still one of the hot topics in the field of remote sensing. Successful results of deep learning methods in areas such as image classification and object detection have led to the application of these methods to remote sensing problems. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the most common deep learning methods used in image classification, however, the use of CNN's in satellite image classification is relatively new. Due to the high computational complexity of 3D CNNs, which aim to extract both spatial and spectral information, 2D CNNs focussing on the extraction of spatial information are often preferred. High-resolution satellite images, however, contain crucial spectral information as well as spatial information. In this study, a 3D-2D CNN model using both spectral and spatial information was applied to extract more accurate land cover information from very high-resolution satellite images. The model was applied on a Worldview-2 satellite image including agricultural product areas such as tea, hazelnut groves and land use classes such as buildings and roads. The results of the CNN based model were also compared against those of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The post-classification accuracies were obtained using 800 control points generated by a web interface created for crowdsourcing purposes. The classification accuracy was 95.6% for the 3D-2D CNN model, 89.2% for the RF and 86.4% for the SVM.

Due to the lack of digital reference data of the test site, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was implemented to Sentinel-2 data and the classified image was utilized as reference data since previous studies proved that SVM classification provided better results than the thresholding methods. SVM classification results were evaluated using 1000 random points and the Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient were obtained 96.2% and 0.90, respectively. The thresholding methods were assessed using the statistical measures, namely OA, Kappa and Misclassification Error (ME). Considering the remote sensing perspective, all thresholding methods presented satisfying results having at least 92% OA for open water body extraction. The obtained accuracy results showed that minimum thresholding method was the best method among these fifteen algorithms with 0.000264 ME, 99.9355% OA and 0.9987 Kappa. On the other hand, p-tile and Shanbhag's thresholding method provided the worst accuracy results for open water body delineation.

TI  - Clay Mineral Alteration in Oil and Gas Fields: Integrated Analyses of Surface Expression, Soil Spectra, and X-Ray Diffraction Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface hydrocarbon occurrences can be detected by clay mineral (CM) alteration at the surface as a consequence of hydrocarbon migration. This study analyzed CM alteration in an oil and gas (O&G) field in the West Tugu field, located in the northwest Java Basin of Indonesia. Landsat 8 OLI data acquired on 25 September 2015 and soil spectral reflectance (SSR) data recorded using analytical spectral devices (ASD) in March 2017 were processed using clay indices to analyze CM alteration. Soil samples from a field survey of the same area were also analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify their CM compositions. CM distribution was empirically modeled by integrating the SSR bands re-sampled to Landsat 8 OLI (SSRL) bands and the CM composition using the best subset regression method and regression analyses. The resulting model was applied to Landsat 8 OLI images to map the surface CM alteration. The results show that CM alteration observed in the O&G field is an indicator of hydrocarbon microseepage at the surface. These results can be used as a technique to identify prospective regions that contain hydrocarbons and differentiate from those that are barren, and could be useful for increasing the rate of drilling success.

TI  - Potential land suitability identification for surface irrigation: in case of Gumara watershed, Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of potential land for surface irrigation is very important to prevent food insecurity in a country. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to identify possible areas suitable for irrigation by analyzing parameters considered to be important in the fulfillment of the study by using the environment of the Geospatial Information System integrated with multi-criteria decision techniques. The researchers selected six important factors to complete the study. These six parameters were listed as proximity, topography, land use, soil texture class, soil depth, and soil drainage classes. The result of the study shows that, of the entire watershed area, 19.98% is highly appropriate, 30.98% is moderately appropriate, 47.18% is marginally appropriate, and 1.91% is not appropriate for the aforementioned purposes. Based on the topography of the watershed, the analysis indicates that 40,234% of the gradient in the Gumara watershed was very appropriate for the application of surface irrigation. On the other hand, based on the spatial analysis of the dynamics of land use/land cover dynamics in the area, the result indicates that 85.47% of the changes in land use/land cover were very appropriate; however, 0.04% of the dynamics of land use was not adequate for the implementation of surface irrigation for Gumara watershed. In general, the final thematic map of the study area shows that among the entire area of the watershed, 252.65 km(2) of the area were very appropriate for the application of surface irrigation. Therefore, the combination of primary data collected from the field and remote sensing data that were analyzed in the geospatial information system environment help the outcome of this study and are recommended to be found throughout southern Gondar, Amhara, Ethiopia. Finally, the cross-tabulation of each parameter considered was calculated to assess the impact of each parameter on the final result.

TI  - The effect of death education on fear of death amongst Italian adolescents: A nonrandomized controlled study
T2  - DEATH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the psychological effects of death education in reducing the fear of death in a large cohort of Italian adolescents. Following the constructs of "distal defenses" and "mortality salience" of Terror Management Theory, this research intervention also evaluated the proposition that spirituality and belief in an afterlife could provide an effective buffer against fear of death. Five hundred thirty-four Italian high school students participated in a school-based death education program with an experimental group and a nonrandomized control condition. Using a pre/post-course design, we assessed fear of death, alexithymia, and representations of death and spirituality for both groups. Results confirmed that the course reduced death fears and the representation of death as annihilation while also enhancing spirituality. In particular, the older participants in the death education course increased their spirituality and decreased their fear of death, whereas females reduced their conviction that death was an absolute annihilation. Finally, the structural model suggested that alexithymia mediates the relationships among fear of death and spirituality; in particular, fear of death predicted more alexithymia and more alexithymia predicted lower spirituality.

TI  - Geodetic investigation of landslides and land subsidence: case study of the Bhurkunda coal mines and the Sirobagarh landslide
T2  - SURVEY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a geodetic deformation monitoring approach and its application on two severely affected and uninvestigated study sites in India, namely the Bhurkunda coal mines in Jharkhand, and the Sirobagarh landslide in Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand. For the Bhurkunda site (characterized by underground coal mining related subsidence), a network of 56 GNSS points, densified by Total Station (TS) ground points, was set up during three field visits. GNSS derived deformation estimates reveal that the southern part of the investigated area underwent subsidence (maximum displacement 1.813 m). Furthermore, DEM differences of the three epochs generated using TS points detect a subsidence of 1.358 +/- 0.057 m with similar pattern and magnitude of movement as detected by GNSS stations. For the Sirobagarh landslide (witnessing recurring slides due to local geological conditions and rainfall), a GNSS network of six control points in an area of 500x600 m(2) was established. Deformation estimates from GNSS show subsidence in the area with a horizontal trend of movement towards the Alaknanda river situated below the landslide (maximum horizontal and vertical displacement values are 0.1306 m and 2.1315 m respectively). Further, for the Sirobagarh landslide, multi-temporal interferometry using Sentinel-1 SAR images detect displacement vectors showing downward movement of the landslide, with displacement rates ranging from 0.008 to -0.115 m yr(-1). It is evident that the landslide scarp encountered high magnitude subsidence, whereas the area containing and surrounding the landslide (30 km(2)) underwent a moderate rate of subsidence. A set of surveying guidelines for monitoring deformation events of similar kind are discussed.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics in East Rennell Island World Heritage Site using multi-sensor and multi-temporal remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - East Rennell of Solomon Island is the first natural site under customary law to be inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. Potential threats due to logging, mining and agriculture led to the site being declared a World Heritage in Danger in 2013. For East Rennell World Heritage Site (ERWHS) to 'shed' its 'Danger' status the management must monitor forest cover both within and outside of ERWHS. We used satellite data from multiple sources to track forest cover changes for the entire East Rennell island since 1998. 95% of the island is still covered by undisturbed forests; annual average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the whole island was above 0.91 in 2015. However, vegetation cover in the island has been slowly decreasing, at a rate of -0.0011 NDVI per year between 2000 and 2015. This decrease less pronounced inside ERWHS compared to areas outside. While potential threats due to forest clearing outside ERWHS remain the forest cover change from 2000 to 2015 has been below 15%. We suggest ways in which the Government of Solomon Islands could use our data as well as unmanned air vehicles and field surveys to monitor forest cover change and ensure the future conservation of ERWHS.

TI  - Multitemporal ensemble learning for snow cover extraction from high-spatial-resolution images in mountain areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial and -temporal resolution snow cover products in mountain areas are important to hydrological applications. The GF-1 satellite provides multispectral images with 8-m resolution and a revisit up to 2 days, which makes it possible to produce snow cover products. However, it is challenging to extract snow cover from these images because of limited spectral bands, severe mountain shadows, and dataset-shift problem in multitemporal classification. To overcome the limitations above, this study proposes a multitemporal ensemble learning framework to extract snow cover from high-spatial-resolution images in mountain areas. The principle behind ensemble learning, i.e. learning from disagreement, is extended from single image classification to multitemporal ones. We assume that multitemporal training samples selected within time-invariant classes at the same locations can be different in feature space. Such disagreements are used in multitemporal ensemble learning to improve classification accuracy. To enhance both accuracy and diversity of the multiple classifiers trained on these samples, a joint feature selection method is suggested to select the optimal multitemporal feature space and a joint parameter optimization method is designed to ensemble classifiers trained for multitemporal images. The experiments show that the performances of multitemporal ensemble classifiers are superior to that of single classifiers, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

T2  - MECHANICS & INDUSTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The modeling and analysis of the assembly contact problems in the picking and placement of the automobile alternator frame are carried out in the multi-station processing. According to the three-dimensional assembly characteristics of the actual alternator frame and the fixture, the assembly model in the drilling and milling station is simplified. The alternator frame and fixture assembly problem as a whole is simplified to a dual peg-in-hole assembly problem. All possible one-point contact states and two-point contact states during the assembly process are proposed(L-1)similar to(R-10). The contact force analysis is carried out on the typical one-contact state L-1 and the typical two-point contact state L-5, and the relationship between the corresponding assembly forces F-x, F-y, F-z and the assembly moments M-x, M-y, M-z is obtained. According to the relationship between these assembly forces and assembly moments, the corresponding jamming diagrams are obtained. Finally, according to the three-dimensional size of the actual alternator frame, the experimental verification was carried out by using a 6-DOF force/moment sensor. The experimental results confirmed the validity of the analysis. Technical support is provided for the assembly of automobile alternator frames based on force sensing control for the follow-up work.

TI  - Mapping Maize Fields by Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A Images in Makarfi, Northern Nigeria, Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A timely and accurate crop type mapping is very significant, and a prerequisite for agricultural regions and ensuring global food security. The combination of remotely sensed optical and radar datasets presents an opportunity for acquiring crop information at relative spatial resolution and temporal resolution adequately to capture the growth profiles of various crop species. In this paper, we employed Sentinel-1A (S-1) and Sentinel-2A (S-2) data acquired between the end of June and early September 2016, on a semi-arid area in northern Nigeria. A different set of (VV and VH) SAR and optical (SI and SB) images, illustrating crop phenological development stage, were employed as inputs to the two machines learning Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to automatically map maize fields. Significant increases in overall classification were shown when the multi-temporal spectral indices (SI) and spectral band (SB) datasets were added with the different integration of SAR datasets (i.e., VV and VH). The best overall accuracy (OA) for maize (96.93%) was derived by using RF classification algorithms with SI-SB-SAR datasets, although the SI datasets for RF and SB datasets for SVM also produced high overall maize classification accuracies, of 97.04% and 97.44%. The outcomes indicate the robustness of the RF or SVM methods to produce high-resolution maps of maize for subsequent application from agronomists, policy planners, and the government, because such information is lacking in our study area.

T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture and associated sectors are one of the primary sources of living for the global population. Sustainability in agriculture will yield long-term benefits requisite to accomplish development and mitigation of resource scarcity. Hence, realistic assessment of water requirement for agricultural use or alternatively agricultural potential from available water resources is imperative to sustainable water management keeping in view of possible scarce situation in relation to freshwater availability across the Globe. The present study focuses on assessment of the water requirement for potential agricultural use for the command area of a Himalayan river project, namely Gandak river project in Northern India using extensive geo-spatial techniques. Detailed information of extensive canal network is derived from high-resolution satellite images using GIS tools, along with other spatially distributed information for relevant parameters such as rainfall, temperature, soil type, elevation, water-holding capacity and agricultural productivity. The study reasonably identifies the spatial variability in water requirement potential in the project command with rational indication of maximum water demand in north-central section of the study area where the lowest aridity index characterized by very low slope and deep sandy loam soil is recorded. Efficient usage with growing scarcity of this essential natural resource warrants efficiency optimization of water usage with realistic assessment. This approach unlike traditional method uses high-resolution satellite data that are more scientific and accurate and will undoubtedly facilitate development of rational decision support system for efficient management of available surface water use for different purposes in the region.

TI  - Quantifying Changes in Plant Species Diversity in a Savanna Ecosystem Through Observed and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the impact of climate change on plant species diversity of a savanna ecosystem, through an assessment of climatic trends over a period of forty years (1974-2014) using Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe, as a case study. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as a proxy for plant species diversity to cover for the absence of long-term historical plant diversity data. Observed precipitation and temperature data collected over the review period were compared with the trends in NDVI to understand the impact of climate change on plant species diversity over time. The nonaligned block sampling design was used as the sampling framework, from which 198 sampling plots were identified. Data sources included satellite images, field measurements, and direct observations. Temperature and precipitation had significant (p < 0.05) trends over the period under study. However, the trend for seasonal total precipitation was not significant but declining. Significant correlations (p < 0.001) were identified between various climate variables and the Shannon index of diversity. NDVI was also significantly correlated to the Shannon index of diversity. The declining trend of plant species in savanna ecosystems is directly linked to the decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures.

TI  - Diagnosing Subsidence Geohazard at Beijing Capital International Airport, from High-Resolution SAR Interferometry
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) has suffered from uneven land subsidence since 1935, which affects the smoothness of airport runways and seriously threatens the safety of aircrafts. In this paper, a spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) with high-resolution Cosmo-SkyMed SAR data was utilized at BCIA for the first time to diagnose the subsidence hazard. The results show that subsidence is progressing at BCIA at a maximum rate of 50 mm/year, which is mainly distributed in the northwest side of the airport. It was found that the Shunyi-Liangxiang fault directly traverses Runway2 and Runway3 and causes uneven subsidence, controlling the spatial subsidence pattern to some degree. Four driving factors of subsidence were investigated, namely: the over-exploitation of groundwater, active faults, compressible soil thickness, and aquifer types. For the future sustainable development of BCIA, the influence of Beijing new airport and Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA), was analyzed and predicted. It is necessary to take relevant measures to control the uneven subsidence during the initial operation of BDIA and conduct long-term monitoring to ensure the regular safe operation of BCIA. This case demonstrates a remote sensing method of diagnosing the subsidence hazard with high accuracy and non-contact, providing a reliable alternative for the geohazard diagnosis of key infrastructures in the future.

TI  - US imperiled species are most vulnerable to habitat loss on private lands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To stem the ongoing loss of biodiversity, conservation practitioners must distinguish between effective and ineffective approaches for protecting species habitats. Using Google Earth Engine and 31 years of Landsat images, we quantified changes in the habitats of 24 vertebrates listed under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) and on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List across categories of land ownership (eg federal, state, private) in the continental US that are subject to different conservation-focused legal restrictions. These estimates exclude changes attributable to agricultural conversion and burned areas. The imperiled species we evaluated lost the least amount of habitat (3.6%) on federal lands, whereas losses on private lands without conservation easements were more than twice as high (8.1%). Differences in annual percent loss before and after ESA listing, and between ESA-listed and Red List species, indicate that the ESA limited habitat loss and was most effective on federal lands. These results underscore the importance of federal lands in protecting habitat for imperiled species and highlight the need to improve habitat protection on private lands for long-term conservation.

TI  - Evidences of neotectonic activity along Goriganga River, Higher Central Kumaun Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the analysis of geomorphic landform development, particularly between the Trans Himadri Fault and the Main Central Thrust including Berinag Thrust and other major NNE-SSW and NW-SE striking faults/thrusts in the Higher Central Kumaun Himalaya. Digital analysis of remote sensing data, field investigations including drainage analysis, and development of landforms have been carried out to understand the morphotectonic evolution and, thereby, the neotectonics in this region. A number of morphometric indices [(stream length-gradient index (SL), steepness index (k(s)), Chi (chi)] were computed together with knick point analysis. Offsetting of the major river and tributaries was observed along a NNW-SSE direction. Other tectonic landforms, including truncated saddles and disturbed terrace patterns, show that the area is presently undergoing active deformation. The valley floor morphology in the vicinity of the major thrusts provides evidence for aggradation of recent fluvial activity. Developments of various neotectonic features, such as starth terraces, off-streams, truncated saddles, disrupted terraces, and palaeolake deposits, are evidences for recent tectonic activities associated with the major thrusts/faults. Cut-and-fill terraces with thick alluvial cover, debris-flow terraces, and alluvial fan terraces are significant aggradational landforms observed within the valley that provide signatures of past climatic records. Our study reveals that the fluvially modified debris-flow terraces were formed between 5 and 20 ka. We infer that the major phase of valley-fill happened between 5 and 12 ka, whereas the youngest phase of aggradation may have responded to the Holocene tectonic activity that took place around 5-6 ka. The study is significant to understand the recent geomorphic development and tectonic deformation in the study area and may be helpful for future infrastructural development in the region.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Characteristics and Driving Forces of Vegetation Changes in the Huaihe River Basin from 2003 to 2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation, and MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST) data were used as data sources in an analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation changes and ecological environmental quality in the Huaihe River basin, China, from 2003 to 2018. The Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test and the Theil-Sen slope test were combined for this analysis; then, when combined with the results of the MK mutation test and two introduced indexes, the kurtosis coefficient (KU) and skewness (SK) and correlations between NDVI, precipitation (TRMM), and land-surface temperature (LST) in different time scales were revealed. The results illustrate that the mean NDVI in the Huaihe River basin was 0.54. The annual NDVImax curve fluctuations for different land cover types were almost the same. The main reasons for the decrease in or disappearance of vegetation cover in the Huaihe River basin were the expansion of towns and impact of human activities. Furthermore, vegetation cover around water areas was obviously degraded and wetland protections need to be strengthened urgently. On the same time scale, change trends of NDVI, TRMM, and LST after abrupt changes became consistent within a short time period. Vegetation growth was favored when the KU and SK of TRMM had a close to normal distribution within one year. Monthly TRMM and LST can better reflect NDVI fluctuations compared with seasonal and annual scales. When the precipitation (TRMM) is less than 767 mm, the average annual NDVI of different land cover types is not ideal. Compared with other land cover types, dry land has stronger adaptability to changes in the LST when the LST is between 19 and 22.6 degrees C. These trends can serve as scientific reference for protecting and managing the ecological environment in the Huaihe River basin.

TI  - Applying FP_ILM to the retrieval of geometry-dependent effective Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GE_LER) daily maps from UVN satellite measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of trace gas, cloud, and aerosol measurements from ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared (UVN) sensors requires precise information on surface properties that are traditionally obtained from Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) climatologies. The main drawbacks of using LER climatologies for new satellite missions are that (a) climatologies are typically based on previous missions with significantly lower spatial resolutions, (b) they usually do not account fully for satellite-viewing geometry dependencies characterized by bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects, and (c) climatologies may differ considerably from the actual surface conditions especially with snow/ice scenarios.In this paper we present a novel algorithm for the retrieval of geometry-dependent effective Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GE_LER) from UVN sensors; the algorithm is based on the full-physics inverse learning machine (FP_ILM) retrieval. Radiances are simulated using a radiative transfer model that takes into account the satellite-viewing geometry, and the inverse problem is solved using machine learning techniques to obtain the GE_LER from satellite measurements.The GE_LER retrieval is optimized not only for trace gas retrievals employing the DOAS algorithm, but also for the large amount of data from existing and future atmospheric Sentinel satellite missions. The GE_LER can either be deployed directly for the computation of air mass factors (AMFs) using the effective scene approximation or it can be used to create a global gapless geometry-dependent LER (G3_LER) daily map from the GE_LER under clear-sky conditions for the computation of AMFs using the independent pixel approximation.The GE_LER algorithm is applied to measurements of TROPOMI launched in October 2017 on board the EU/ESA Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission. The TROPOMI GE_LER/G3_LER results are compared with climatological OMI and GOME-2 LER datasets and the advantages of using GE_LER/G3_LER are demonstrated for the retrieval of total ozone from TROPOMI.

TI  - Malignant melanoma of the breast: controversies in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of a rare nosologic entity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma of the breast is an infrequent entity, presenting as either primary or metastatic from extramammary solid neoplasms. Depending on the involvement of the skin, primary malignant melanoma of the breast (PMMB) can be classified as cutaneous or noncutaneous. Cutaneous PMMB accounts for <5% of all melanomas and only 0.5% of all breast cancers. Furthermore, despite the rarity of metastatic breast neoplasms, melanoma comprises a frequent source of metastases. Metastatic potential of melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, and the majority of patients present more than one metastatic foci at the time of diagnosis. Diagnostic approach for both primary and metastatic melanomas of the breast is substantiated by fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology along with immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless, verification of a metastatic mammary melanoma requires the discovery of a primary lesion. The mainstay of treatment for primary tumors is surgery, with radical local excision and axillary lymph node dissection or, on occasion, axillary sentinel node resection, while for metastatic tumors it depends on the specificities of the melanoma. Adjuvant therapy is always implemented. The aim of this survey is to meticulously review the literature of primary and metastatic malignant melanomas of the breast and report epidemiologic and clinicopathologic data for this rare entity. Clinical features, histogenesis, morphological, and immunochemical findings are discussed, while the role of current diagnostic and therapeutic management of this uncommon entity is emphasized.

TI  - An Analysis of Urban Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Blantyre City, Southern Malawi (1994-2018)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned urban growth has adverse environmental and social consequences. This is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa where the urbanisation rate is high and characterised by the proliferation of informal settlements. It is, therefore, crucial that urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes be investigated in order to enhance effective planning and sustainable growth. In this paper, the spatial and temporal LULC changes in Blantyre city were studied using the integration of remotely sensed Landsat imageries of 1994, 2007 and 2018, and a geographic information system (GIS). The supervised classification method using the support vector machine algorithm was applied to generate the LULC maps. The study also analysed the transition matrices derived from the classified map to identify prominent processes of changes for planning prioritisation. The results showed that the built-up class, which included urban structures such as residential, industrial, commercial and public installations, increased in the 24-year study period. On the contrary, bare land, which included vacant lands, open spaces with little or no vegetation, hilly clear-cut areas and other fallow land, declined over the study period. This was also the case with the vegetation class (i.e., forests, parks, permanent tree-covered areas and shrubs). The post-classification results revealed that the LULC changes during the second period (2007-2018) were faster compared to the first period (1994-2007). Furthermore, the results revealed that the increase in built-up areas systematically targeted the bare land and avoided the vegetated areas, and that the vegetated areas were systematically cleared to bare land during the study period (1994-2018). The findings of this study have revealed the pressure of human activities on the land and natural environment in Blantyre and provided the basis for sustainable urban planning and development in Blantyre city.

TI  - Biomimetic Organisations: A Management Model that Learns from Nature
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the end of the last century, different approaches for corporate management have been appearing that try to incorporate the social advances that are being produced and disseminated thanks to the greater capacity of communication available through social networks and other traditional avenues. Among the best known are Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainability, the Circular Economy, and Collaborative Economics. All of them add value to organisations, and all of them have a common characteristic: they are anthropocentric approaches. Our proposal goes a step further: we need a worldview that is capable of placing organisations in a position of continuous learning looking at nature, because it is the best way to integrate into it as a more ecosystem and thus achieve its flowering respecting the once to all the other subsystems that make up the planet: Organizational Biomimicry. This work compares the anthropocentric vision with the worldview at the same time that it offers a guide of the essential steps so that Organizational Biomimicry is the new model of corporate management.

TI  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in patients with bacteraemia at tertiary hospitals in South Africa, 2015 to 2018
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhanced surveillance for CREs was established at national sentinel sites in South Africa. We aimed to apply an epidemiological and microbiological approach to characterise CREs and to assess trends in antimicrobial resistance from patients admitted to tertiary academic hospitals. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients of all ages with CRE bacteraemia admitted at any one of 12 tertiary academic hospitals in four provinces (Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and Free State) in South Africa. The study period was from July 2015 to December 2018. A case of CRE bacteraemia was defined as a patient admitted to one of the selected tertiary hospitals where any of the Enterobacteriaceae was isolated from a blood culture, and was resistant to the carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem and/or doripenem) or had a positive result for the Modified Hodge Test (MHT) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. A positive blood culture result obtained after 21 days of the last blood culture result was regarded as a new case. To distinguish hospital-acquired (HA) from the community-acquired (CA) bacteraemia, the following definitions were applied: the HA CRE bacteraemia was defined as a patient with CRE isolated from blood culture >= 72 h of hospital admission or with any prior healthcare contact, within 1 year prior to the current episode or referral from a healthcare facility where the patient was admitted before the current hospital. A case of the CA CRE bacteraemia was defined as a patient with CRE isolated from blood culture < 72 h of hospital admission and with no prior healthcare contact. The majority of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) (70%) were hospital-acquired (HA) with Klebsiella pneumoniae being the predominant species (78%). In-hospital mortality rate was 38%. The commonest carbapenemase genes were bla-(OXA-48) (52%) and bla-(NDM) (34%). The high mortality rate related to bacteraemia with CRE and the fact that most were hospital-acquired infections highlights the need to control the spread of these drug-resistant bacteria. Replacement with OXA-48 is the striking finding from this surveillance analysis. Infection control and antibiotic stewardship play important roles in decreasing the spread of resistance.

TI  - Biome-level relationships between vegetation indices and climate variables using time-series analysis of remotely-sensed data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature play a vital role in the growth characteristics of vegetation. While the relationship between climate and vegetation growth can be accurately predicted in instances where vegetation is homogenous, this becomes complex to determine in heterogeneous vegetation environments. The aim of this paper was to study the relationship between remotely-sensed monthly vegetation indices (i.e. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index) and climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) using time-series analysis at the biome-level. Specifically, the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL1 and ARDL2, corresponding respectively to one month and two month lags) and the Koyck-transformed distributed lag model were used to build regression models. All three models estimated NDVI and EVI fairly accurately in all biomes (Relative Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE): 12.0-26.4%). Biomes characterized by relative homogeneity (Grassland, Savanna, Indian Ocean Coastal Belt and Forest Biomes) achieved the most accurate estimates due to the dominance of a few species. Comparisons of lag size (one month compared to two months) generally showed similarities (Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and log-likelihood) with quite high comparability in certain biomes - this indicates the utility of the ARDL1 and ARDL2 model, depending on the availability of appropriate data. These findings demonstrate the variation in estimation linked to the biome, and thus the validity of biome-level correlation of climatic data and vegetation indices.

TI  - Satellite observations of the 2016-2017 eruption of Bogoslof volcano: aviation and ash fallout hazard implications from a water-rich eruption
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data (GOES, VIIRS, MODIS, AVHRR) were used in near real-time during the 2016-2017 eruption of Bogoslof volcano, Alaska, to detect explosive eruptive activity and to characterize the resulting volcanic clouds. This study examines satellite data to estimate volcanic cloud heights and mass eruption rates for 47 of the 70 explosive events. Eighteen of the volcanic clouds reached an altitude in excess of 8.5 km asl, where they posed a potential hazard to aviation. We estimate eruption rates were in the range of 10(4)-10(7) kg/s. Eruption durations were available for 28 events, and the total mass of these events was 5.7 x 10(10) kg. Most of the explosions occurred from submarine vents, producing volcanic clouds with water-rich characteristics in satellite data. We infer that these water-rich (phreatomagmatic) events contained ice-coated ash particles, which changed their visible and multispectral characteristics. Only two of the explosions produced clouds with satellite characteristics that would be considered ash-rich. We conclude that these events were relatively dry eruptions with limited access to ocean water. Although some of the explosive events transitioned from submarine to subaerial vents, we observed no change in the character of the volcanic clouds during these transitions. We speculate that enhanced removal of fine-grained volcanic ash likely occurred due to aggregation, with implications for modeling ash transport and fallout. We conclude that the majority of Bogoslof's water-rich volcanic clouds did contain volcanic ash despite the lack of conventional "ash signature" in satellite data. This has implications for satellite monitoring of future water-rich/shallow submarine eruptions.

TI  - Barriers and Facilitators to De-Implementation of the Choosing Wisely® Guidelines for Low-Value Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. To address overuse of unnecessary practices, several surgical organizations have participated in the Choosing Wisely (R) campaign and identified four breast cancer surgical procedures as unnecessary. Despite evidence demonstrating no survival benefit for all four, evidence suggests only two have been substantially de implemented. Our objective was to understand why surgeons stop performing certain unnecessary cancer operations but not others and how best to de-implement entrenched and emerging unnecessary procedures.Methods. We sampled surgeons who treat breast cancer in a variety of practice types and geographic regions in the United States. Using a semi-structured guide, we conducted telephone interviews (n = 18) to elicit attitudes and understand practices relating to the four identified breast cancer procedures in the Choosing Wisely (R) campaign. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and anonymized. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis.Results. For the two procedures successfully de-implemented, surgeons described a high level of confidence in the data supporting the recommendations. In contrast, surgeons frequently described a lack of familiarity or skepticism toward the recommendation to avoid sentinel-node biopsy in women >= 70 years of age and the influence of other collaborating oncology providers as justification for continued use. Regarding contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, surgeons consistently agreed with the recommendation that this was unnecessary, yet reported continued utilization due to the value placed on patient autonomy and preference.Conclusions. With a growing focus on the elimination of ineffective, unproven or low value practices, it is imperative that the behavioral determinants are understood and targeted with specific interventions to decrease utilization rapidly.

TI  - Progress in the Remote Sensing Monitoring of the Ecological Environment in Mining Areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Based on the results of an extensive literature research, we summarize the research progress of remote sensing monitoring in terms of identifying mining area boundaries and monitoring land use or land cover changes of mining areas. We also analyze the application of remote sensing in monitoring the biodiversity, landscape structure, vegetation change, soil environment, surface runoff conditions, and the atmospheric environment in mining areas and predict the prospects of remote sensing in monitoring the ecological environment in mining areas. Based on the results, the accurate classification of land use or land cover and the accurate extraction of environmental factors are the basis for remote sensing monitoring of the ecological environment in mining areas. In terms of the extraction of ecological factors, vegetation extraction is relatively advanced in contrast to the extraction of animal and microbial data. For the monitoring of environmental conditions of mining areas, sophisticated methods are available to identify pollution levels of vegetation and to accurately monitor soil quality. However, the methods for water and air pollution monitoring in mining areas still need to be improved. These limitations considerably impede the application of remote sensing monitoring in mining areas. The solving of these problems depends on the progress of multi-source remote sensing data and stereoscopic monitoring techniques.

TI  - Recognition of Landscape Key Areas in a Coal Mine Area of a Semi-Arid Steppe in China: A Case Study of Yimin Open-Pit Coal Mine
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological integrity and biodiversity of steppes were destroyed under the long-term and high-intensity development of open-pit coal mines in China, causing desertification, steppe degradation, landscape function defect, and so on. As a source of species maintenance and dispersal, an ecological source is a key area for preservation in order to restore the ecological security pattern of the larger landscape. The purpose of this study was to establish a landscape key area recognition model to identify the landscape key areas (LKA) surrounding an open pit coalmine located in semi-arid steppe. This study takes the Yimin open pit mining area as a case study. We assessed Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing images taken during the peak season of vegetation growth from July to August in 1999, 2006, 2011, and 2017. From these images, we identified the main landscape types and vegetation coverage grades in order to identify the ecological land. Next, we applied the three indices of Importance of Patch Connectivity, Habitat Quality, and Ecosystem Service Value to calculate the comprehensive results that identify ecological land. Finally, the ecological land quality results of different years are superimposed and averaged, and then Very Important Patch (VIMP), Important Patch (IMP), and General Patch (GEP) areas were used for LKA extraction. Our results showed LKA to cover 177.35 km(2), accounting for 20.01% of the total study area. The landscape types identified as LKA are primarily grassland (47.37%), wetland (40.27%), and shrubland (11.88%), indicating that landscape type correlates strongly with its value as a landscape key area. The proposed landscape key area recognition model could enrich the foundations for ecological planning and ecological security pattern construction in order to support ecological protection and restoration in semi-arid steppe areas affected by coal mining.

TI  - Utility of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Fusion Imaging for Prediction of Metastasis to Sentinel and Nonsentinel Nodes in Patients with Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography fusion imaging (F-18-FDG PET/CT) is an important diagnostic tool in breast cancer. The utility of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of primary tumors has been evaluated to predict sentinel node (SN) and non-SN metastasis in clinically node-negative (cNO) patients.Patients and Methods. F-18-FDG PET/CT was performed on 414 cNO patients. The following parameters were evaluated: SUVmax at 60 min (SUVmax1), SUVmax at 120 min (SUVmax2), percent change between SUVmax 1 and SUVmax2 (Delta SUVmax%), SN metastasis foci maximum size (SN meta size), and ratio of metastatic SNs to total SNs or SN ratio (SNR). It was assessed whether these were risk factors for SN metastasis. The relationship between these parameters and the status of SN and/or non-SN metastasis was retrospectively explored to predict non-SN metastasis.Results. All SUV parameters significantly correlated with pathological T factor (pT), nuclear grade, lymphatic invasion (Ly), and Ki-67 labeling index. On multivariate analysis, pT and Ly were independent predictive factors for SN metastasis. In SN meta-positive cases, SN meta size, SNR, and Delta SUVmax% were predictors for non-SN metastasis on univariate analyses, and the former two were independent predictors on multivariate analysis. The combination of SUVmax2 and Delta SUVmax% was an independent predictor of non-SN metastasis (P = 0.0312) and was associated with prediction of non-SN metastasis negative status with high probability (92.3%).Conclusions. In patients with cNO breast cancer, SUV parameters of the primary tumor were correlated with pathological features. The combination of SUVmax2 and Delta SUVmax% may be useful for predicting non-SN metastasis.

TI  - Molecular characterization of circulating respiratory syncytial virus genotypes in Pakistani children, 2010-2013
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Data on the viral etiology of acute lower respiratory infections are scarce in Pakistan. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of morbidity in children but no effective vaccine or antiviral therapy is currently available. As vaccines are expected to become available in the future, it is important to understand the epidemiology of locally prevalent RSV subtypes. This study aimed to define the molecular epidemiology of RSV (A and B) genotypes in Pakistani children under 5 years.Methods: World Health Organization case definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were used for case selection. Children under 5 years who presented with ILI or SARI at tertiary care hospitals from all provinces/regions, including the eight influenza sentinel sites, during October-April each year between 2010 and 2013 were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data of the children were recorded and nasopharyngeal/throat swabs taken for analysis. All samples were tested for RSV A and B using real-time polymerase chain reaction for non-influenza respiratory viruses. Specific oligonucleotide primers for RSV A and B were used for subtyping and sequencing of the G protein, followed by phylogenetic analysis.Results: A total of 1941 samples were included. RSV was detected in 472 (24%) children, with RSV A detected in 367 (78%) and RSV B in 105 (22%). The G protein of all RSV A strains clustered in the NA1/GA2 genotype while RSV B strains carried the signature 60 nucleotide duplication and were assigned to three BA genotypes: BA-9, BA-10 and the new BA-13 genotype.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of RSV as a viral etiologic agent of acute respiratory infections in children in Pakistan, and the diversity of RSV viruses. Continued molecular surveillance for early detection of prevalent and newly emerging genotypes is needed to understand the epidemiology of RSV infections in Pakistan. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - To the Point: Integrating Patient Safety Education Into the Obstetrics and Gynecology Undergraduate Curriculum
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - This article is part of the To the Point Series prepared by the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics Undergraduate Medical Education Committee. Principles and education in patient safety have been well integrated into academic obstetrics and gynecology practices, although progress in safety profiles has been frustratingly slow. Medical students have not been included in the majority of these ambulatory practice or hospital-based initiatives. Both the Association of American Medical Colleges and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education have recommended incorporating students into safe practices. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education milestone 1 for entering interns includes competencies in patient safety. We present data and initiatives in patient safety, which have been successfully used in undergraduate and graduate medical education. In addition, this article demonstrates how using student feedback to assess sentinel events can enhance safe practice and quality improvement programs. Resources and implementation tools will be discussed to provide a template for incorporation into educational programs and institutions. Medical student involvement in the culture of safety is necessary for the delivery of both high-quality education and high-quality patient care. It is essential to incorporate students into the ongoing development of patient safety curricula in obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  - Evaluating tools to define influenza baseline and threshold values using surveillance data, Egypt, season 2016/17
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Establishing influenza thresholds and transmission intensity can help evaluate seasonal changes in influenza severity and potential pandemics. We aimed to evaluate the moving epidemic method (MEM) for calculating influenza thresholds for season 2016/17 in Egypt using four parameters, to identify the most useful parameter. Also to measure the agreement between both the country-specific statistical empirical method and World Health Organization method to MEM for determining the length and intensity level of activity of the influenza season.Methods: Routinely epidemiological and laboratory data from sentinel surveillance sites for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were used for calculating thresholds for seasons between 2010/11 and 2015/16 to test 2016/17 season. The parameters calculated were: screened ILI consultation rate x 1000, screened ILI composite parameter, influenza positivity percentage among sampled SARI cases, and influenza positivity percentage among sampled ILI and SARI cases. These parameters assess seasonality and intensity of influenza activity using the three proposed methods (mentioned above). Agreement between the three methods was done using several approaches.Results: The intensity of influenza activity by MEM was lower than the other two methods. Agreement between MEM and each of the other two techniques varied appreciably from good to very good for seasonal duration, and poor to fair for intensity level. In addition, parameters including laboratory data showed a pattern of bi-wave activity; the first wave occurred in winter mostly between epidemiological weeks 39 and 52 and the second occurred in spring mostly between weeks 12 and 17.Conclusion: Parameters including laboratory data were more useful in defining seasonality of influenza. Further exploration of the MEM model in future seasons may help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its use and application. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) in clinically axillary node negative breast cancer patients - Randomised controlled trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is an important procedure for control of axillary nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients. Lymphedema, restriction of shoulder movement and axillary nodal recurrence are the most disabling complications of the procedure. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) procedure for arm lymph node identification emerged as a step for their preservation during ALND. Here we are testing the effect of ARM on lymphedema development and whether it compromises oncological safety in early breast cancer patients.Patients and methods: 98 clinically node free breast cancer female patients undergoing completion ALND after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy were recruited in the study. They were put into group A (49 patients with ARM + ve preservation ALND) and group B (49 patients in the conventional ALND group). ARM procedure was performed in both groups, ARM positive nodes were preserved in group A, marked and taken out with other axillary LN in group B. The outcome was histopathology of ARM + ve LN, development of arm lymphedema, and restriction of shoulder movement on follow-up.Results: ARM was positive in 46 patients (93.8%) in group A and 43 patients (87.8%) in group B, ARM + ve LN revealed positive metastasis only in 1 patient (2.3%) in group B. Lymphedema developed in 3 (6.5% patients in group A and 9 patients (20.9%) in group B. Restriction of shoulder movement showed a non-significant difference between the two groups.Conclusion: Axillary reverse mapping and preservation of arm lymphatics helped to decrease the lymphedema rate without compromising oncological safety in early breast cancer.

TI  - Allometric scaling of thermal infrared emitted from UK cities and its relation to urban form
T2  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of differences in heat absorption and release between urban and rural landscapes, cities develop a climate different from their surroundings. The rise in global average surface temperature and high rates of urbanization, make it important to understand the energy balance of cities, including whether any energy-balance-related patterns emerge as a function of city size. In this study, images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument, covering the period between 2000 and 2017, were sampled to examine the seasonal (winter and summer) night-time clear-sky upwelling long-wave energy for 35 UK cities. Total (area-summed) emitted energy per overpass per city is shown to correlate closely (R-2 >= 0.79) with population on a log-log 'allometry' plot. The production of emitted energy from the larger cities is smaller than would be produced from a constellation of smaller cities housing the same population. The mean allometry slope over all overpasses sampled is 0.84 +/- 0.06, implying an 'economy (or parsimony) of scale' (i.e., a less-than-proportional increase) of about 21%(i.e. 100(2-10(0.84log(2)))) for each doubling of city population. City area shows a very similar economy of scale, so that the scaling of night-time emitted energy with urban area is close to linear (1.0 +/- 0.05). This linearity with area indicates that the urban forms used in UK cities to accommodate people more efficiently per unit area as the urban population grows, do not have a large effect on the thermal output per unit area in each city. Although often appearing superficially very different, UK cities appear to be similar in terms of the components of urban form that dictate thermal properties. The difference between the scaling of the heat source and literature reports of the scaling of urban-rural air (or surface) temperature difference is very marked, suggesting that the other factors affecting the temperature difference act to decrease strongly its scaling with population.

TI  - Pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP) framework: Progress challenges in improving influenza preparedness response capacities in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2014-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza viruses with pandemic potential have been detected in humans in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework aims to improve the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and increase access of developing countries to vaccines and other life-saving products during a pandemic. Under the Framework, countries have been supported to enhance their capacities to detect, prepare for and respond to pandemic influenza. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, seven countries are priority countries for Laboratory and Surveillance (L&S) support: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Yemen. During 2014-2017, US$ 2.7 million was invested in regional capacity-building and US$ 4.6 million directly in the priority countries. Countries were supported to strengthen influenza diagnostic capacities to improve detection, enhance influenza surveillance systems including sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, and increase global sharing of surveillance data and influenza viruses. This paper highlights the progress made in improving influenza preparedness and response capacities in the Region from 2014 to 2017, and the challenges faced. By 2017, 18 of the 22 countries of the Region had laboratory-testing capacity, 19 had functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems and 22 had trained national rapid response teams. The number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the WHO external quality assurance panel increased from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017, and the number sharing influenza viruses with WHO collaborating centres increased by 75% (from eight to 14 countries); more than half now share influenza data with regional or global surveillance platforms. Seven countries have estimated influenza disease burden and seven have introduced influenza vaccination for high-risk groups. Challenges included: protracted complex emergencies faced by nine countries which hindered implementation of influenza surveillance in areas with the most needs, high staff turnover, achieving timely virus sharing and limited utilization of influenza data where they are available to inform vaccine policies or establish threshold values to measure the start and severity of influenza seasons.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Owing to its ability to rapidly evolve and spread, the influenza virus is of global public health importance. Information on the burden, seasonality and risk factors of influenza in countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region is emerging because of collaborative efforts between countries, WHO and its partners over the past 10 years. The fourth meeting of the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance network was held in Amman, Jordan on 11-14 December 2017. The meeting reviewed the progress and achievements reported by the countries in the areas of surveillance of and response to seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic influenza. The first scientific conference on acute respiratory infection in the Eastern Mediterranean Region was held at the same time and 38 abstracts from young researchers across the Region were presented on epidemiological and virological surveillance, outbreak detection and response, influenza at the animal-human interface, use and efficacy of new vaccines to control respiratory diseases and pandemic influenza threats. The meeting identified a number of challenges and ways to improve the quality of the surveillance system for influenza, sustain the system so as to address pandemic threats and use the data generated from the surveillance system to inform decision-making, policies and practices to reduce the burden of influenza-associated illnesses in the Region.

TI  - Effect of dust loadings, meteorological conditions, and local emissions on aerosol mixing and loading variability over highly urbanized semiarid countries: United Arab Emirates case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term natural and anthropogenic aerosol characteristics over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are investigated in this study. Aerosol characteristics were analyzed using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), local meteorological stations, and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based station during 2006-2015. AOD values significantly increase during the spring and summer seasons and are associated with dust loading during major dust events. The mean annual variation of aerosol loading indicates about a 4.32 and a 11.36% change in the AOD and Angstrom Exponent (AE), respectively, during the study period. Monthly trends show larger AOD and AE variability, 5.4 and 37.8% respectively, with higher aerosol concentrations during the summer. In general, from November to March an upward trend in aerosol characteristics is observed from 2011 to 2015 compared to 2006-2010. In contrast, a neutral to weak decrease in AOD measurements are observed during April-September. Overall, this trend variability is sustained by natural aerosol emissions throughout the year. Meanwhile, a significant increase in AE was measured from May to August of 2011-2015 compared to 2006-2010. This is an indication of an increment of anthropogenic emissions from 2011 to 2015. A correlation between several meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction) and MODIS measurements was performed to investigate the effect of local meteorological conditions on AOD from 2006 to 2015 over the UAE. Some statistical correlation was observed between AOD, wind speed, and air temperature. A weak correlation was observed between temperature, relative humidity, and AOD, while a strong correlation was observed between wind speed and AOD. Dry soil formed due to a lack of rainfall, along with high summer temperatures and high-speed winds which stimulate dust aerosol loading and lifetime in the atmosphere. Aerosol characteristics, including dominant aerosols, were identified over the UAE using the Mezaria AERONET station. Air mass flow towards the UAE from the North West (NW) and West (W) directions moves over highly polluted regions and desert areas. Coarse-mode aerosol particles dominate over the UAE during March-June associated with the dust season, while a high loading of fine-mode particles is mostly observed during September-January.

TI  - Evaluation of Deep Learning Techniques for Deforestation Detection in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado Biomes From Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is one of the major threats to natural ecosystems. This process has a substantial contribution to climate change and biodiversity reduction. Therefore, the monitoring and early detection of deforestation is an essential process for preservation. Techniques based on satellite images are among the most attractive options for this application. However, many approaches involve some human intervention or are dependent on a manually selected threshold to identify regions that suffer deforestation. Motivated by this scenario, the present work evaluates Deep Learning-based strategies for automatic deforestation detection, namely, Early Fusion (EF), Siamese Network (SN), and Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM), used as the baseline. The target areas are two regions with different deforestation patterns: the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Brazil. The experiments used two co-registered Landsat 8 images acquired at different dates. The strategies based on Deep Learning achieved the best performance in our analysis in comparison with the baseline, with SN and EF superior to CSVM and SVM. In the same way, a reduction of the salt-and-pepper effect in the generated probabilistic change maps was noticed as the number of training samples increased. Finally, the work assesses how the methods can reduce the time invested in the visual inspection of deforested areas.

TI  - Refusal bias in HIV data from the Demographic and Health Surveys: Evaluation, critique and recommendations
T2  - STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-response is a commonly encountered problem in many population-based surveys. Broadly speaking, non-response can be due to refusal or failure to contact the sample units. Although both types of non-response may lead to bias, there is much evidence to indicate that it is much easier to reduce the proportion of non-contacts than to do the same with refusals. In this article, we use data collected from a nationally representative survey under the Demographic and Health Surveys program to study non-response due to refusals to HIV testing in Malawi. We review existing estimation methods and propose novel approaches to the estimation of HIV prevalence that adjust for refusal behaviour. We then explain the data requirement and practical implications of the conventional and proposed approaches. Finally, we provide some general recommendations for handling non-response due to refusals and we highlight the challenges in working with Demographic and Health Surveys and explore different approaches to statistical estimation in the presence of refusals. Our results show that variation in the estimated HIV prevalence across different estimators is due largely to those who already know their HIV test results. In the case of Malawi, variations in the prevalence estimates due to refusals for women are larger than those for men.

TI  - "It's terrible and I'm not going to try to tell you it isn't": Steinbeck's Perspectives on Education
T2  - STEINBECK REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - John Steinbeck's formal schooling experiences shaped his worldview of education as a series of dreary classrooms in which children studied "Subjects in which no one was interested." Yet he had great reverence for teachers and envisioned teaching to be an art form with potential to awaken the mind and spirit with curiosity, while also providing literacy opportunities for the children of migrants and the poor. From this perspective, his vision aligns with that of John Dewey, Jane Addams, and other progressive reformers. Steinbeck's hatred of formal schooling, combined with his progressive belief about the power of learning, reading; and inquiry, shaped both his fictional portrayals of schooling and also his persuasive essays on related subjects. This analysis of Steinbeck's attitudes toward education has a triple focus: his own experiences as a student; the state of the contemporary educational curriculum, policies, and practices; and the experiences of his fictional characters as they encounter formal and informal educational opportunities. The study reveals connections between Steinbeck's work and a surprising range of educational issues-from compulsory attendance to the contrast between rural and urban attitudes to classism in higher education. Although Steinbeck did not propose an educational or curriculum design, in his own life he modeled the value of participation in the act of learning-chielly by seeking out excellent mentors and reading broadly Thus, the examples set by his own hie and in his fiction continue to challenge an educational system focused on conformity, often to the neglect or exclusion of creativity.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of the CARTOSAT DEM using robust statistical measures
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - CARTOSAT-1-derived 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model (DEM) for entire India was compiled for several applications. Overall assessment of the accuracy of this product requires additional regional studies involving ground truth control points and accuracy verification methods with a higher level of precision, such as the global positioning system (GPS).The study presented in this paper compares the accuracy of CARTOSAT-1 datasets with respect to eight sites over different terrains in India with the same GPS system. Robust statistical analysis including mean errors, standard deviation error, root mean square error (RMSE), skewness, kurtosis measures and Shapiro-Wilk's normality test were used for evaluating error. The results of this study show a linear trend between the DEM and the ground control points (GCP). The mean error is very high in highlands ranging up to - 14.06 m, whereas in moderate terrain it ranges around 2.65 m and in the lowland about 1.20 m. RMSE ranges up to 28.82 m in rugged high-altitude topographies, 6.24 m in moderate and 1.98 m in low-altitude regions. However, this study shows that CARTODEM is one of the finest DEM that can be used for the Indian subcontinent as it works more accurately over plain and moderately undulating lands.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing and GIS for Groundwater Recharge Potential Zone Mapping in Upper Betwa Watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is unevenly distributed and limited in hard rock terrains. The study has been carried out using remote sensing and GIS to delineate the potential recharge zones of groundwater in upper Betwa watershed, Raisen district, Madhya Pradesh, India. The different thematic layers viz; geology, lineament density, soil, slope, land use/land cover (LU/LC) and drainage density were prepared for assessment of groundwater recharge potential in the area. District Resource Map (DRM) of Geological Survey of India (GSI) 2002 has been used for geological study. SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to obtain the slope. LANDSAT-8 OLI data has been processed for lineament density and LU/LC analysis. Survey of India toposheets were used for drainage density analyses and National Bureau of Soil Survey & Land Use Planning Nagpur (NBSS&LUP) map used for soil study. Weightage has been given to parameters in thematic maps as per the relative influence of each parameter in the groundwater recharge. Rating to each class of parameters was given as per there relative significance in groundwater recharge. Finally, groundwater recharge potential map has been prepared by overlaying all thematic maps in terms of the weighted index overlay (WIO) method. The output map has been further classified into three zones (i) low ground-water potential zone (121.80 km(2)) (ii) moderate groundwater potential zone (387.78 km(2)) and (iii) high groundwater potential zone (173.35 km(2)). The output results were validated by plotting the specific yield data and groundwater level of selected wells in delineated groundwater recharge potential zones using GPS locations. It has been seen that most of the groundwater productive wells functioning in the area is falling in high and moderate groundwater recharge potential zone.

TI  - Surface Water Evolution (2001-2017) at the Cambodia/Vietnam Border in the Upper Mekong Delta Using Satellite MODIS Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is critical, especially in highly populated areas and in regions under climate change pressure. There is an increasing number of satellite Earth observations that can provide information to monitor surface water at global scale. However, mapping surface waters at local and regional scales is still a challenge for numerous reasons (insufficient spatial resolution, vegetation or cloud opacity, limited time-frequency or time-record, information content of the instrument, lack in global retrieval method, interpretability of results, etc.). In this paper, we use 17 years of the MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) observations at a 8-day resolution. This satellite dataset is combined with ground expertise to analyse the evolution of surface waters at the Cambodia/Vietnam border in the Upper Mekong Delta. The trends and evolution of surface waters are very significant and contrasted, illustrating the impact of agriculture practices and dykes construction. In most of the study area in Cambodia. surface water areas show a decreasing trend but with a strong inter-annual variability. In specific areas, an increase of the wet surfaces is even observed. Ground expertise and historical knowledge of the development of the territory enable to link the decrease to ongoing excavation of drainage canals and the increase of deforestation and land reclamation, exposing flooded surfaces previously hidden by vegetation cover. By contrast, in Vietnam, the decreasing trend in wet surfaces is very clear and can be explained by the development of dykes dating back to the 1990s with an acceleration in the late 2000s as part of a national strategy of agriculture intensification. This study shows that coupling satellite data with ground-expertise allows to monitor surface waters at mesoscale (<100 x 100 km(2)), demonstrating the potential of interdisciplinary approaches for water ressource management and planning.

TI  - Global Site Selection for Astronomy
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A global site selection for astronomy was performed with 1 km spatial resolution (similar to 1 gigapixel in size) using long-term and up-to-date datasets to classify the entire terrestrial surface of the Earth. Satellite instruments are used to get the following datasets of geographical information system (GIS) layers: cloud coverage, digital elevation model, artificial light, precipitable water vapour, aerosol optical depth, wind speed, and land use and land cover. A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique is applied to these datasets, creating four different series where each layer will have a specific weight. We introduce for the first time a suitability index for astronomical sites (SIAS). This index can be used to find suitable locations and to compare different sites or observatories. The midwestern Andes in South America and the Tibetan Plateau in western China were found to be the best in all SIAS series. Considering all the series, less than 3 per cent of all terrestrial surfaces are found to be the best regions to establish an astronomical observatory. In addition to this, only approximately 10 per cent of all current observatories are located in good locations in all SIAS series. Amateurs, institutions or countries aiming to construct an observatory could create a shortlist of potential site locations using a layout of SIAS values for each country without spending time and budget. The outcomes and datasets of this study have been made available through a website, the Astro GIS Database, at www.astrogis.org.

TI  - Is <i>Caretta Caretta</i> a Carrier of Antibiotic Resistance in the Mediterranean Sea?
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea turtles can be considered a sentinel species for monitoring the health of marine ecosystems, acting, at the same time, as a carrier of microorganisms. Indeed, sea turtles can acquire the microbiota from their reproductive sites and feeding, contributing to the diffusion of antibiotic-resistant strains to uncontaminated environments. This study aims to unveil the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in (i) loggerhead sea turtles stranded along the coast of Sicily (Mediterranean Sea), (ii) unhatched and/or hatched eggs, (iii) sand from the turtles' nest and (iv) seawater. Forty-four bacterial strains were isolated and identified by conventional biochemical tests and 16S rDNA sequencing. The Gram-negative Aeromonas and Vibrio species were mainly found in sea turtles and seawater samples, respectively. Conversely, the Gram-positive Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus strains were mostly isolated from eggs and sand. The antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolates revealed that these strains were resistant to cefazolin (95.5%), streptomycin (43.2%), colistin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (34.1%). Moreover, metagenome analysis unveiled the presence of both antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes, as well as the mobile element class 1 integron at an alarming percentage rate. Our results suggest that Caretta caretta could be considered a carrier of antibiotic-resistant genes.

TI  - Evaluation of Remotely Sensed and Interpolated Environmental Datasets for Vector-Borne Disease Monitoring Using In Situ Observations over the Amhara Region, Ethiopia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the sparse distribution of meteorological stations and issues with missing data, vector-borne disease studies in Ethiopia have been commonly conducted based on the relationships between these diseases and ground-based in situ measurements of climate variation. High temporal and spatial resolution satellite-based remote-sensing data is a potential alternative to address this problem. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of daily gridded temperature and rainfall datasets obtained from satellite remote sensing or spatial interpolation of ground-based observations in relation to data from 22 meteorological stations in Amhara Region, Ethiopia, for 2003-2016. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS-Net) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) interpolated temperature showed the lowest bias (mean error (ME) approximate to 1-3 degrees C), and error (mean absolute error (MAE) approximate to 1-3 degrees C), and the highest correlation with day-to-day variability of station temperature (COR approximate to 0.7-0.8). In contrast, temperature retrievals from the blended Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on Earth Observing Satellite (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) passive microwave and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-surface temperature data had higher bias and error. Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall showed the least bias and error (ME approximate to -0.2-0.2 mm, MAE approximate to 0.5-2 mm), and the best agreement (COR approximate to 0.8), with station rainfall data. In contrast FLDAS had the higher bias and error and the lowest agreement and Global Precipitation Mission/Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (GPM/TRMM) data were intermediate. This information can inform the selection of geospatial data products for use in climate and disease research and applications.

TI  - Mapping Three Decades of Changes in the Brazilian Savanna Native Vegetation Using Landsat Data Processed in the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread in the subtropics and tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, savannas are highly heterogeneous and seasonal natural vegetation types, which makes change detection (natural vs. anthropogenic) a challenging task. The Brazilian Cerrado represents the largest savanna in South America, and the most threatened biome in Brazil owing to agricultural expansion. To assess the native Cerrado vegetation (NV) areas most susceptible to natural and anthropogenic change over time, we classified 33 years (1985-2017) of Landsat imagery available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The classification strategy used combined empirical and statistical decision trees to generate reference maps for machine learning classification and a novel annual dataset of the predominant Cerrado NV types (forest, savanna, and grassland). We obtained annual NV maps with an average overall accuracy ranging from 87% (at level 1 NV classification) to 71% over the time series, distinguishing the three main NV types. This time series was then used to generate probability maps for each NV class. The native vegetation in the Cerrado biome declined at an average rate of 0.5% per year (748,687 ha yr(-1)), mostly affecting forests and savannas. From 1985 to 2017, 24.7 million hectares of NV were lost, and now only 55% of the NV original distribution remains. Of the remnant NV in 2017 (112.6 million hectares), 65% has been stable over the years, while 12% changed among NV types, and 23% was converted to other land uses but is now in some level of secondary NV. Our results were fundamental in indicating areas with higher rates of change in a long time series in the Brazilian Cerrado and to highlight the challenges of mapping distinct NV types in a highly seasonal and heterogeneous savanna biome.

TI  - Using satellite imagery to assess impacts of soil and water conservation measures: Evidence from Ethiopia's Tana-Beles watershed
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper combines data on the timing and intensity of soil and water conservation interventions in select Ethiopian watersheds from 2009 to 2016 with a pixel-level panel of vegetative cover and soil moisture derived from satellite imagery to assess the biophysical impacts of such measures using a difference-in-differences specification. The results suggest significant effects overall that vary by season, and that tree planting and other soil and water conservation activities are more effective on degraded than cultivated land. The results are consistent with before-after regressions for daily sediment load and stream flows in a subset of micro-watersheds.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Trends of Aerosols over Urban Regions in Pakistan and Their Possible Links to Meteorological Parameters
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has become one of the most crucial parameters for climate change assessment on regional and global scales. The present study investigates trends in AOD using long-term data derived from moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) over twelve regions in Pakistan. Different statistical tests are used to assess the annual and seasonal trends in AOD. Results reveal increasing AOD trends over most of the selected regions with an obvious increase over the north and northeastern parts of the study area. Annually, increasing trends (0.0002-0.0047 year(-1)) were observed over seven regions, with three being statistically significant. All the selected regions experience increasing AOD trends during the winter season with six being statistically significant while during the summer season seven regions experience increasing AOD trends and the remaining five exhibit the converse with two being statistically significant. The changes in the sign and magnitude of AOD trends have been attributed to prevailing meteorological conditions. The decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature trends mostly support the increasing AOD trend over the selected regions. The high/low AOD phases during the study period may be ascribed to the anomalies in mid-tropospheric relative humidity and wind fields. The summer season is generally characterized by high AOD with peak values observed over the regions located in central plains, which can be attributed to the dense population and enhanced concentration of industrial and vehicular emissions over this part of the study area. The results derived from the present study give an insight into aerosol trends and could form the basis for aerosol-induced climate change assessment over the study area.

TI  - Screening of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections in a Group of Sex Workers in Indoor Settings in the Porto Metropolitan Area
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Early diagnosis is a crucial tool for containing the human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections, particularly in key populations such as sex workers. Despite its relevance, there is a gap considering epidemiological studies and interventions aimed at the monitoring and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections in Portugal. The objectives of this study are: (i) to contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections; and (ii) to evaluate the transfer of screening methods from clinical settings to the outreach context in hidden populations such as sex workers.Material and Methods: The screening of sexually transmitted infections (human immunodeficiency virus 1/2, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea) were carried out in a sample of 100 sex workers during the Porto G outreach intervention in the Metropolitan area of Porto, from September 2015 to September 2016.Results: Six reactive cases for human immunodeficiency virus were identified, five of syphilis, eight of chlamydia and two of gonorrhea. No positive results were detected for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The results were discussed considering the risk gradient and sexually transmitted infections vulnerability in the different sex workers' subgroups.Discussion: The results of this study corroborate the need to promote comprehensive responses to populations most affected by the human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections, such as sex workers. Also, in this group, men who have sex with men and trans women have a higher prevalence than cis women. Intervention strategies should be informed by rigorous epidemiological studies.Conclusion: The adaptation of the screening methodology performed in a clinical setting to the proximity context has shown to be an innovative response in Portugal, especially in sentinel populations.

TI  - An Ocean Color Algorithm Based on Power Functions to Retrieve Inherent Optical Properties From Remotely Sensed Data Off the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean color is determined by the different components of seawater. Satellite ocean color data are commonly used to infer the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of seawater and concentration of chlorophyll $a$ (Chl- $a$ ). Many of the algorithms that relate satellite data to the components of seawater use global data to determine their parameters. Regionalizing the algorithms is recommended to improve the retrieval of IOPs from satellite data. In this article, we use the in situ and satellite data from the southern part of the California Current System (CCS) off the Baja California Peninsula during 1999 to test the Garver and Siegel IOPs' inversion model (GSM). The strong seasonal variability observed in the data was not reproduced by this algorithm. Thus, we propose a new regional algorithm whose order and coefficient depend on seasonal variability. This algorithm includes the linear form of the GSM model but allows changes in two parameters according to the season. These two parameters are the magnitude and spectral shape of the relationship of the remote sensing reflectance with the ratio of the backscattering coefficient and the sum of backscattering and absorption coefficients. In this area, both parameters increase gradually from January to October. The new algorithm improves the retrieval of the IOPs' ratio from an ${r}<^>{2}$ below 0.5 with the GSM model to an ${r}<^>{2}$ that ranges from 0.87 in April and October to 0.93 and 0.94 in January and August, respectively. Furthermore, Chl- $a$ data were used as a proxy to evaluate the new algorithm. Absorption data retrieved from remotely sensed data for 1999, 2008, and 2011 relate well to the in situ Chl- $a$ data.

CP  - Inaugural International Symposium on Water Modelling (iSymWater)
CL  - Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The Volta River in West Africa is one of the most regulated rivers influenced by dams in the world, and the regulation has resulted in substantial impacts on the hydrological alteration and morphological evolution of the Volta River Delta. However, comprehensive analyses of the relevant effects are still lacking to date. In this study, inter-annual variations of river discharge and sediment load for pre- and post-Akosombo Dam periods (1936 to 2018) were analyzed through simple regression and Mann-Kendall (MK) trend analysis whereas the intra-annual variations were dictated by the non-uniformity and regulated coefficients. The shoreline changes were further evaluated using Landsat remote sensing images (1972 to 2018) to explore the effects of hydrological alteration on the morphological evolution of the Volta River Delta. Hydrological analyses show that the inter- and intra-annual variations are much higher in the pre-dam period, suggesting the substantial regulation of the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River. The dam regulation has more significant effects on the sediment load delivered to the delta than the river discharge, which decreased by 92.32% and 23.23%, respectively. Morphological analyses show that the progradation-erosion of the Volta River Delta constantly fluctuates within a relatively small range (maximum 0.5%) after the 1970s. The relationship between the variations of the delta area and sediment load implicates that a quasi-equilibrium state may have been established at the Volta River Delta, given the current sediment load. Our findings provide references for the future regulation and restoration of the Volta River Delta.

TI  - Migration, Remittances, and Forest Cover Change in Rural Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates how migration and remittances affect forest cover in eight rural communities in Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico. Based on household surveys and remote sensing data, we found little evidence to support the widespread claim that migration takes pressure off forests. In the Chiapas sites, we observed no significant changes in forest cover since 1990, while in the Guatemalan sites, migration may have increased demand for agricultural land, leading to an average annual forest loss of 0.73% during the first decade of the millennium. We suggest that when attractive opportunities exist to invest in agriculture and land expansion, remittances and returnee savings provide fresh capital that is likely to increase pressure on forests. Our study also has implications for the understanding of migration flows; in particular, migration has not implied an exodus out of agriculture for the remaining household members nor for the returning migrants. On the contrary, returning migrants are more likely to be involved in farming activities after their return than they were before leaving.

TI  - A Cost Effective Field Measurement Protocol to Support Lidar-Assisted Carbon Monitoring Programs-Implementing A Prototype Design at Six Different Sites in the United States
T2  - U S Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station General Technical Report PNW-GTR
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the increasing interest in the use of lidar-based remote sensing to support carbon monitoring systems, including those used for measurement, reporting, and verification requirements for REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation) programs in tropical nations, there is a corresponding need for the cost-effective field measurement systems to enable model development and robust assessment of uncertainty in these programs. In this report, we describe an efficient field sampling design and measurement protocol designed to provide field-based estimates of biomass/carbon stored in trees and coarse woody materials to support complex, multilevel carbon monitoring systems using Landsat time series and airborne lidar. Airborne lidar data were collected as a strip sample (single flight lines spaced 5 km apart) at six sites in the United States (Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania/New Jersey, and South Carolina) (298 total flight lines), and about 50 field plots were established within the lidar coverage at each site. Field plots were distributed across 15 (3 cover x 5 height) strata at each site, using field protocols that were consistent with those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Field measurements were collected digitally on personal tablets and uploaded daily into a database. Preliminary regression analyses indicate strong relationships between lidar metrics and tree biomass at all sites.

TI  - Mapping water salinity using Landsat-8 OLI satellite images (Case study: Karun basin located in Iran)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water salinity is a key physical parameter that affects water quality, growth, and development of the aquatic vegetation and animals. The salinity of Karun River has been increasing due to some critical factors, e.g., severe climate condition and regional physiography, industrial sources, domestic and urban sewerage, irrigation of agricultural land, fish hatchery, hospital sewage, and high tide level of Persian Gulf. This study aimed at building regression models to ascertain the water salinity through the relationship between the reflectance of the Landsat-8 OLI and In situ measurements. Accordingly, 102 In situ measurements have been collected from June 2013 to July 2018 along the Karun River, subsequently measured data was divided into 70:30 for training and test purposes. Besides, the Sobol' sensitivity analysis was applied to determine the best bands combination from the performance standpoint. The results of the Sobol' sensitivity analysis revealed that band 1-Coastal/Aerosol (0.433-0.453 mu m), band 2-Blue (0.450-0.515 mu m) and band 3-Green (0.525-0. 600 mu m) are the best combinations and showed that Landsat-8 OLI band 2 has the closest correlation with the salinity. Furthermore, to have a comprehensive investigation, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) methods were applied. The number of layers and nodes in the MLP neural network is optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), and GA has selected four layers and thirty neurons per layer. The OLS, SVR and MLP + GA models resulted in values of R-2 and RMSE for test data, which are respectively obtained to be 0.68 and 411 mu s cm(-1), 0.72 and 376 its cm(-1) and 0.78 and 363 mu s cm(-1). Therefore, MLP + GA has had the best performance and accuracy. However, the corresponding values are acceptable considering the fact that the range of field data extensively changes from 385 and 4310. Eventually, water salinity maps were prepared by OLS, SVR and MLP + GA methods to demonstrate the water salinity on 1 February 2015 and 5 September 2018, afterward change detection maps were prepared to assess the water salinity on 1 February 2015 and 5 September 2018. The change detection maps illustrate that the pertinent salinity on 5 September 2018 is lower as compared to the data obtained on 1 February 2015, because not only the rainfall has increased, but the cane sugar cultivation has also decreased which is one of the effective factors on the salinity of the water.

TI  - Earth Observation for the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 11 Indicators at Local Scale: Monitoring of the Migrant Population Distribution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 indicators, at local scale, useful in monitoring urban social resilience. For this purpose, the study focused on updating the distribution map of the migrant population regularly residing in Bari and a neighboring town in Southern Italy. The area is exposed to increasing migration fluxes. The method implemented was based on the integration of Sentinel-2 imagery and updated census information dated 1 January 2019. The study explored a vector-based variant of the dasymetric mapping approach previously used by the Joint Research Center (JRC) within the Data for Integration initiative (D4I). The dasymetric variant implemented can disaggregate data from census areas into a uniform spatial grid by preserving the information complexity of each output grid cell and ensure lower computational costs. The spatial distribution map of regular migrant population obtained, along with other updated ancillary data, were used to quantify, at local level, SDG 11 indicators. In particular, the map of regular migrant population living in inadequate housing (SDG 11.1.1) and the ratio of land consumption rate to regular migrant population growth rate (SDG 11.3.1) were implemented as specific categories of SDG 11 in 2018. At the local level, the regular migrant population density map and the SDG 11 indicator values were provided for each 100 x 100 m cell of an output grid. Obtained for 2018, the spatial distribution map revealed in Bari a high increase of regular migrant population in the same two zones of the city already evidenced in 2011. These zones are located in central parts of the city characterized by urban decay and abandoned buildings. In all remaining city zones, only a slight generalized increase was evidenced. Thus, these findings stress the need for adequate policies to reduce the ongoing process of residential urban segregation. The total of disaggregated values of migrant population evidenced an increase of 44.5% in regular migrant population. The indicators obtained could support urban planners and decision makers not only in the increasing migration pressure management, but also in the local level monitoring of Agenda 2030 progress related to SDG 11.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Messy Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the satellite image clustering. Messy GA allows to maintain a long schema, due to the fact that schema can be expressed with a variable length of codes, so that more suitable cluster can be found in comparison to the existing Simple GA clustering. The results with simulation data show that the proposed Messy GA based clustering shows four times better cluster separability in comparison to the Simple GA while the results with Landsat TM data of Saga show almost 65% better clustering performance.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of land change activities and post-disturbance dynamics from Landsat time series: A test methodology for REDD plus reporting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The REDD+ mechanism of UNFCCC was established to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by means of financial incentives. Of importance to the success of REDD+ and similar initiatives is the provision of credible evidence of reductions in the extent of land change activities that release carbon to the atmosphere (e.g. deforestation). The criteria for reporting land change areas and associated emissions within REDD+ stipulate the use of sampling-based approaches, which allow for unbiased estimation and uncertainty quantification. But for economic compensation for emission reductions to be feasible, agreements between participating countries and donors often require reporting every year or every second year. With the rates of land change typically being very small relative to the total study area, sampling-based approaches for estimation of annual or bi-annual areas have proven problematic, especially when comparing area estimates over time. In this paper, we present a methodology for monitoring and estimating areas of land change activity at high temporal resolution that is compliant with international guidelines. The methodology is based on a break detection algorithm applied to time series of Landsat data in the Colombian Amazon between 2001 and 2016. A biennial stratified sampling approach was implemented to (1) remove the bias introduced by the change detection and classification algorithm in mapped areas derived from pixel-counting; and (2) provide confidence intervals for area estimates obtained from the reference data collected for the sample. Our results show that estimating the area of land change, like deforestation, at annual or bi-annual resolution is inherently challenging and associated with high degrees of uncertainty. We found that better precision was achieved if independent sample datasets of reference observations were collected for each time interval for which area estimates are required. The alternative of selecting one sample of continuous reference observations analyzed for inference of area for each time interval did not yield area estimates significantly different from zero. Also, when large stable land covers (primary forest in this case, occupying almost 90% of the study area) are present in the study area in combination with small rates of land change activity, the impact of omission errors in the map used for stratifying the study area will be substantial and potentially detrimental to usefulness of land change studies. The introduction of a buffer stratum around areas of mapped land change reduced the uncertainty in area estimates by up to 98%. Results indicate that the Colombian Amazon has experienced a small but steady decrease in primary forest due to establishment of pastures, with forest-to-pasture conversion reaching 103 +/- 30 kha (95% confidence interval) in the period between 2013 and 2015, corresponding to 0.22% of the study area. Around 29 +/- 17 kha (95% CI) of pastureland that had been abandoned shortly after establishment reverted to secondary forest within the same period. Other gains of secondary forest from more permanent pastures averaged about 12 +/- 11 kha (95% CI), while losses of secondary forest averaged 20 +/- 12 kha (95% CI).

TI  - High-Resolution Inundation Mapping for Heterogeneous Land Covers with Synthetic Aperture Radar and Terrain Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most wide-spread, frequent, and devastating natural disasters that continue to increase in frequency and intensity. Remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and near-real time (NRT) information due to its high-spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation. However, the efficacy of flood inundation mapping with SAR is susceptible to reflections and scattering from a variety of factors including dense vegetation and urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR along with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of inundation in heterogeneous areas. Three machine learning classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual-polarized SAR only and dual-polarized SAR along with HAND to map inundated areas. Three study sites along the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The binary classification analysis (inundated as positive vs. non-inundated as negative) revealed significant improvements when incorporating HAND in several metrics including classification accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive predictive value (PPV), but true negative rate (TNR) fell -14.4%. By incorporating HAND, a significant number of areas with high SAR backscatter but low HAND values were detected as inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected but to a lesser extent as evident in the metrics. This study demonstrates that HAND could be considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.

TI  - <i>Pars pro toto</i>-Remote Sensing Data for the Reconstruction of a Rounded Chalcolithic Site from NE Romania: The Case of Ripiceni-<i>Holm</i> Settlement (Cucuteni Culture)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prehistoric sites in NE Romania are facing major threats more than ever, both from natural and human-induced hazards. One of the main reasons are the climate change determined natural disasters, but human-induced activities should also not be neglected. The situation is critical for Chalcolithic sites, with a very high density in the region and minimal traces at the surface, that are greatly affected by one or more natural hazards and/or anthropic interventions. The case study, Ripiceni-Holm, belonging to Cucuteni culture, is one of the most important Chalcolithic discoveries in the region. It is also the first evidence from Romania of a concentric arrangement of buildings in the proto-urban mega-sites tradition in Cucuteni-Trypillia cultural complex, and a solid piece of evidence in terms of irreversible natural and anthropic destruction. Using archival cartographic material, alongside non-destructive and high-resolution airborne sensing and ground-based geophysical techniques (LiDAR, total field and vertical gradient magnetometry), we managed to detect diachronic erosion processes for 31 years, to identify a complex internal spatial organization of the actual site and to outline a possible layout of the initial extent of the settlement. The erosion was determined with the help of the DSAS tool and highlighted an average erosion rate of 0.96 m/year. The main results argue a high percent of site destruction (approximately 45%) and the presence of an active shoreline affecting the integrity of the cultural layer.

TI  - Characterizing spatial structure of urban tree cover (UTC) and impervious surface cover (ISC) density using remotely sensed data in Osmaniye, Turkey
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees provide a wide range of significant benefits, and their degradation can result in air pollution and floods, and can damage public health and decrease social welfare.The purpose of this research was to estimate the urban tree cover (UTC) and impervious surface cover (ISC) density and to evaluate how they influence forest gain and loss in Turkey. Accordingly, i-Tree Canopy random point sampling and remote sensing methods were applied using the most current Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images of Osmaniye City. The results indicate that the majority (n = 217) of random points were overlapped with buildings on aerial photograph with a percent cover estimate of 34.1 +/- 1.88%. Also, the second highest number of the randomly selected points (n = 166) overlapped with road cover at estimate of 26.1 +/- 1.74%. Grass cover (n = 68), ISC (n = 59), and shrub cover (n = 52) percentages were estimated as 10.7 +/- 1.22%, 9.26 +/- 1.15%, and 8.16 +/- 1.08%, respectively. UTC (n = 41) percentage was estimated as 6.44 +/- 0.97% in the urban city center. The lowest percent cover of randomly selected points was parking lots (n = 34) estimated as 5.34 +/- 0.89%. Also, the forest loss intensity was unevenly distributed and reflected areas with high population density, and forest cover loss was estimated at the highest level on the east side of the city center. The findings of this research suggest that urbanization around the city center of Osmaniye has altered the local vegetative cover due to deforestation activities to create areas for building construction and new developments.

TI  - Swap and Formation of Diasporic Identities in Amiri Baraka's Theater: from Afrocentric Leanings to a Pan-Africanist Worldview
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Amiri Baraka embraces authenticity and moves in the direction of Africa. The latter is fundamentally a founding idea that revolves around ancient African culture, rites, and customs. The idea of Africa greatly rests upon Afrocentricity. Afrocentricity accentuates values of freedom and equality. The Afrocentric identity is an all-embracing identity, since Afrocentricity poses itself as a liberatory ideology. Afrocentricity succeeds authenticity, and both coalesce and grow together. Authenticity calls for the restoration and invigoration of one's cultural features; it requires racial pride and the affirmation of one's choices and goals in life. Authenticity refers to the genuineness of black ingenuity and the exaltation of the black spirit and originality. It posits that blackness is quintessential and not exotic. It emphasizes essential characteristics and traits. From authenticity via Afrocentricity, Baraka shifts to Pan-Africanism, an idea that links internal struggle with Third World militancy and resistance against colonization and global imperialism. Pan-Africanism is essentially a political ideology, which targets colonialism and imperialism and their respective policies of identity formation. Pan-Africanism thereby enlarges the standpoint from which Baraka looks at contemporary America amid racial turmoil and sociopolitical troubles. The central issue is how Baraka effects this transition from authenticity through Afrocentricity to Pan-Africanism. This article traces back the authentication effort and its links to Afrocentric leanings and Pan-African tendencies in relation to identity formation in select plays, ranging essentially from The Motion of History, Madheart, and A Black Mass. What to retain most is that Baraka frequently swaps ideological blocs, searching to contrive an ever counter-identity.

TI  - Diverse estimates of annual maxima daily precipitation in 22 state-of-the-art quasi-global land observation datasets
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observational evidence of precipitation extremes is vital to better understand how these events might change in a future warmer climate. Over the terrestrial regions of a quasi-global domain, we assess the representation of annual maxima of daily precipitation (Rx1day) in 22 observational products gridded at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution and clustered into four categories: station-based in situ, satellite observations with or without a correction to rain gauges, and reanalyses (5, 8, 4 and 5 datasets, respectively). We also evaluate the interproduct spread across the ensemble and within the four clusters, as a measure of observational uncertainty. We find that reanalyses present a heterogeneous representation of Rx1day in particular over the tropics, and their interproduct spread is the highest compared to any other cluster. Extreme precipitation in satellite data broadly compares well with in situ-based data. We find a general better agreement with in situ-based observations and less interproduct spread for the satellite products with a correction to rain gauges compared to the uncorrected products. Given the level of uncertainties associated with the estimation of Rx1day in the observations, none of the datasets can be thought of as the best estimate. Our recommendation is to avoid using reanalyses as observational evidence and to consider in situ and satellite data (the corrected version preferably) in an ensemble of products for a better estimation of precipitation extremes and their observational uncertainties. Based on this we choose a subsample of 10 datasets to reduce the interproduct spread in both the representation of Rx1day and its timing throughout the year, compared to all 22 datasets. We emphasize that the recommendations and selection of datasets given here may not be relevant for different precipitation indices, and other grid resolutions and time scales.

TI  - Surface ozone response to satellite-constrained NO<sub>x</sub> emission adjustments and its implications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Both surface and satellite observations have shown a decrease in NOx emissions in East Asian countries in recent years. In order to reflect the recent NOx emission reduction and to investigate its impact on surface O-3 concentrations in Asian megacities, we adjusted two bottom-up regional emission inventories of which base years are 2006 (E2006) and 2010 (E2010), respectively. We applied direct and relative emission adjustments to both E2006 and E2010 to constrain NOx emissions using OMI NO2 vertical column densities. Except for the relative emission adjustment with E2006, modeling results with adjusted emissions exhibit that NOx emissions over East Asian megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo) in the bottom-up inventories are generally overestimated. When the direct emission adjustment is applied to E2006, model biases in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), South Korea are reduced from 24 ppb to 2 ppb for NOx (=NO+NO2) and from -9 ppb to 0 ppb for O-3. In addition, NO2 model biases in Beijing and Shanghai in China are reduced from 8 ppb to 18 ppb-0 ppb and 1 ppb, respectively. Daily maximum 8-h average O-3 model biases over the same places are decreased by 8 ppb and 14 ppb. Further analyses suggest that the reduction in domestic South Korean NOx emissions plays a significant role in increasing O-3 concentrations in SMA. We conclude that the current strong drive to reduce NOx emissions as part of the strategy to lower particulate matter concentrations in South Korea can account for increased O-3 concentrations in recent years and suggest that more aggressive NOx emissions will be necessary soon.

TI  - Characteristics of Insect Damage in Propagules of Red Mangrove (<i>Rhizophora mangle</i>) from the Gulf of Mexico Coast
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Several species of insects have been found in propagules of species of mangrove forest, but Coccotrypes rhizophorae (Hopkins) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) has been recorded as one of the main pest of Rhizophora mangle (L.) (Malpighiales: Rhizophoraceae). While the species of mangrove is common in the Gulf of Mexico, the insect fauna associated with its propagules and characteristics of the damage they cause are unknown. This study evaluated the relationship between the presence of insects and damage characteristics in R. mangle propagules. Eleven mangrove forest sites in seven municipalities of the state of Veracruz (Mexico) were sampled, and 10 R. mangle propagules were collected from each site (110 in total). We found 192 individual insects of Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera at different stages of development in the propagules; Coleoptera was the most abundant order (64.3%). Qualitative characteristics such as perforations and galleries were not always associated with the presence of insects. However, other damage characteristics such as perforation size and gallery volume were significantly related to insect presence. Gallery volume, estimated as a measure of the intensity of tissue removal, was significantly greater when C. rhizophorae shared the gallery with other species of insects than when the beetle or other insects were found alone in the propagule. The results showed that R. mangle propagules could maintain colonization dynamics in insects of different orders, consuming tissue that jeopardized the survival and establishment of propagules. The damage can increase under stress in R. mangle, caused by environmental factor generating potential damage to tropical sentinel ecosystems that can eventually become irreversible.

TI  - Growth simulation and yield prediction for perennial jujube fruit tree by integrating age into the WOFOST model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mathematical models have been widely employed for the simulation of growth dynamics of annual crops, thereby performing yield prediction, but not for fruit tree species such as jujube tree (Zizyphus jujuba). The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential use of a modified WOFOST model for predicting jujube yield by introducing tree age as a key parameter. The model was established using data collected from dedicated field experiments performed in 2016-2018. Simulated growth dynamics of dry weights of leaves, stems, fruits, total biomass and leaf area index (LAI) agreed well with measured values, showing root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.143, 0.333, 0.366, 0.624 t ha(-1) and 0.19, and R-2 values of 0.947, 0.976, 0.985, 0.986 and 0.95, respectively. Simulated phenological development stages for emergence, anthesis and maturity were 2, 3 and 3 days earlier than the observed values, respectively. In addition, in order to predict the yields of trees with different ages, the weight of new organs (initial buds and roots) in each growing season was introduced as the initial total dry weight (TDWI), which was calculated as averaged, fitted and optimized values of trees with the same age. The results showed the evolution of the simulated LAI and yields profiled in response to the changes in TDWI. The modelling performance was significantly improved when it considered TDWI integrated with tree age, showing good global (R-2 >= 0.856, RMSE <= 0.68 t ha(-1)) and local accuracies (mean R-2 >= 0.43, RMSE <= 0.70 t ha(-1)). Furthermore, the optimized TDWI exhibited the highest precision, with globally validated R-2 of 0.891 and RMSE of 0.591 t ha(-1), and local mean R-2 of 0.57 and RMSE of 0.66 t ha(-1), respectively. The proposed model was not only verified with the confidence to accurately predict yields of jujube, but it can also provide a fundamental strategy for simulating the growth of other fruit trees.

TI  - An Optimized Faster R-CNN Method Based on DRNet and RoI Align for Building Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the increase of satellites and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) has multiplied the amount of remote sensing data available to people, but only a small part of the remote sensing data has been properly used; problems such as land planning, disaster management and resource monitoring still need to be solved. Buildings in remote sensing images have obvious positioning characteristics; thus, the detection of buildings can not only help the mapping and automatic updating of geographic information systems but also have guiding significance for the detection of other types of ground objects in remote sensing images. Aiming at the deficiency of traditional building remote sensing detection, an improved Faster R-CNN (region-based Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm was proposed in this paper, which adopts DRNet (Dense Residual Network) and RoI (Region of Interest) Align to utilize texture information and to solve the region mismatch problems. The experimental results showed that this method could reach 82.1% mAP (mean average precision) for the detection of landmark buildings, and the prediction box of building coordinates was relatively accurate, which improves the building detection results. Moreover, the recognition of buildings in a complex environment was also excellent.

TI  - Interpreting politically-charged numerical information: The influence of numeracy and problem difficulty on response accuracy
T2  - JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING
M3  - Article
AB  - People who possess greater mathematical skills (i.e., numeracy) are generally more accurate in interpreting numerical data than less numerate people. However, recent evidence has suggested that more numerate people may use their numerical skills to interpret data only if their initial interpretation conflicts with their worldview. That is, if an initial, intuitive (but incorrect) interpretation of data appears to disconfirm one's beliefs, then numerical skills are used to further process the data and reach the correct interpretation, whereas numerical skills are not used in situations where an initial incorrect interpretation of the data appears to confirm one's beliefs (i.e., motivated numeracy). In the present study, participants were presented with several data problems, some with correct answers confirming their political views and other disconfirming their views. The difficulty of these problems was manipulated to examine how numeracy would influence the rate of correct responses on easier vs. more difficult problems. Results indicated that participants were more likely to answer problems correctly if the correct answer confirmed rather than disconfirmed their political views, and this response pattern did not depend on problem difficulty or numerical skill. Although more numerate participants were more accurate overall, this was true both for problems in which the correct answer confirmed and disconfirmed participants' political views.

TI  - Rejection of Communist Ideology in Liem Khing Hoo's <i>Merah</i> (1937): <i>An Examination via Genetic Structuralism</i>
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Merah (1937) is a work of Chinese Malay literature that explores issues of communism through the story of a labour strike in Kudus. There have been different opinions regarding communism, and such diversity is embodied in different works. Among Peranakan Chinese themselves at the time, interest in communism was rather lukewarm. Amidst this condition, Liem Khing Hoo wrote a communism-related novel, and this signifies the writing's uniqueness. This research examined how Liem Khing Hoo's particular worldview of communism was applied and emerged within the literary work. Using the sociology of literature approach espoused in Lucien Goldmann's Genetic Structuralism, it was discovered that this literary work rejected communism. In addition, there were also no signs of efforts to eradicate class domination as the text strongly advocated for the humane treatment of labourers. Through this research, it is proven that Liem positions himself on the side of labour without aligning with communism and its mission of class eradication. Liem's rejection of communist ideology is homologous to the worldview of his ethnic group, Peranakan Chinese, implying that the labour movement does not perpetually contradict capitalism.

TI  - Studies on ecosystem function and dynamics in Indian sub-continent and emerging applications of satellite remote sensing technique
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The capacity of an ecosystem to sustain a specific function depends on its structural dynamics and interplay of several extrinsic factors with its functional components. The study of mechanisms involved in the dynamics of an ecosystem, and a critical evaluation of these mechanisms are fundamental to address various challenges that the ecosystems are facing today e.g. changing environment and socio-economic forces. In this thematic issue, we present 15 articles, which deal with such diverse functional attributes of an ecosystem as nutrient cycling, hydrology, biomass and carbon. The structural dynamics include forest and land use changes, and changes in fuel wood extraction and diversity patterns. The articles are arranged in three sections viz., Ecosystem Function, Ecosystem Dynamics, and Biomass and Carbon. At least 65% of these articles have used satellite remote sensing technique. We realize that the utilization of satellite remote sensing data has been emerging as a dominant trend in tropical ecological studies in Indian sub-continent.

T2  - CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this study was to identify areas prone to groundwater exploration in the Anar-Dashtegol anticline, southwest of Iran. The fractal geometry was used to determine the linearity density in the areas. In the first step, the groundwater conditioning factors, such as distance from faults and fractures, faults and fractures density, distance from springs, spring discharge, relief, and slopes were prepared. Lineament density map was spatially prepared using fractal geometry, box-counting method. Thematic map of each parameter was prepared using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data. Measuring the rate and weight of the maps was performed using the crisp method on a scale from 0 to 9 and analytical hierarchical process (AHP), respectively. The final output map showed different zones of groundwater prospective potential, which was divided into four orders: very low, low, moderate, and high. Results indicate that precipitation, faults, and relief are the most affecting factors on karst water potential at the Anar-Dashtegol anticline, and that areas with high potential are located in northern plunge. Karstic wells present in the study area have confirmed that zones with high groundwater potential identified from the study developed here are characterized by a high yield.

TI  - HYDROBIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF TRIBUTARIES OF THE VYCHEGDA RIVER BASIN IN DIFFERENT UNITS OF LANDSCAPE DIVISION.
T2  - Principy Ekologii
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of natural conditions of landscape complexes, differences in the geological structure and relief of the catchment areas of the Vychegda river basin are the basis for the formation of the main hydrobiological characteristics of its tributaries. To differentiate small and medium-sized tributaries of the Vychegda River, it was proposed to use zoning based on differences in the structure of the geological foundation, geomorphology, modern relief, soil-forming rocks and vegetation cover. The results of segmentation of Landsat image mosaic were used to analyze the distribution features of dominant terrestrial ecosystems within the basin. The results of hydrobiological and hydrochemical observations on 59 small and medium-sized rivers within the selected landscape complexes of the Luzhsko-Vychegodsky and Vychegodsko-Mezensky plains and the Timansky ridge were presented. A review of the results of long-term hydrobiological observations on watercourses of the Vychegda River basin with hydrochemical and biological characteristics of plankton and bottom communities was given. It was stated that the landscape confinement of small and medium-sized tributaries of the Vychegda River determined the characteristics of water communities. Ordination of the results of measurements of the number and mass of benthos by the method of multidimensional non-metric scaling (NMDS) showed the presence and formation of polar cores in terms of total population and biomass for the Vychegodsko-Mezensky and Timansky landscape areas. An intermediate position is occupied by the group of the Luzsko-Vychegodsky plain. The variety of environmental conditions of small and medium-sized watercourses caused mutual "penetrations" and the blurred nature of the selected groups. There was no pronounced differentiation found for the zooplankton characteristics.

TI  - Does deforestation increase malaria prevalence? Evidence from satellite data and health surveys
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation can increase malaria risk factors such as mosquito growth rates and biting rates in some settings. But deforestation affects more than mosquitoes-it is associated with socio-economic changes that affect malaria rates in humans. Most previous studies have found that deforestation is associated with increased malaria prevalence, suggesting that in some cases forest conservation might belong in a portfolio of anti-malarial interventions. However, previous peer-reviewed studies of deforestation and malaria were based on a small number of geographically aggregated observations, mostly from the Brazilian Amazon. Here we combine 14 years of high-resolution satellite data on forest loss with individual-level and nationally representative malaria tests for more than 60,000 rural children in 17 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 88% of malaria cases occur. Adhering to methods that we prespecified in a pre-analysis plan, we used multiple regression analysis to test ex-ante hypotheses derived from previous literature. Aggregated across countries, we did not find either deforestation or intermediate levels of forest cover to be associated with higher malaria prevalence. In nearly all (n = 78/84) country-year-specific regressions, we also did not find deforestation or intermediate levels of forest cover to be associated with higher malaria prevalence. However, we can not rule out associations at the local scale or beyond the geographic scope of our study region. We speculate that our findings may differ from those of previous studies because deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa is largely driven by the steady expansion of smallholder agriculture for domestic use by long-time residents in stable socio-economic settings where malaria is already endemic and previous exposure is high, while in much of Latin America and Asia deforestation is driven by rapid clearing for market-driven agricultural exports by new frontier migrants without previous exposure. These differences across regions suggest useful hypotheses to test in future research. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - TURK PEDIATRI ARSIVI-TURKISH ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Malignant melanoma is the most frequent skin cancer in children and adolescents. It comprises 1-3% of all malignancies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical aspects, histopathologic features, and treatment outcomes of our patients with malignant melanoma.Material and Methods: Patients aged <15 years who were treated between 2003 and 2018 for malignant melanoma were retrospectively analyzed.Results: Seventeen patients (10 females, 7 males), with a median age of 7 years (range, 7 months-13 years) were evaluated. Five patients had congenital melanocytic nevi. All had cutaneous melanoma except one with mucosal (conjunctival) melanoma. The most frequent primary tumor site was the lower extremities (35%). Sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, sentinel node biopsy, and PET/CT were performed as the staging procedures at initial diagnosis. Localized disease was present in eight patients; nine had regional lymph node metastasis. The only treatment was surgery in localized disease; surgery and adjuvant interferon treatment was given in patients with regional lymph node metastasis. Three developed distant metastasis (bone, lung, brain) at a median of 9 months. A three-year-old patient received a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib), and a 13-year-old patient received a check point inhibitor (ipilimumab); both died of progressive disease. The median follow-up for all patients was 25 months. The 5-year overall survival was 76.6%.Conclusion: Although malignant melanoma is rare in children, prognosis is good if diagnosed early. Physicians should be aware of skin lesions and full-layer biopsy should be obtained in suspicious skin lesions. Patients with congenital melanocytic nevi should also be followed up cautiously.

TI  - Retrieval of land surface properties from an annual time series of Landsat TOA radiances during a drought episode using coupled radiative transfer models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate retrieval of land surface vegetation properties under varying environmental conditions from time series of moderately high spatial resolution satellite observations is challenging. By coupling various Radiative Transfer (RT) models one can describe the soil, vegetation and atmosphere contributions in a "bottom-up" approach and, thereby, simulate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data comparable to satellite-observed TOA radiances. This makes it possible to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA radiances rather than from atmospherically corrected top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance data. The advantages of this approach are that a separate atmospheric correction of the satellite images is not necessary, and that the anisotropic surface reflection can also be taken into account effectively. In this study, we coupled various RT models, including the brightness - shape - moisture (BSM) reflectance model of the soil, the optical radiative transfer (RTMo) model of vegetation and the 'MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission' (MODTRAN) model of the atmosphere, to simulate an annual time series of Landsat satellite TOA radiances observed during a drought episode in California Mediterranean grasslands in 2004. The inversion of this coupled system through an optimization technique against Landsat TOA radiances resulted in direct retrieval of vegetation properties. We accommodated the surface anisotropic reflection in our coupled modeling and also defined a novel anisotropy index to quantitatively express the importance of this phenomenon in satellite image analysis for the first time. Our study showed that the coupled use of RT models was able to accurately reproduce the time series of observed TOA radiances collected under varying soil moisture contents during an extended drought episode. The proposed coupling approach is useful for successful retrieval of vegetation properties from time series of satellite TOA radiance data to produce maps of land surface properties and to monitor vegetation properties variations in an operational straightforward way. The approach can also be easily adapted for conducting multi-sensor time series studies, creating a much denser temporal sampling than would be possible for separate single sensors.

TI  - Interactions Between Air Pollution and Pollen Season for Rhinitis Using Mobile Technology: A MASK-POLLAR Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY-IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested an interaction between air pollution and pollen exposure with an impact on allergy symptoms. However, large studies with real-life data are not available.OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between major air pollutants (ozone and particulate matter with a diameter of <2.5 mm) and allergic rhinitis (AR) control during grass and birch pollen seasons as well as outside the pollen season.METHODS: The daily impact of allergic symptoms was recorded by the Allergy Diary (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK [MASK-air]) app (a validated mHealth tool for rhinitis management) using visual analog scales (VASs) in Northern and Central Europe users in 2017 and 2018. Uncontrolled AR was defined using symptoms and medications. Pollutant levels were assessed using the System for Integrated modeLing of Atmospheric coMposition database. Pollen seasons were assessed by regions using Google Trends. Generalized estimating equation models were used to account for repeated measures per user, adjusting for sex, age, treatment, and country. Analyses were stratified by pollen seasons to investigate interactions between air pollutants and pollen exposure.RESULTS: A total of 3323 geolocated individuals (36,440 VAS-days) were studied. Associations between uncontrolled rhinitis and pollutants were stronger during the grass pollen season. Days with uncontrolled AR increased by 25% for an inter-quartile range increase in ozone levels during the grass pollen season (odds ratio of 1.25 [95% CI, 1.11-1.41] in 2017 and of 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.25] in 2018). A similar trend was found for particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 mu m, especially in 2017.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the relationship between uncontrolled AR and air pollution is modified by the presence of grass pollens. This study confirms the impact of pollutants in the grass pollen season but not in the birch pollen season. (C) 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

TI  - Three decades of variability in California's giant kelp forests from the Landsat satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global, repeat satellite imagery serves as an essential tool to understand ecological patterns and processes over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Recently, the use of spaceborne imagery has become indispensable for monitoring giant kelp, a globally distributed foundation species that displays variable seasonal and interannual dynamics. In order to develop and maintain a continuous and spatially expansive time series, we describe a fully automated protocol to classify giant kelp canopy biomass across three Landsat sensors. This required correcting kelp canopy estimates to account for changes in the spectral response functions between the three sensors by simulating data using hyperspectral imagery. Combining multiple sensors also necessitated the use of an extended (15 year) time series of diver estimated kelp biomass to validate each sensor. We also describe a novel gap filling technique using known spatial scales of kelp biomass synchrony to correct for missing data due to the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus scan line corrector failure. These developments have led to a publicly available 34-year, seasonal time series of kelp canopy biomass across similar to 1500 km of California coastline.We then use this time series to examine the role of temporal and spatial scale on the detection of long-term biomass trends. We found that kelp canopy biomass trends are associated with trends in low frequency marine climate oscillations, like the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Long-term (similar to 20 year) increases in the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have led to a cooler, nutrient-rich environment that benefits the growth of giant kelp across a large portion of the kelp biomass time series, however recent warming events have led to weak, or nonexistent trends over the length of the time series. The cyclical nature of these low frequency marine climate oscillations complicates the detection of trends that may be associated with anthropogenic climate change. A longer and continuous time series is needed to analyze long-term canopy biomass trends outside of natural low frequency climate variability for giant kelp ecosystems along the coast of California, if we are to make accurate assessments of the impacts of climate change.

TI  - NDVI indicated changes in vegetation and their relations to climatic comfort factors in Demre-Akcay Sub basin, Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vegetation change obtained by NDVI analysis and climatic comfort factors by using an artificial neural network model. Methodology: Fethiye, Elmali, Ka, Finike, Kemer, Korkuteli, Antalya, Tefenni and Kale climatic station's temperature, humidity and wind data were evaluated during this study. Moreover, four Landsat TM satellite images (2006 - 2016) were used as 2 for each year to detect Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Climatic comfort maps were created by ArcMap10.3 software using Kriging Method. Difference maps for climatic comfort and NDVI values of satellite images between 2006 - 2016 were created. At the pixel scale, these data were used for teaching artificial neural network model by Neural Designer software in randomly selected 500 points. All NDVI values (-1 -1) and possible vegetation changes (-1 -1) that could occurs in the study area were entered as input to the trained neural network model and the possible values of climate comfort change values were determined.Results: Most significant 2006 NDVI average and mean values were observed at 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5. In the value of NDVI in 2016 forecast, climatic comfort values could get higher in an area which can change into a mediocre or low vegetation value. The maximum average and mean values were 1.0, 0.9 and 0.8. This forecast shows that there could be positive and negative major changes between the climatic comfort values that may occur.Interpretation: Artificial neural networks are the recent ways for such studies and are rapidly developing. Understanding artificial neural networks boundaries and advantages will allow for more efficient modeling tools. As in every part of life, the use of artificial neural networks is expected to increase day by day in landscape planning and design studies.

TI  - Land-Cover Changes to Surface-Water Buffers in the Midwestern USA: 25 Years of Landsat Data Analyses (1993-2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the timing, extent, and magnitude of land use/land cover (LULC) change in buffer areas surrounding Midwestern US waters, we analyzed the full imagery archive (1982-2017) of three Landsat footprints covering similar to 100,000 km(2). The study area included urbanizing Chicago, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri regions and agriculturally dominated landscapes (i.e., Peoria, Illinois). The Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm identified 1993-2017 LULC change across three Landsat footprints and in 90 m buffers for similar to 110,000 surface waters; waters were also size-binned into five groups for buffer LULC change analyses. Importantly, buffer-area LULC change magnitude was frequently much greater than footprint-level change. Surface-water extent in buffers increased by 14-35x the footprint rate and forest decreased by 2-9x. Development in buffering areas increased by 2-4x the footprint-rate in Chicago and Peoria area footprints but was similar to the change rate in the St. Louis area footprint. The LULC buffer-area change varied in waterbody size, with the greatest change typically occurring in the smallest waters (e.g., <0.1 ha). These novel analyses suggest that surface-water buffer LULC change is occurring more rapidly than footprint-level change, likely modifying the hydrology, water quality, and biotic integrity of existing water resources, as well as potentially affecting down-gradient, watershed-scale storages and flows of water, solutes, and particulate matter.

TI  - STRATEGIES, ARGUMENTS, LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES IN THE CRIMINAL DEFENSE IN THE MAPUCHE ARAUCANIA OF CHILE
T2  - CHUNGARA-REVISTA DE ANTROPOLOGIA CHILENA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the development of a criminal defense case that took place in Chile's Araucania Region in 2013, and in which a Mapuche man was convicted of femicide. The man's legal defense was provided by the specialized Mapuche Public Defender's office. In this article we examine the legal defense provided to this man, the manner in which the specific socio-cultural conditions were taken into account, the theoretical and methodological frameworks and juridical resources considered in the defense's arguments, and the internal limitations met by said arguments in terms of the judicial conviction. Our analysis covers the defense's actions, the arguments presented by the defense, and the assimilation of exculpatory legal categories and of categories of understanding that are typical of the Mapuche cognitive and medical worldview. This case is especially interesting because it allows us to recognize a specific type of socio-cultural legal defense and to derive lessons that can inform a pluralistic and fair legal theory and practice in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural contexts such as the Chilean society today.

TI  - Level III dissection in locally advanced breast cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a retrospective study
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in India, and 30-60% of patients present with locally advanced breast cancer. Level III clearance is routinely performed in India in locally advanced breast cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, even in clinical complete response. We analysed our data of patients with locally advanced breast cancer post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy who have undergone level III clearance to identify any subgroup in which level III dissection can be avoided.MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of female patients with locally advanced breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent breast surgery including level III nodal clearance between June 2016 and May 2018. Data collected included age, menopausal status, TNM stage at presentation, grade, estrogen, progesterone, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, response to treatment, post-chemotherapy stage and final histopathology. Uni- and multivariate analysis was undertaken.RESULTS Data from 200 patients was analysed. The level III positivity rate was 15.5%. The clinical complete response rate was 43%, of which 41% had pathological complete response. A significant association was present between level III node positivity and pathological T stage (p=0.03). No association was seen between level III positivity and any other studied variables. In the subset of patients with cT3N1 and cT2N2, level III positivity was seen in only 3/49 (6.1%) and 1/31 (3%), respectively.CONCLUSION Level III positivity rate is high and so cannot be avoided in locally advanced breast cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. None of the preoperative factors predict for level III positivity. Level III positivity in cT3N1 and cT2N2 is low and these subgroups require further studies.

TI  - Site-specific irrigation management in a sub-humid climate using a spatial evapotranspiration model with satellite and airborne imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) considers spatial variability in soil and plant characteristics to optimize irrigation management in agricultural fields. The advent of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) creates an opportunity to utilize high-resolution (spatial and temporal) imagery into irrigation management due to decreasing costs, ease of operation, and reduction of regulatory constraints. This research aimed to evaluate the use of UAS data for VRI, and to quantify the potential of VRI in terms of relative crop and water response. Irrigation treatments were: (1) VRI using Landsat imagery (VRI-L), (2) VRI using UAS imagery (VRI-U), (3) uniform (U), and (4) rainfed (R). An updated remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration and water balance model, incorporating soil water measurements, was used to make prescriptions for the VRI treatments at a field site in eastern Nebraska. In 2017, the mean prescribed seasonal irrigation depth (I-p) for VRI-L was significantly greater (alpha = 0.05) than the I-p for U for soybean. In 2018, I-p for soybean was greatest for VRI-U treatment followed by the U and VRI-L treatments, with all being significantly different from each other. No significant differences in I-p for maize were observed in 2017 or 2018. In all crop-year combinations, the VRI and U treatments had significantly greater evapotranspiration (ET) than the R treatment. Yield differences among treatments were not significant (except for rainfed maize compared to VRI-L in 2017). For maize in 2017, IWUE for VRI-L was comparable to the U treatment. The UAS imagery was a better match for the scale of crop management than Landsat imagery, particularly for thermal data. The multispectral UAS data was successfully used in the crop coefficient ET model for real-time irrigation, but using UAS to determine accurate canopy temperatures for surface energy balance modeling remains a challenge.

TI  - Role of one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) to detect sentinel lymph node low-volume metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionGrowing evidence in the literature supports the accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a rapid assay able to detect cytokeratin 19-mRNA in SLNs, and it can be used for intra-operative detection of low-volume metastases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of low-volume metastasis in SLNs detected by OSNA in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Secondary aims were to define the sensitivity and the negative predictive value of SLN biopsy assessed with OSNA.MethodsAfter IRB approval, consecutive patients who underwent surgery for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA1 with lymph-vascular space involvement to IB1 between November 2017 and July 2019 and had SLN biopsy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were included. SLNs were detected with indocyanine-green cervical injection and sent intra-operatively for OSNA.ResultsEighteen patients underwent SLN assessment with OSNA and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy in the study period. Four (22.2%) patients had unilateral and 14 (77.8%) had bilateral mapping. OSNA detected micro-metastasis in 6/18 (33.3%) patients. All micro-metastases were detected in patients with bilateral SLN mapping. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of SLN in detecting lymph node metastasis with OSNA calculated per pelvic sidewall were 85.7% and 96.1%, respectively. The false negative rate in mapped sidewalls was 14.3%.DiscussionThis is the first series entirely processing SLNs for OSNA in early-stage cervical cancer. OSNA is able to intra-operatively detect low-volume metastases in SLNs. Further studies are necessary to confirm the accuracy of this technique and to assess survival implications of low-volume metastases detected by OSNA.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of land use/cover changes in the Pra River Basin, Ghana
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pra River Basin, located in South Central Ghana, is a forest basin that is reported of being threatened with land degradation activities. This study evaluates past and present land use pattern of the basin and determines the spatial variation of land cover classes across it sub-basins. Landsat images, 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2018, were classified using the spectral angle mapping technique. Six land use classes were identified and classified, namely, closed forest, open forest, farm/grassland, settlement, mining, and water. The results showed that the basin has been experiencing changes in the spatial patterns and distribution of LULC classes. Generally, closed forest and open forest decreased with mean values of 10% and 11% respectively, towards settlement, farming, and mining which increased with mean values of 7.8%, 12.4%, and 1.0% respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the change in land use classes varied across the sub-basins. Settlement increased consistently in all the sub-basins; however, Oda and Upper Ofin increased greatly towards peri-urban residential and commercial land uses. Similarly, illegal mining activities recorded severe increase in Anum, Birim, Lower Ofin, and Twifu Praso sub-basins. Farm/grassland increased specifically in Lower Pra, Assin Praso, Twifo Praso, Birim, and Upper Ofin sub-basins. The main drivers identified in the study includes population growth and migration, response to socio-economic conditions and policies, and availability of mineral resources. The study illustrates the importance of sub-basin analysis in pinpointing areas at risk for both basin and local level management.

T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - News organizations constitute key sites of science communication between experts and lay audiences, giving many individuals their basic worldview of complex topics like climate change. Previous researchers have studied climate change news coverage to assess accuracy in reporting and potential sources of bias. These studies typically rely on manually coding articles from a handful of prestigious outlets, not allowing comparisons with smaller newspapers or providing enough diversity to assess the influence of partisan orientation or localized climate vulnerability on content production. Making these comparisons, this study indicates that partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and vulnerability to climate change correlate with several topics present in U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change. After assembling a corpus of over 78,000 articles covering two decades from 52 U.S. newspapers that are diverse in terms of geography, partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and objectively measured climate risk, a coherent set of latent topics were identified via an automated content analysis of climate change news coverage. Topic model results indicate that while outlet bias does not appear to impact the prevalence of coverage for most topics surrounding climate change, differences were evident for some topics based on partisan orientation, scale, or vulnerability status, particularly those relating to climate change denial, impacts, mitigation, or resource use. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive study of U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change and identifies specific topics where outlet bias constitutes an important contextual factor.

TI  - Pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer-a simplified algorithm based on histology and lymphatic anatomy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo achieve the full potential of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in endometrial cancer, both presumed low- and high-risk groups should be included. Perioperative resource use and complications should be minimized. Knowledge on distribution and common anatomical sites for metastatic SLNs may contribute to optimizing the concept while maintaining sensitivity. Proceeding from previous studies, simplified algorithms based on histology and lymphatic anatomy are proposed.MethodsData on mapping rates and locations of pelvic SLNs (metastatic and non-metastatic) from two previous prospective SLN studies in women with endometrial cancer were retrieved. Cervically injected indocyanine green was used as a tracer and an ipsilateral re-injection was performed in case of non-display of the upper and/or lower paracervical pathways. A systematic surgical algorithm was followed with clearly defined SLNs depicted on an anatomical chart. In high-risk endometrial cancer patients, removal of SLNs was followed by a pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.Results423 study records were analyzed. The bilateral mapping rates of the upper and lower paracervical pathways were 88.9% and 39.7%, respectively. 72% of all SLNs were typically positioned along the upper paracervical pathway (interiliac and/or proximal obturator fossa) and 71 of 75 (94.6%) of pelvic node positive women had at least one metastatic SLN at either of these positions. Women with grade 1-2 endometroid cancers (n=275) had no isolated metastases along the lower paracervical pathway compared with two women with high-risk histologies (n=148).ConclusionSLNs along the upper paracervical pathway should be identified in all endometrial cancer histological subtypes; removal of nodes at defined typical positions along the upper paracervical pathway may replace a site-specific lymphadenectomy in case of non-mapping despite tracer re-injection. Detection of SLNs along the lower paracervical pathway can be restricted to high-risk histologies and a full pre-sacral lymphadenectomy should be performed in case of non-display.

TI  - Identification of dust sources using long term satellite and climatic data: A case study of Tigris and Euphrates basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are considered as one of the most important environmental challenges in the West Asia region. In addition to the harmful impacts of dust storms on human health, they also have particular effects on socioeconomic and agroecological domains of human communities. Identify the sources of dust storms is the first step to combat against these devastating phenomena. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to determine dust sources of the Tigris and Euphrates basin using satellite and climatic data. Monthly LST and NDVI of MODIS, monthly wind speed, soil moisture, and absolute air humidity data from GLDAS, monthly TRMM precipitation, and soil texture data of FAO were used. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was applied to determine the weights of the collected data (i.e. criteria or drivers for dust storms formation). Susceptible Areas to Dust Storm Formation (SADSF) were determined using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) model for months of June, July, and August from 2000 to 2017. After performing SADSF analysis, five main dust sources were identified in the whole basin. To evaluate the accuracy of the results, the number of real Observed Dust Storms (ODS) in each source was compared to the repetition of allocation in SADSF for each pixel over the 18-year period of this study from 2000 to 2017. Results indicated that the area of SADSF has significantly grown for all three months since 2008. The areas of SADSF in June and July were almost the same, while they were significantly bigger than August. Among identified dust sources, the highest SADSF repetition was in the northwest of Iraq followed by eastern Syria, southern Iraq, southeast border of Iraq, and east border of Iraq, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the SADSF repetition with the number of ODS events in those recognized dust sources was equal to 0.88, 0.76, and 0.74 for June, July, and August, respectively, that shows the accuracy of our results in comparison to actual data.

TI  - Airborne-laser-scanning-derived auxiliary information discriminating between broadleaf and conifer trees improves the accuracy of models for predicting timber volume in mixed and heterogeneously structured forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing forests for ecosystem services and biodiversity requires accurate and spatially explicit forest inventory data. A major objective of forest management inventories is to estimate the standing timber volume for certain forest areas. In order to improve the efficiency of an inventory, field based sample-plots can be statistically combined with remote sensing data. Such models usually incorporate auxiliary variables derived from canopy height models. The inclusion of forest type variables, which quantify broadleaf and conifer volume proportions, has been shown to further improve model performance. Currently, the most common way of quantifying broadleaf and conifer forest types is by calculating the proportions of the corresponding areas of the canopy cover. This practice works well for single-layer forests with only a few species, but we hypothesized that this is not best practice for heterogeneously structured and mixed forests, where the area proportion does not accurately reflect the timber volume proportion. To better represent the broadleaf and conifer volume proportions, we introduced two new auxiliary variables in which the area proportion is weighted by height information from a canopy height model.The main objectives of this study were: (1) to demonstrate the advantage of including forest type (broadleaf/conifer distinction) information in ordinary least squares regression models for timber volume prediction using widely available data sources, and (2) to investigate the hypothesis that including the broadleaf and conifer proportions, weighted by canopy height information, as additional auxiliary variables is favourable over including simple area proportions. The study was conducted in three areas in Switzerland, all of which have heterogeneously structured and mixed forests. Our main findings were that the best model performance can generally be achieved: (1) by deriving conifer and broadleaf proportions from a high-resolution broadleaf/conifer map derived from leaf-off airborne laser scanning data, and (2) by using broadleaf/conifer proportions weighted by height information from a canopy height model. Incorporating the so-derived conifer and broadleaf proportions increased the model accuracy by up to 9 percentage points in root mean square error (RMSE) compared with models not using any forest type information, and by up to 2 percentage points in RMSE compared with models using conifer and broadleaf proportions based solely on the corresponding area proportions, as done in current practice. Our findings are particularly relevant for mixed and heterogeneously structured forests, such as those managed to achieve multiple functions or to adapt effectively to climate change.

TI  - Global Wetting by Seasonal Surface Water Over the Last Decades
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water bodies and their changes in the landscape are critical for societies and ecosystems. However, the global change in surface water area over the last decades remains unclear, as recent studies using the same satellite data disagree on its direction. Here, we reanalyze reported maps of global water classification based on that data in order to estimate the changes in long-term average surface water area from the first (1985-2000) to the second (2001-2015) half of the recent 30-year period (1985-2015). We find a net gain in global surface water area by 100,454 km(2), primarily due to seasonal water gains (83,329 km(2)). Over the world, we identify net wetting in 187 and net drying in 57 regional hydrological catchments, with the greatest water gain in Sabarmati (India) and loss in Amu Darya (Uzbekistan). We provide an interactive map to further explore the highly heterogeneous local changes around the world.

TI  - Application of remote sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms in dust source detection and dust source susceptibility mapping
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research was to develop a method to produce a Dust Source Susceptibility Map (DSSM). For this purpose, we applied remote sensing and statistical-based machine learning algorithms for experimental dust storm studies in the Khorasan Razavi Province, in north-eastern Iran. We identified dust sources in the study area using MODIS satellite images during the 2005-2016 period. For dust source identification, four indices encompassing BTD3132, BTD2931, NDDI, and D variable for 23 MODIS satellite images were calculated. As a result, 65 dust source points were identified, which were categorized into dust source data points for training and validation of the machine learning algorithms. Three statistical-based machine learning algorithms were used including Weights of Evidence (WOE), Frequency Ratio (FR), and Random Forest (RF) to produce DSSM for the study region. We used land use, lithology, slope, soil, geomorphology, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and distance from river as conditioning variables in the modelling. To check the performance of the models, we applied the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). As for the AUC success rate (training), the FR and WOE algorithms resulted in 82 and 83% accuracy, respectively, while the RF algorithm resulted in 91% accuracy. As for the AUC predictive rate (validation), the accuracy of all three models, FR, WOE, and RF, were 80, 81, and 88%, respectively. Although all three algorithms produced acceptable susceptibility maps of dust sources, the results indicated better performance of the RF algorithm.

TI  - Assessment of Workflow Feature Selection on Forest LAI Prediction with Sentinel-2A MSI, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel-2A (S2A) mission is providing time series that allow the characterisation of dynamic vegetation, especially when combined with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 7 (L7) and Landsat 8 (L8) missions. Hybrid retrieval workflows combining non-parametric Machine Learning Regression Algorithms (MLRAs) and vegetation Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) were proposed as fast and accurate methods to infer biophysical parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) from these data streams. However, the exact design of optimal retrieval workflows is rarely discussed. In this study, the impact of five retrieval workflow features on LAI prediction performance of MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations was analysed over a Dutch beech forest site for a one-year period. The retrieval workflow features were the (1) addition of prior knowledge of leaf chemistry (two alternatives), (2) the choice of RTM (two alternatives), (3) the addition of Gaussian noise to RTM produced training data (four and five alternatives), (4) possibility of using Sun Zenith Angle (SZA) as an additional MLRA training feature (two alternatives), and (5) the choice of MLRA (six alternatives). The features were varied in a full grid resulting in 960 inversion models in order to find the overall impact on performance as well as possible interactions among the features. A combination of a Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) time series with litter-trap derived LAI served as independent validation. The addition of absolute noise had the most significant impact on prediction performance. It improved the median prediction Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 1.08 m(2) m(-2) when 5% noise was added compared to inversions with 0% absolute noise. The choice of the MLRA was second most important in terms of median prediction performance, which differed by 0.52 m(2) m(-2) between the best and worst model. The best inversion model achieved an RMSE of 0.91 m(2) m(-2) and explained 84.9% of the variance of the reference time series. The results underline the need to explicitly describe the used noise model in future studies. Similar studies should be conducted in other study areas, both forest and crop systems, in order to test the noise model as an integral part of hybrid retrieval workflows.

TI  - Biomonitoring of <i>Mimachiamys varia</i> transplanted to areas impacted by human activities (La Rochelle Marina, France)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of human activities on French Atlantic coastlines (La Rochelle) lead to chronic pollution of the environment by organic (pesticides, hydrocarbons, agrochemicals) and inorganic (heavy metals) contaminants. These past years, several regulations have been implemented to preserve coastal environments. The purpose of this study was to perform biomonitoring of bivalve species using an outdoor caging technique. The goal of our work was to assess the impact of harbour's trace elements on the state of health of the marine bivalve Mimachlamys varia. First, various molecular defence biomarkers were measured: SOD (oxidative stress), GST (detoxification process), MDA (lipid peroxidation), and Laccase (immune reaction). Thus, in April 2016, scallops were collected at three caging sites, which differ by their levels of pollution, after transplantation into port areas (fairing, rainwater) and a control site (marsh). Bivalve samples were taken at three sampling dates (D0, D07, D21). Biomarker assays were performed in the digestive glands due to their bioaccumulation properties. The second aim was to explore the impacts of inorganic pollutants placed in environmental harbour's sites. After 21 days, the biomarker response of transplanted bivalves revealed a SOD decrease, Laccase and GST stimulations, higher concentrations in Cu, Fe, As, Co, Mn, Zn, Sn and no significant variation of MDA concentration. Our ecological relevance of biomarker approaches opens interesting perspectives to identify M. varia such as a pertinent marine sentinel species. The several selected biomarkers determined could confirm their ability to appraise the water quality of hydro-systems located in French coastlines, such as port areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Delineation of management zones in agricultural fields using cover crop biomass estimates from PlanetScope data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields, which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield. In this study, we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass (AGB) of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash-crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and/or vegetation indices (VIs). Therefore, we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops (forage turnip, white oats, and rye) in the season prior to cash-crop planting. Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models. They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope (PS) constellation of satellites. From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017, we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models. The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones. The cover-crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) and the lowest root mean square (RMSE) in the validation and test datasets were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cubist (CUB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB). For most models and cover crops, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the two most important AGB predictors. At the date of maximum VI at the beginning of the flowering stage, the correlation coefficients (r) between the cover-crop AGB and the cash-crop yield (soybean and maize) ranged from +0.70 for forage turnip to +0.78 for rye. The fuzzy unsupervised classification of the cover-crop AGB estimates delineated two management zones, which were spatially consistent with those obtained from cash-crop yield. The comparison between both maps produced overall accuracies that ranged from 61.20% to 68.25% with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB and cash-crop yield than zone 1 over the three sites. We conclude that satellite AGB estimates of cover crops can be used as a proxy for generating management zone maps in agricultural fields. These maps can be further refined in the field with any other type of method and data, whenever necessary.

TI  - Evolution and outcomes of sentinel lymph node mapping in vulvar cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo characterize our institutional experience with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with vulvar cancer. We describe the oncologic outcomes of these patients and the utilization of SLN detection techniques over time.MethodsA retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent inguinofemoral SLN biopsy as part of their treatment for vulvar cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2019. Patients were included in this analysis if they underwent inguinofemoral SLN biopsy for vulvar cancer, irrespective of presenting factors such as histology, tumor size or laterality. An "at-risk groin" was defined as either the right or left groin for which SLN biopsy of inguinofemoral lymph nodes was performed.ResultsA total of 160 patients were included in our analysis, representing 265 at-risk groins. 114 patients had squamous cell histology representing 195 at-risk groins. Of the 169 negative groins in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 year isolated groin recurrence rate was 1.2%. SLN detection rate, irrespective of modality, was 96.2%. Technetium-99 (TC-99) + blue dye detected SLNs in 91.8% of groins; TC-99 + indocyanine green detected SLNs in 100% of groins (p=0.157). Among the 110 groins that underwent mapping with TC-99 and blue dye, 4 patients had failed mapping with blue dye and mapped with TC-99 alone (3.6%). Among the 96 groins that underwent mapping with TC-99 and ICG, 14 patients failed to map with TC-99 and mapped with indocyanine green alone (14.6%).ConclusionsSLN mapping in vulvar cancer is reliable and oncologically effective. The utilization of indocyanine green for mapping has increased over the past decade and is associated with high rates of SLN detection.

TI  - Lessons learned implementing an operational continuous United States national land change monitoring capability: The Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing demands for temporally specific information on land surface change are fueling a new generation of maps and statistics that can contribute to understanding geographic and temporal patterns of change across large regions, provide input into a wide range of environmental modeling studies, clarify the drivers of change, and provide more timely information for land managers. To meet these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey has implemented a capability to monitor land surface change called the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative. This paper describes the methodological foundations and lessons learned during development and testing of the LCMAP approach. Testing and evaluation of a suite of 10 annual land cover and land surface change data sets over six diverse study areas across the United States revealed good agreement with other published maps (overall agreement ranged from 73% to 87%) as well as several challenges that needed to be addressed to meet the goals of robust, repeatable, and geographically consistent monitoring results from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. First, the high spatial and temporal variability of observational frequency led to differences in the number of changes identified, so CCDC was modified such that change detection is dependent on observational frequency. Second, the CCDC classification methodology was modified to improve its ability to characterize gradual land surface changes. Third, modifications were made to the classification element of CCDC to improve the representativeness of training data, which necessitated replacing the random forest algorithm with a boosted decision tree. Following these modifications, assessment of prototype Version 1 LCMAP results showed improvements in overall agreement (ranging from 85% to 90%).

AB  - Greenspace is increasingly examined as a low-cost way to increase standardized test scores in public schools. However, the evidence for this intervention is mixed. One potential explanation is the variety of ways that greenspace is measured using remotely sensed data. For instance, aggregate measures can be captured from tree, grass, and shrub cover classifications in high-resolution (1 m(2)) land cover datasets or they can be measured with normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) values from sensors at different resolutions (e.g., 30 m(2) or 250 m(2)). In the current cross-sectional observational study, we tested the relationship between five greenspace measures and third-grade math and reading standardized tests scores in Maryland public schools (n = 668) around schools and in children's neighborhoods. Low- and high-resolution greenspace measures were highly correlated with each other, but moderate-resolution measures were not. Multivariate regression models revealed positive associations between academic performance and low-resolution NDVI measures around schools and in neighborhoods as well as between performance and tree cover in neighborhoods. These effects were attenuated when an understudied confounder in this body of literature was included: population density as a measure of urbanicity. Grass cover showed associations with performance in models adjusted for urbanicity, but the direction of these associations was negative. These findings suggest that the possible association between greenspace and academic performance is complex and tenuous when examined with observational, cross-sectional study designs in limited geographic regions.

TI  - Transmission of and susceptibility to seasonal influenza in Switzerland from 2003 to 2015
T2  - EPIDEMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the seasonal patterns of influenza transmission is critical to help plan public health measures for the management and control of epidemics. Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission have been widely used to quantify the transmissibility of and susceptibility to past influenza seasons in many countries. The objective of this study was to obtain a detailed picture of the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in Switzerland from 2003 to 2015. To this end, we developed a compartmental influenza transmission model taking into account social mixing between different age groups and seasonal forcing. We applied a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model to the reported incidence of influenza-likeillness (ILI) and virological data from Sentinella, the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network. The maximal basic reproduction number, R-0, ranged from 1.46 to 1.81 (median). Median estimates of susceptibility to influenza ranged from 29% to 98% for different age groups, and typically decreased with age. We also found a decline in ascertainability of influenza cases with age. Our study illustrates how influenza surveillance data from Switzerland can be integrated into a Bayesian modeling framework in order to assess age-specific transmission of and susceptibility to influenza.

TI  - Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers-Collection 2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In May 2019, Collection 2 of the Copernicus Global Land Cover layers was released. Next to a global discrete land cover map at 100 m resolution, a set of cover fraction layers is provided depicting the percentual cover of the main land cover types in a pixel. This additional continuous classification scheme represents areas of heterogeneous land cover better than the standard discrete classification scheme. Overall, 20 layers are provided which allow customization of land cover maps to specific user needs or applications (e.g., forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and conservation, climate modeling, etc.). However, Collection 2 was not just a global up-scaling, but also includes major improvements in the map quality, reaching around 80% or more overall accuracy. The processing system went into operational status allowing annual updates on a global scale with an additional implemented training and validation data collection system. In this paper, we provide an overview of the major changes in the production of the land cover maps, that have led to this increased accuracy, including aligning with the Sentinel 2 satellite system in the grid and coordinate system, improving the metric extraction, adding better auxiliary data, improving the biome delineations, as well as enhancing the expert rules. An independent validation exercise confirmed the improved classification results. In addition to the methodological improvements, this paper also provides an overview of where the different resources can be found, including access channels to the product layer as well as the detailed peer-review product documentation.

TI  - Improved change monitoring using an ensemble of time series algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An ensemble of time series algorithms improves land change monitoring. The methodology combines the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC; Zhu & Woodcock, 2014) and Cumulative Sum of Residuals (CUSUM) algorithms for break detection and the Chow Test (Chow, 1960) for removing false positives (or breaks in time series not representing land change). The algorithms included are based on fundamentally different approaches to change detection and therefore offer unique advantages. The ensemble, or the combination of the three algorithms, was applied to 3 Landsat scenes in the United States and the results were assessed based on their ability to correctly discern structural breaks from stable time periods. The CUSUM test was shown to detect significant breaks 84.18% of the time and the Chow Test correctly removed breaks in 87.4% of the breaks analyzed. The ensemble produced results with lower frequency of errors of omission and commission (Type-I and Type-II errors) than a single algorithm approach. These results indicate that using a combination of break detection algorithms can be an improvement over typical approaches that utilize only one algorithm.

TI  - Monitoring tropical forest degradation using spectral unmixing and Landsat time series analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest loss currently contributes 5 to 15% of anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The large uncertainty in emissions estimates is a consequence of many factors, including differences in definitions of forests and degradation, as well as estimation methodologies. However, a primary factor driving uncertainty is an inability to properly account for forest degradation. While remote sensing offers the only practical way of monitoring forest disturbances over large areas, and despite recent improvements in data quality and quantity and processing techniques, remote sensing approaches are still limited in their ability to detect forest degradation. In this paper, a system is presented that uses time series of Landsat data and spectral mixture analysis to detect both degradation and deforestation in forested landscapes. The Landsat data are transformed into spectral endmember fractions and are used to calculate the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index (NDFI; Souza et al., 2005). The spectrally unmixed data are used for disturbance monitoring and land cover classification via time series analysis. To assess the performance of the system, maps of deforestation and degradation were used to stratify the study area for collection of sample data to which unbiased estimators were applied to produce accuracy and area estimates of degradation and deforestation from 1990 to 2013. The approach extends previous research in spectral mixture analysis for identifying forest degradation to the temporal domain. The method was applied using the Google Earth Engine and tested in the Brazilian State of Rondonia. Degradation and deforestation were mapped with 88.0% and 93.3% User's Accuracy, and 68.1% and 85.3% Producer's Accuracy. Area estimates of degradation and deforestation were produced with margins of error of 13.9% and 5.3%, respectively, over the 24 year time period. These results indicate that for Rondonia a decreasing trend in deforestation after 2004 corresponds to an increase in degradation during the same time period.

TI  - Seasonal Adaptation of the Thermal-Based Two-Source Energy Balance Model for Estimating Evapotranspiration in a Semiarid Tree-Grass Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model has accurately simulated energy fluxes in a wide range of landscapes with both remote and proximal sensing data. However, tree-grass ecosystems (TGE) have notably complex heterogeneous vegetation mixtures and dynamic phenological characteristics presenting clear challenges to earth observation and modeling methods. Particularly, the TSEB modeling structure assumes a single vegetation source, making it difficult to represent the multiple vegetation layers present in TGEs (i.e., trees and grasses) which have different phenological and structural characteristics. This study evaluates the implementation of TSEB in a TGE located in central Spain and proposes a new strategy to consider the spatial and temporal complexities observed. This was based on sensitivity analyses (SA) conducted on both primary remote sensing inputs (local SA) and model parameters (global SA). The model was subsequently modified considering phenological dynamics in semi-arid TGEs and assuming a dominant vegetation structure and cover (i.e., either grassland or broadleaved trees) for different seasons (TSEB-2S). The adaptation was compared against the default model and evaluated against eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements and lysimeters over the experimental site. TSEB-2S vastly improved over the default TSEB performance decreasing the mean bias and root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of latent heat (LE) from 40 and 82 W m(-2) to -4 and 59 W m(-2), respectively during 2015. TSEB-2S was further validated for two other EC towers and for different years (2015, 2016 and 2017) obtaining similar error statistics with RMSD of LE ranging between 57 and 63 W m(-2). The results presented here demonstrate a relatively simple strategy to improve water and energy flux monitoring over a complex and vulnerable landscape, which are often poorly represented through remote sensing models.

TI  - GEOSPATIAL DATA PROCESSING CHARACTERISTICS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING TASKS
T2  - ARCHITECTURE CIVIL ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the specifics of working with geospatial data when making decisions about the current environmental status of objects based on Earth space monitoring data. The expediency of sharing statistical data, Earth remote sensing data, and contact measurements is displayed. An analysis of the specifics of this approach to solving the problems of complex processing of multi-temporal a priori data obtained by various shooting equipment was carried out. The existing methods for combining such data are analyzed and possible options for reducing temporary resources and reducing requirements for information resources when working with large volumes of information are considered. It is appropriate to use the method of hierarchical partitioning of multi-temporal image data or images of the analyzed areas obtained at the same time, but from different satellites taking into account the specifics of the shooting equipment and subject to their correspondence to the given a priori geospatial information. One of the criteria for hierarchical partitioning is the identification of areas of greatest correspondence with a priori data with their geographical reference in satellite imagery to reduce the localization time of the corresponding zones throughout the analyzed image array. The economic application effect of this method is substantiated by reducing the computational complexity of costly pattern matching processes, as well as performance improvement of change determination algorithms in topological and geometric characteristics of these objects. An algorithm is shown for detecting changes in heterogeneity in images based on the result of overlay operations with time-differentiated satellite imagery. To confirm the adequacy of the proposed method, the results of its practical implementation are shown on the Ukraine-Poland border area. A comparative analysis of the obtained results with real data is carried out.

TI  - Technetium-99m-indocyanine green versus technetium-99m-methylene blue for sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe low accuracy of pre-operative imaging techniques for prediction of nodal status strengthens the relevance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial cancer, although the optimal method for its detection is still under investigation. The increasing use of indocyanine green (ICG) has aroused concern about its enhanced visualization of lymphatic channels, which could lead to a specimen that is thought to be nodal tissue not subsequently yielding a lymph node on pathologic analysis ('empty node packet'). Our main objective was to compare the overall and bilateral detection rates for SLN biopsy using two combined techniques: technetium-99m-ICG (Tc-99m-ICG) versus technetium-99m-methylene blue (Tc-99m-MB). Our secondary aim was to compare the 'empty node packet' rates between the two cohorts.MethodsA prospective, non-randomized, single-center trial including patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer (any grade or histology) in pre-operative early stage, and operated on between February 2017 and July 2019. All tracers were injected intracervically. Pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy were performed on patients at intermediate or high risk of recurrence pre-operatively. All SLNs were sent for intra-operative frozen section and afterwards processed following an ultrastaging protocol.ResultsEighty-four patients were included, 58% (n=49) in the Tc-99m-MB group and 42% (n=35) in the Tc-99m-ICG group. Overall detection rate was 93% and was not statistically different between the two groups. A better bilateral detection rate was observed among Tc-99m-ICG patients (69% vs 41%, p=0.012). The 'empty node packet' rate was 4% in the Tc-99m-ICG cohort and 0% in the Tc-99m-MB cohort (p=0.032).DiscussionTc-99m-ICG is a feasible, safe technique for SLN biopsy in early-stage endometrial cancer, and appears to be superior in terms of bilateral detection to Tc-99m-MB. The addition of Tc-99m to ICG could decrease the rate of 'empty node packets' and better define the anatomic location of SLNs in patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Exposure to <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in zoo animals in Spain
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A serosurvey was performed to assess exposure to Toxoplasma gondii in zoo animals in Spain and to determine the dynamics of seropositivity in some zoo species over time. Sera from 393 zoo animals belonging to 91 species were collected in eight zoos in Spain between 2007 and 2019. Additionally, 39 of the 393 animals from five of the analyzed zoos were longitudinally sampled during the same study period. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 165 (42.0 %; CI95 %: 37.1-46.9) of 393 animals by the modified agglutination test (MAT, cut-off = 25). Antibody titers of 25, 50, 100 and >= 500 were found in 25 (15.2 %), 65 (39.4 %), 26 (15.8 %), and 49 (29.7 %) of the seropositive animals, respectively. Feeding habits (carnivorous species) was a risk factor (OR = 5.6; P < 0.001; CI95 %: 3.8-9.0) potentially associated with T. gondii exposure. Eighteen (46.2 %) of the 39 animals longitudinally sampled were always seropositive and five animals (12.8 %) (two spotted hyaena [Crocuta crocuta], one blesbok [Damaliscus pygargus], one white rhinoceros [Ceratotherium simum] and one mouflon [Ovis aries musimon]) seroconverted during the study period. Our results evince a wide circulation of T. gondii in zoos in Spain, including wild felids. Zoo animals can be useful sentinel species to monitor T. gondii circulation in epidemiological scenarios with a close human-wildlife interface. Control measures should be implemented in zoo parks to minimize the risk of exposure of zoo species to T. gondii.

TI  - Identifying the Contributions of Multi-Source Data for Winter Wheat Yield Prediction in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is a leading cereal grain throughout the world. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction at a large scale is essential for the agricultural supply chain and global food security, especially in China as an important wheat producing and consuming country. The conventional approach using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical and crop models has prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, socio-economic (SC) factors may also improve crop yield prediction, but their contributions need in-depth investigation, especially in regions with good irrigation conditions, sufficient fertilization, and pesticide application. Here, we performed the first attempt to predict wheat yield across China from 2001 to 2015 at the county-level by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., Vegetation indices (VIs)), and SC factors. The results show that incorporating all the datasets by using three machine learning methods (Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)) can achieve the best performance in yield prediction (R-2: 0.68 similar to 0.75), with the most individual contributions from climate (similar to 0.53), followed by VIs (similar to 0.45), and SC factors (similar to 0.30). In addition, the combinations of VIs and climate data can capture inter-annual yield variability more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of climate and SC, and combinations of VIs and SC), while combining SC with climate data can better capture spatial yield variability than others. Climate data can provide extra and unique information across the entire growing season, while the peak stage of VIs (Mar.similar to Apr.) do so. Furthermore, incorporating spatial information and soil proprieties into the benchmark models can improve wheat yield prediction by 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. The optimal wheat prediction can be achieved with approximately a two-month leading time before maturity. Our study develops timely and robust methods for winter wheat yield prediction at a large scale in China, which can be applied to other crops and regions.

TI  - The November 2019 Seismic Sequence in Albania: Geodetic Constraints and Fault Interaction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The seismic sequence of November 2019 in Albania culminating with the Mw = 6.4 event of 26 November 2019 was examined from the geodetic (InSAR and GNSS), structural, and historical viewpoints, with some ideas on possible areas of greater hazard. We present accurate estimates of the coseismic displacements using permanent GNSS stations active before and after the sequence, as well as SAR interferograms with Sentinel-1 in ascending and descending mode. When compared with the displacements predicted by a dislocation model on an elastic half space using the moment tensor information of a reverse fault mechanism, the InSAR and GNSS data fit at the mm level provided the hypocentral depth is set to 8 +/- 2 km. Next, we examined the elastic stress generated by the Mw = 7.2 Montenegro earthquake of 1979, with the Albania 2019 event as receiver fault, to conclude that the Coulomb stress transfer, at least for the elastic component, was too small to have influenced the 2019 Albania event. A somewhat different picture emerges from the combined elastic deformation resulting after the two (1979 and 2019) events: we investigated the fault geometries where the Coulomb stress is maximized and concluded that the geometry with highest induced Coulomb stress, of the order of ca. 2-3 bar (0.2-0.3 MPa), is that of a vertical, dextral strike slip fault, striking SW to NE. This optimal receiver fault is located between the faults activated in 1979 and 2019, and very closely resembles the Lezhe fault, which marks the transition between the Dinarides and the Albanides.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Optical and thermal remote sensing data have been an important tool in geological exploration for certain deposit types. However, the present economic and technological advances demand the adaptation of the remote sensing data and image processing techniques to the exploration of other raw materials like lithium (Li). A bibliometric analysis, using a systematic review approach, was made to understand the recent interest in the application of remote sensing methods in Li exploration. A review of the application studies and developments in this field was also made. Throughout the paper, the addressed topics include: (i) achievements made in Li exploration using remote sensing methods; (ii) the main weaknesses of the approaches; (iii) how to overcome these difficulties; and (iv) the expected research perspectives. We expect that the number of studies concerning this topic will increase in the near future and that remote sensing will become an integrated and fundamental tool in Li exploration.

TI  - Maker Buoy Variants for Water Level Monitoring and Tracking Drifting Objects in Remote Areas of Greenland
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meltwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet changes water levels in glacial lakes and can lead to glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) events that threaten lives and property. Icebergs produced at Greenland's marine terminating glaciers drift into Baffin Bay and the North Atlantic, where they can threaten shipping and offshore installations. Thus, monitoring glacial lake water levels and the drift of icebergs can enhance safety and aid in the scientific studies of glacial hydrology and iceberg-ocean interactions. The Maker Buoy was originally designed as a low-cost and open source sensor to monitor surface ocean currents. The open source framework, low-cost components, rugged construction and affordable satellite data transmission capabilities make it easy to customize for environmental monitoring in remote areas and under harsh conditions. Here, we present two such Maker Buoy variants that were developed to monitor water level in an ice-infested glacial lake in southern Greenland and to track drifting icebergs and moorings in the Vaigat Strait (Northwest Greenland). We describe the construction of each design variant, methods to access data in the field without an internet connection, and deployments in Greenland in summer 2019. The successful deployments of each Maker Buoy variant suggest that they may also be useful in operational iceberg management strategies and in GLOF monitoring programs.

TI  - Artificial urinary sphincter: current status and future directions
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) is one of the most troublesome complications of surgery of the prostate whether for malignancy or benign conditions. For many decades, there have been attempts to reduce the morbidity of this outcome with variable results. Since its development in the 1970s, the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) has been the "gold standard" for treatment of the most severe cases of UUI. Other attempts including injectable bulking agents, previous sphincter designs, and slings have been developed, but largely abandoned because of poor long-term efficacy and significant complications. The AUS has had several sentinel redesigns since its first introduction to reduce erosion and infection and increase efficacy. None of these changes in the basic AUS design have occurred in the past three decades, and the AUS remains the same despite newer technology and materials that could improve its function and safety. Recently, newer compressive devices and slings to reposition the bladder neck for men with mild-to-moderate UUI have been developed with success in select patients. Similarly, the AUS has had applied antibiotic coating to all portions except the pressure-regulating balloon (PRB) to reduce infection risk. The basic AUS design, however, has not changed. With newer electronic technology, the concept of the electronic AUS or eAUS has been proposed and several possible iterations of this eAUS have been reported. While the eAUS is as yet not available, its development continues and a prototype device may be available soon. Possible design options are discussed in this review.

TI  - Mapping and Damage Assessment of "Royal" Burial Mounds in the Siberian Valley of the Kings
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Valley of the Kings in Tuva Republic, southern Siberia, is arguably one of the most important archaeological landscapes in the eastern Eurasian steppes. Nonetheless, little information exists about the spatial characteristics and preservation conditions of this burial ground consisting of large "royal" mounds. We map the large monuments of the Uyuk Valley's northern river terrace and assess their state of preservation based on high-resolution optical satellite data. The burial site consists of several hundred mounds, over 150 of them with diameters of more than 25 m, the largest monuments are bigger than 100 m in diameter. This makes the Valley of the Kings in Tuva Republic one of the largest Early Iron Age burial sites in the Eurasian steppes. Unfortunately, around 92% of the large monuments are in bad condition, mostly due to looting.

TI  - Foundation doctor knowledge of wounds and dressings is improved by a simple intervention: An audit cycle-based quality improvement study
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Many foundation year 1 and 2 doctors (FYs) have limited knowledge experience in wound management. Wound dressing formularies exist in many NHS Trusts, though awareness of and adherence to them by FYs is not known. This quality improvement study described baseline FY knowledge of wound management, and investigated whether this could be improved through educational intervention.Methods: A single-centre, prospective, baseline audit was conducted following local approval. This assessed knowledge of wound types and appropriate dressings alongside individual confidence providing wound care. The educational intervention involved the distribution of an ID-badge sized quick reference guide that could be attached to the FYs' lanyards, and an introduction to the formulary during routine teaching. The audit loop was closed by repeating the questionnaire.Results: Pre- (n = 43) and post- (n = 35) intervention questions were completed by FYs. The mean score post-intervention was significantly higher than the pre-intervention score across all knowledge questions (from 32% correct to 71% correct, p < 0.0001). There was no change in participant confidence, which remained low.Conclusion: FYs lack confidence and knowledge about wounds and dressings. The latter can be improved through a simple and practical educational intervention that could be deployed nationally.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Patterns of Land Use/Land Cover Change in the Bhutan-Bengal Foothill Region Between 1987 and 2019: Study Towards Geospatial Applications and Policy Making
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of land use and land cover (LULC) change is fundamental aspect of the landscape dynamics or environmental health evaluation at different spatio-temporal scales. Assessment of LULC change is highly imperative in evaluating the environmental and ecosystem management, conservation, land use planning, resource management and overall sustainable environmental management. The rich natural biodiversity zone of Bhutan-Bengal foothill has been considered to assess the LULC change from 1987 to 2019. The principal objective of this study is to identify the rate of transformation of land use and land cover change along with its causes and consequences. ETM, ETM+ and OLI Landsat satellite images of 1987, 2001 and 2019 are used to find out the magnitude of land use and land cover transformation. Maximum likelihood classifier or maximum likelihood classification method has been applied to classify the attributes of LULC change of Bhutan-Bengal foothill. The LULC components are further verified and rectified by reliable statistical error (confused) matrix accuracy assessment techniques to sort out the error incurred during preparation of final spatio-temporal LULC change maps. The result shows that there is a partial change of LULC during the last 3 decades (1987-2019). LULC data of 3 decades reveal a negative change or reduction of areas like vegetation (-2.93%), agriculture (-6.955) and plantation (-0.5%), whereas other three important LULC components such as built-up area (6.44%), barren land (2.71%) and water body (1.29%) take slightly positive trend. Large-scale human encroachment, natural forest habitat fragmentation and conversion have brought rapid transformation from natural landscape to cultural landscape in Bhutan-Bengal foothill. This fundamental research will definitely help to make policy framing holistic management approach.

TI  - Primary Cutaneous Umbilical Melanoma: The Michigan Experience
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Primary cutaneous umbilical melanoma is rare. Thorough information regarding its characteristics and treatment, including use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) staging, is difficult to obtain. The unique anatomy of the umbilicus adds to the complexity of diagnosing and treating melanoma at this site. OBJECTIVE To improve understanding of diagnosis and treatment of primary cutaneous umbilical melanoma through presenting 7 new cases and reviewing 39 cases in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS The University of Michigan melanoma database query and review of the literature regarding reported cases of primary umbilical melanoma. RESULTS In 7 new and 39 previously reported cases of primary cutaneous umbilical melanoma, we describe signs and symptoms, histopathologic features, differential diagnosis, relevant anatomical considerations, and definitive treatment including SLNB when applicable. CONCLUSION Our series, combined with a thorough literature review and compilation of findings, provides a better understanding and appreciation of melanoma in the unique anatomical site of the umbilicus, with a reminder to carefully examine the umbilicus during a full skin examination in patients at risk of melanoma. Primary umbilical melanoma presents and can be appropriately treated similarly to cutaneous melanoma in other sites, with attention to relevant anatomy.

TI  - CMIR-NET : A deep learning based model for cross-modal retrieval in remote sensing
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We address the problem of cross-modal information retrieval in the domain of remote sensing. In particular, we are interested in two application scenarios: i) cross-modal retrieval between panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral imagery, and ii) multi-label image retrieval between very high resolution (VHR) images and speech-based label annotations. These multi-modal retrieval scenarios are more challenging than the traditional uni-modal retrieval approaches given the inherent differences in distributions between the modalities. However, with the increasing availability of multi-source remote sensing data and the scarcity of enough semantic annotations, the task of multi-modal retrieval has recently become extremely important. In this regard, we propose a novel deep neural network-based architecture that is considered to learn a discriminative shared feature space for all the input modalities, suitable for semantically coherent information retrieval. Extensive experiments are carried out on the benchmark large-scale PAN - multispectral DSRSID dataset and the multi-label UC-Merced dataset. Together with the Merced dataset, we generate a corpus of speech signals corresponding to the labels. Superior performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art is observed in all the cases.

TI  - QUANTIFICATION OF LAND USE CHANGES IN COMPLEX CROPPING OF IRRIGATED INDUS BASIN, PAKISTAN USING MODIS VEGETATION TIME SERIES DATA
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of change in area under different crops is vital for conducting macro scale hydrological studies as spatial crop water use depends on type of crops grown. This becomes more challenging in areas with complex cropping systems like irrigated Indus basin of Pakistan. In this study, estimation of cropped area was carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation time series at six-hectare spatial resolution i.e. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAW). Two cropping years i.e. 2002-03 and 2013-14 were selected to quantify cropped area as well as assess how the cropping systems had changed over a time span of eleven years. Each pixel was trained to assign the vegetation, a particular crop cluster. Four and five major crops were discerned for rabi (winter) and kharif (summer) seasons, respectively. Wheat is dominant rabi crop while rice (a high delta crop) and cotton are dominant kharif crops. Sugarcane is an annual crop and being grown in different tracts of the basin. A confusion matrix prepared for accuracy test shows an overall accuracy of 79% and 74% for rabi and kharif seasons, respectively. The Kappa coefficient (0.64 and 0.62) expresses moderate agreement between satellite-derived map and on ground situation. Change detection indicates that wheat area has been increased significantly 4.2 mha (38.3%) from 2002 to 2013. Rice and sugarcane have also shown a significant increase of 0.69 mha (26.3%) and 0.29 mha (21.8%), respectively during the time span of eleven years. However, it is highly cautious for water management planners due to higher delta of these crops. This study provides essential information for spatial distribution of major seasonal crops grown in water stressed irrigated Indus basin for efficient agricultural monitoring and water resources management.

TI  - Decolonizing Japan-South Korea Relations: Hegemony, the Cold War, and the Subaltern State
T2  - ASIAN PERSPECTIVE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a postcolonial approach to focus on the relations between the dominator/colonizer and the subordinated/colonized to reveal how the imperial legacy continues to influence the current relations between Japan and South Korea. The sources of current tensions between Japan and South Korea are threefold: First, the continuity of Japan's worldview inherited from the imperial era still influences Japan's interpretation of historical disputes with its former colonies. Second, decolonization has not been achieved between Japan and South Korea due to the Cold War and pressure from the United States to shelve historical disputes amid the normalizing of relations between Japan and South Korea. Third, as a subaltern state, South Korea was caught between pursuing complete independence and autonomy and collaboration with its past colonizer in the state-building process. This approach sheds new light on the multiplicity of the disputes between the two countries and explains why negative colonial legacies still haunt Japan and its relations with South Korea.

TI  - Central Taiwan's hydroclimate in response to land use/cover change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) has taken place since the 1990s in central Taiwan; however, its impacts on the local and regional hydroclimatology are not understood thoroughly. This study is grounded in a numerical experiment using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and statistical assessments of continuous land cover and gridded precipitation data derived for central Taiwan. We incorporate survey-based land use data in 1995 and 2007 in driving WRF to simulate selective non-rainy and rainy (dry and wet) cases under weak synoptic forcings in July and August (JA). The two land-use conditions reveal changes in simulation fields on account of increased urban and built-up lands. Results averaged over the dry cases show increased (diminished) sensible heat fluxes and 2 m temperatures (latent heat fluxes and 2 m specific humidity) in 2007 compared to that in 1995. The wet-case simulation further identifies intensified precipitation over the downwind areas of urban and built-up lands, strongly subject to local topography and prevailing winds. Statistical assessments of the Landsat land cover and gridded precipitation data verify significant increasing trends in urbanization and the JA rainfall. Regression-based analysis that scales the effect of the LUCC on the change in precipitation corroborates the WRF simulation: LUCC has induced eastward, downwind association with the JA rainfall.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Prediction of Stand Volume by a Hybrid Model of Support Vector Machine for Regression Kriging
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying stand volume through open-access satellite remote sensing data supports proper management of forest stand. Because of limitations on single sensor and support vector machine for regression (SVR) as well as benefits from hybrid models, this study innovatively builds a hybrid model as support vector machine for regression kriging (SVRK) to map stand volume of the Changbai Mountains mixed forests covering 171,450 ha area based on a small training dataset (n = 928). This SVRK model integrated SVR and its residuals interpolated by ordinary kriging. To determine the importance of multi-sensor predictors from ALOS and Sentinel series, the increase in root mean square error (RMSE) of SVR was calculated by removing the variable after the standardization. The SVRK model achieved accuracy with mean error, RMSE and correlation coefficient in -2.67%, 25.30% and 0.76, respectively, based on an independent dataset (n = 464). The SVRK improved the accuracy of 9% than SVR based on RMSE values. Topographic indices from L band InSAR, backscatters of L band SAR, and texture features of VV channel from C band SAR, as well as vegetation indices of the optical sensor were contributive to explain spatial variations of stand volume. This study concluded that SVRK was a promising approach for mapping stand volume in the heterogeneous temperate forests with limited samples.

TI  - Pre-Event Deformation and Failure Mechanism Analysis of the Pusa Landslide, China with Multi-Sensor SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pusa landslide, in Guizhou, China, occurred on 28 August 2017, caused 26 deaths with 9 missing. However, few studies about the pre-event surface deformation are provided because of the complex landslide formation and failure mechanism. To retrieve the precursory signal of this landslide, we recovered pre-event deformation with multi-sensor synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. First, we delineated the boundary and source area of the Pusa landslide based on the coherence and SAR intensity maps. Second, we detected the line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rate and time series before the Pusa landslide with ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1A/B SAR imagery data, where we found that the onset of the deformation is four months before landslide event. Finally, we conceptualized the failure mechanism of the Pusa landslide as the joint effects of rainfall and mining activity. This research provides new insights into the failure mechanism and early warning of rock avalanches.

TI  - Remote sensing of urban thermal environments within local climate zones: A case study of two high-density subtropical Chinese cities
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of urban thermal environments is vital for improving urban planning and design strategies to mitigate the urban heat island effect as part of sustainable development. This study investigates the fine-scale thermal environment within high density cities using multi-sourced open satellite data. The whole urban area was first classified based on the urban features such as building morphology and land cover, using the local climate zone scheme; then the thermal performance of different local climate zones was assessed using thermal satellite data. Experiments conducted in two high-density Chinese cities indicated that different urban structures have contrasting thermal conditions in the daytime and nighttime. Furthermore, the utility of different satellite data for detecting and monitoring intra-urban thermal environments was assessed. It was found that Landsat and ASTER satellite data have similar performance, and both datasets perform better than MODIS data, which tend to underestimate urban heat islands. The findings of this study can provide a fast and efficient way to understand the thermal environment within high-density cities, which will allow for better planning to improve urban thermal conditions and ensure more sustainable development.

TI  - Observed earlier start of the growing season from middle to high latitudes across the Northern Hemisphere snow-covered landmass for the period 2001-2014
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology in spring has received much attention for its importance to terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere interactions studies. Through control on surface water and heat balance, snow cover largely impacts on spring vegetation phenology. However, under the background of global warming and rapid reduction of spring snow cover extent across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the responses of spring vegetation phenology have not been well documented. Using two satellite-derived land cover dynamic datasets and 420 in situ vegetation phenology observations from five filed datasets, this study evaluated the accuracy of satellite-derived vegetation phenology datasets and explored the changes of start of the growing season (SOS) across the NH snow-covered landmass for the period 2001-2014. Compared with MEaSUREs VIPPHEN, the MODIS SOS maps displayed higher accuracy in capture the real SOS climatology by validating with in situ observations (R-2 = 0.67, bias = -3.99 d). Moreover, evidences from MODIS SOS maps pointed out that the SOS advanced by approximately 2.36 d in NH middle to high latitudes (43.5 degrees N-70.0 degrees N), but delayed by about 0.53 d in lower latitudes (33.0 degrees N-43.5 degrees N) from 2001 to 2014. The contrast SOS anomalies across the NH snow-covered landmass were further proved by changes in spring NDVI derived from GIMMS in the corresponding period. In addition, the observed changes in SOS were consistent with the spatiotemporal pattern of spring snow end date found in previous studies, indicating vegetation phenology changes should be taken into account in estimating the impacts of snow in climate-biosphere interactions studies.

TI  - Estimation of Winter Wheat Leaf Water Content Based on Leaf and Canopy Hyperspectral Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and nondestructive monitoring of leaf water content (LWC) is critical to crop drought diagnosis and irrigation decision. In order to quantify and predict the LWC with hyperspectral remote sensing data, field experiments of winter wheat with different water-deficit stress levels were conducted for two consecutive years (2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Hyperspectral reflectance was recorded at four growth stages. Then, normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI) were calculated in all possible combinations within 350-2500 nm, and their correlations with LWC were quantified to identify the best indices. Spectral data were also used to build partial least squares regression (PLSR) and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling- partial least squares regression (CARS-PLSR) model to calculate LWC. Two different data forms (original and first derivative reflectance) and two different observation scales (leaf and canopy) were used to explore the suitability of these three algorithms on estimating LWC for winter wheat. Additionally, in order to avoid sampling uncertainty when constructing calibration and validation datasets, a method of increasing the number of sampling times was proposed to improve the robustness of prediction models. The results showed that the best spectral indices for estimating LWC of winter wheat were NDSI (R-1162, R-1321) and RSI(R-1162, R-1 321) with R-2 of 0. 871 and 0. 872 respectively, which were both based on original leaf reflectance. RSI models had higher estimation accuracy than NDSI models under the same situation. The PLSR model based on original leaf reflectance obtained the best performance for predicting LWC with R(2 )of 0. 953. CARS-PLSR based on the first derivative leaf reflectance was the most accurate model (R-2 = 0. 969; RMSE=0. 164; RRMSE=6%). It was indicated that in terms of different forms of hyperspectral data, the original spectral-based models were better than the first derivative spectral-based models in two-band vegetation index and PLSR models, but the results were reversed for the CARS-PLSR model. While for different observation scales, LWC had stronger correlations with leaf reflectance-based models than that of the canopy based models. Overall, CARS-PLSR delivered better performance than the other two methods. In light of this, CARS was a feasible band selection algorithm and the prediction accuracy of CARS-PLSR model for LWC estimation of winter wheat was better than that of the other two models. CARS-PLSR method provides a promising approach for accurate and rapid monitoring of winter wheat drought.

TI  - GRACE satellite monitoring and driving factors analysis of groundwater storage under high-intensity coal mining conditions: a case study of Ordos, northern Shaanxi and Shanxi, China
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining in northwestern China is an important industry. For the traditional monitoring of water resources in coal-rich regions, a single monitoring well or remote-sensing image is often used to obtain the groundwater level or water body area. The process is restricted by the spatial distribution of monitoring wells and the quality of remote sensing images. The regions of Ordos, Northern Shaanxi (including Yan'an and Yulin cities), herein collectively referred to as OYY, and Shanxi (SX) were studied. Here, groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA) were derived using the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite data and WaterGAP global hydrology model, and the change trend of groundwater storage (GWS) was explored. Using time series analysis and grey slope relational analysis, the potential driving factors of regional GWSA were derived and considered independent variables. In combination with GWSA, the quantitative relationship between the variables was established by partial least squares regression. Results showed that: (1) the decreasing rate of GWS in OYY and SX reached -0.65 and -1.16 cm/year, respectively, from 2003 to 2014; (2) the main driving factors leading to the reduction of GWS included coal-mining water consumption for OYY and water consumption by coal mining and agricultural irrigation for SX, and the weights of water consumption by coal mining and agricultural irrigation for SX were both 50%. Therefore, GRACE satellite data show good application in groundwater monitoring of coal-mining concentrated areas, providing an important basis for the formulation of water resource management measures.

TI  - Evaluation of sea salt aerosols in climate systems: global climate modeling and observation-based analyses*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea salt aerosols (SSA), one of the most abundant aerosol species over the global oceans, play important roles for Earth's climate. State-of-the-art SSA parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) are typically modeled using near-surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), and precipitation. However, these have non-trivial biases in CMIP3 and CMIP5 GCMs over the tropical Pacific Ocean that can contribute to biases in the simulated SSA. This study investigates the impacts of falling ice radiative effects on the biases of the aforementioned modeled parameters and the resulting modeled SSA biases. We compare the CMIP5 modeled SSA against satellite observations from MISR and MODIS using a pair of sensitivity experiments with falling ice radiative effects on and off in the CESM1-CAM5 model. The results show that when falling ice radiative effects are not taken into account, models have weaker surface wind speeds, warmer SSTs, excessive precipitation, and diluted sea surface salinity (SSS) over the Pacific trade-wind regions, leading to underestimated SSA. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the inclusion of falling ice radiative effects leads to improvements in the modeled near-surface wind speeds, SSTs, and precipitation through cloud-precipitation-radiation-circulation coupling, which results in more representative patterns of SSA and reduces the SSA biases by similar to 10% to 15% relative to the satellite observations. Models including falling ice radiative effects in CMIP5 produce smaller biases in SSA than those without falling ice radiative effects. We suggest that one of the causes of these biases is likely the failure to account for falling ice radiative effects, and these biases in turn affect the direct and indirect effects of SSA in the GCMs.

TI  - Big Earth Observation Data Integration in Remote Sensing Based on a Distributed Spatial Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The arrival of the era of big data for Earth observation (EO) indicates that traditional data management models have been unable to meet the needs of remote sensing data in big data environments. With the launch of the first remote sensing satellite, the volume of remote sensing data has also been increasing, and traditional data storage methods have been unable to ensure the efficient management of large amounts of remote sensing data. Therefore, a professional remote sensing big data integration method is sorely needed. In recent years, the emergence of some new technical methods has provided effective solutions for multi-source remote sensing data integration. This paper proposes a multi-source remote sensing data integration framework based on a distributed management model. In this framework, the multi-source remote sensing data are partitioned by the proposed spatial segmentation indexing (SSI) model through spatial grid segmentation. The designed complete information description system, based on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 19115, can explain multi-source remote sensing data in detail. Then, the distributed storage method of data based on MongoDB is used to store multi-source remote sensing data. The distributed storage method is physically based on the sharding mechanism of the MongoDB database, and it can provide advantages for the security and performance of the preservation of remote sensing data. Finally, several experiments have been designed to test the performance of this framework in integrating multi-source remote sensing data. The results show that the storage and retrieval performance of the distributed remote sensing data integration framework proposed in this paper is superior. At the same time, the grid level of the SSI model proposed in this paper also has an important impact on the storage efficiency of remote sensing data. Therefore, the remote storage data integration framework, based on distributed storage, can provide new technical support and development prospects for big EO data.

TI  - Elucidating space based observations of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence over terrestrial vegetation of India
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed plant fluorescence signals have the potential to facilitate a better understanding of vegetation photosynthetic dynamics. Space based observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides an alternative non-invasive approach to investigate gross primary production (GPP), a key element of ecological research. Orbiting carbon observatory (OCO-2) is providing continuous global measurements of SIF at 757 nm and 771 nm wavelengths with nadir and glint mode observations. Using one of the three spectrometer instruments, measurements of SIF complements OCO-2's Carbon dioxide data with information on when and where plants are drawing carbon from the atmosphere. Here, we present spatio-temporal patterns of space borne observations of SIF and its correlation with GPP and vegetation indices over diverse terrestrial vegetation of India. The results indicate a spatial variability in SIF ranging from 0.001 to 0.6 (+/- 0.16) Wm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) and 0.001 to 0.7 (+/- 0.2) Wm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) in nadir and glint modes, respectively. OCO-2 derived SIF at finer scale shows a similar trend with MODIS derived GPP during September-October-November and June-July-August seasons. A linear correlation of satellite derived SIF with GPP (Pearson's coefficient, r = 0.84), EVI (r = 0.72) and NDVI (r = 0.63) at 757 nm for 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees grid over terrestrial India is reported, besides seasonal variations. Amongst the diverse vegetation types, SIF and GPP are well correlated over Evergreen broadleaf forests. The study provides new insights and useful inputs to GPP modelling and improved understanding of terrestrial carbon cycle research in India.

TI  - Application of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to forecast rodent population abundance in smallholder agro-ecosystems in semi-arid areas in Tanzania
T2  - MAMMALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite-derived remote sensing data for monitoring rodent abundance in semi-arid areas of Tanzania. We hypothesized that NDVI could potentially complement rainfall in predicting rodent abundance spatially and temporally. NDVI were determined across habitats with different vegetation types in Isimani landscape, Iringa Region, in the southern highlands of Tanzania. Normalized differences in reflectance between the red (R) (0.636-0.673 mm) and near-infrared (NIR) (0.851-0.879 mm) channels of the electromagnetic spectrum from the Landsat 8 [Operational Land Imager (OLI)] sensor were obtained. Rodents were trapped in a total of 144 randomly selected grids each measuring 100 x 100 m(2), for which the corresponding values of NDVI were recorded during the corresponding rodent trapping period. Raster analysis was performed by transformation to establish NDVI in study grids over the entire study area. The relationship between NDVI, rodent distribution and abundance both spatially and temporally during the start, mid and end of the dry and wet seasons was established. Linear regression model was used to evaluate the relationships between NDVI and rodent abundance across seasons. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) at p <= 0.05 was carried out to describe the degree of association between actual and NDVI-predicted rodent abundances. The results demonstrated a strong linear relationship between NDVI and actual rodent abundance within grids (R 2 =0.71). NDVI-predicted rodent abundance showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.99) with estimated rodent abundance. These results support the hypothesis that NDVI has the potential for predicting rodent population abundance under smallholder farming agro-ecosystems. Hence, NDVI could be used to forecast rodent abundance within a reasonable short period of time when compared with sparse and not widely available rainfall data.

TI  - Estimation of leaf photosynthetic capacity from the photochemical reflectance index and leaf pigments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content has recently been found to be a better proxy than leaf nitrogen content for leaf photosynthetic capacity in a mixed deciduous broadleaf forest. A key concept underlying the relationship between leaf photosynthetic capacity and leaf chlorophyll content was the coordinate regulation of photosynthetic components (i.e. light harvesting, photochemical, and biochemical components). In order to test this hypothesis, we measured seasonal variations in leaf nitrogen content (N-leaf), leaf photosynthetic pigments (i.e. chlorophyll (Chkl(Leaf), carotenoids (Car(Leaf)) and xanthophyll (Xan(Leaf))) and leaf photosynthetic capacity (i.e. the maximum rate at which ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) is carboxylated (V-cmax25) and regenerated (J(max25)) at 25 degrees C) at a paddy rice site during the growing season in 2016. We investigated the effectiveness of (N-leaf), leaf photosynthetic pigments, leaf-level photochemical reflectance index at sunny noon (PRILeaf-noon) and their possible combinations for estimating leaf photosynthetic capacities (i.e. V-cmax25 and J(max25)) at a paddy rice site. Chl(Leaf) was highly correlated to V-cmax25 and J(max25) (R-2 = 0.89 and 0.87, respectively), which were better than N-leaf (R-2 = 0.80 and 0.85, respectively). The products of PRI(Leaf-noon )with leaf pigments (i.e. Chl(Leaf), Car(Leaf )and Xan(Leaf)) were also found to be highly correlated with V-cmax25 (R-2 = 0.95-0.96). Also, the product of leaf chlorophyll a and Car(Leaf )was a good proxy for V-cmax25 (R-2 = 0.93). In sum, this study supported the previously findings that leaf chlorophyll content was better correlated with V-cmax25 than leaf nitrogen content. Also, combining PRILeaf-(noon) with leaf pigments (i.e. Chl(Leaf), Car(Leaf) and Xan(Leaf)) offered an additional way to estimate leaf photosynthetic capacity (i.e. V-cmax25). These findings supported the hypothesis of coordinate regulation of photosynthetic components and they would be helpful to estimation of leaf photosynthetic capacity using remote sensing data.

TI  - Current Role of Intraoperative Frozen Section Examination of Sentinel Lymph Node in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the current role of frozen section in identifying patients who could benefit from an immediate axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), following the criteria of the ASOCOG Z0011 and IBCSG 23-10 trials. Patients and Methods: A retrospective review was performed involving 2,079 patients with early breast cancer who underwent conservative surgery or total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Results: Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were 63.8% and 90.3%, respectively. Sensitivity was significantly higher (p<0.001) in finding macrometastases (81.8%) compared to micrometastases (11.9%). Frozen section was useful only in 7.7% of the patients who met the criteria of the IBCSG 23-01 and ACOSOG Z0011 trials. Conclusion: Frozen section continues to be very useful in the intraoperative assessment of the SLN, offering a high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. Omission of ALND in 24.4% of patients who met the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria would have resulted in their undertreatment.

TI  - Axillary Nodal Burden in Breast Cancer Patients With Pre-operative Fine Needle Aspiration-proven Positive Lymph Nodes Compared to Those With Positive Sentinel Nodes
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Recent years have seen a considerable shift to a more conservative management of the axilla in patients with positive axillary sentinel lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to determine whether some breast cancer patients with a preoperative ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy proven positive node could potentially be spared an axillary lymph node dissection according to the ACOSOG Z0011 trial criteria. Patients and Methods: A retrospective review was performed involving 623 breast cancer patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection after either ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy proven positive node or sentinel lymph node biopsy. Results: Patients with fine needle aspiration biopsy-proven positive node had worse prognosis and a higher nodal burden (6.7 vs 1.9 nodes, p<0.001), compared to those with positive sentinel lymph nodes. Conclusion: Patients with an ultrasound guided needle aspiration biopsy proven positive node are more likely to have tumor with more aggressive pathological characteristics and a higher nodal burden than those with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - The Climate Monitoring SAF Outgoing Longwave Radiation from AVHRR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) have been used to create several long-duration data records of geophysical variables describing the atmosphere and land and water surfaces. In the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) project, AVHRR data are used to derive the Cloud, Albedo, and Radiation (CLARA) climate data records of radiation components (i.a., surface albedo) and cloud properties (i.a., cloud cover). This work describes the methodology implemented for the additional estimation of the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), an important Earth radiation budget component, that is consistent with the other CLARA variables. A first step is the estimation of the instantaneous OLR from the AVHRR observations. This is done by regressions on a large database of collocated observations between AVHRR Channel 4 (10.8 mu m) and 5 (12 mu m) and the OLR from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments. We investigate the applicability of this method to the first generation of AVHRR instrument (AVHRR/1) for which no Channel 5 observation is available. A second step concerns the estimation of daily and monthly OLR from the instantaneous AVHRR overpasses. This step is especially important given the changes in the local time of the observations due to the orbital drift of the NOAA satellites. We investigate the use of OLR in the ERA5 reanalysis to estimate the diurnal variation. The developed approach proves to be valuable to model the diurnal change in OLR due to day/night time warming/cooling over clear land. Finally, the resulting monthly mean AVHRR OLR product is intercompared with the CERES monthly mean product. For a typical configuration with one morning and one afternoon AVHRR observation, the Root Mean Square (RMS) difference with CERES monthly mean OLR is about 2 Wm(-2) at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution. We quantify the degradation of the OLR product when only one AVHRR instrument is available (as is the case for some periods in the 1980s) and also the improvement when more instruments are available (e.g., using METOP-A, NOAA-15, NOAA-18, and NOAA-19 in 2012). The degradation of the OLR product from AVHRR/1 instruments is also quantified, which is done by "masking" the Channel 5 observations.

TI  - Local indicators for global species: Pelagic sharks in the tropical northeast Atlantic, Cabo Verde islands region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pelagic sharks are an important bycatch in pelagic fisheries, especially for drifting longlines targeting swordfish. In the Cabo Verde Archipelago (tropical NE Atlantic), pelagic shark catches can reach a significant proportion of the total catches. Due to the increased concern on the status of pelagic shark species, this study was developed to enhance the current knowledge of those sharks in the Cabo Verde region in comparison to the adjacent areas, especially associated with European Union (EU) pelagic longline fishing activity. Stock status indicators for the two main species, blue shark (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), were developed, based on fisheries data from logbooks and onboard scientific observers, including analysis of size frequency distributions and standardized catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) indexes over time. The standardized CPUEs have been stable or increasing for both species in the past 10 years, indicating no signs of local depletion. In terms of sizes, the blue shark catch is composed mainly of adults, which can be a sign of a stable population. On the contrary, the catch of shortfin mako is composed mainly of juveniles, which in conjunction of a decrease of mean size might be a cause of concern, highlighting possible overfishing on the species in the region. Thirty satellite tags, 25 archival miniPATs and 5 SPOT GPS, were deployed in the Cabo Verde Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), showing that those species are highly mobile. The biomass and size distributions were modeled with spatial and seasonal models (GAMs) identifying locations where juveniles are predominantly concentrated and that should be prioritized for conservation. This work presents new information on the status of pelagic sharks in the Cabo Verde region in the context of those highly migratory species, and can now be used to promote more sustainable fisheries in the region.

TI  - From Trees to Ecosystems: Spatiotemporal Scaling of Climatic Impacts on Montane Landscapes Using Dendrochronological, Isotopic, and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - An interdisciplinary approach is needed for understanding tree physiology and forest biogeochemical cycles undergoing climate change and rising atmospheric CO2. We combined tree ring time series, wood isotope signatures, remotely sensed variables, and climatic data to perform a spatiotemporal scaling analysis of tree physiology and high-elevation forest responses to rising CO2. The main question addressed is how tree physiological performance of dominant trees can be combined with satellite-derived information of stand-level productivity to understand how the landscape shapes the relationship between forest structure and function. Annually resolved tree ring carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios (delta C-13 and delta O-18), carbon isotope discrimination from CO2 to wood (Delta C-13), and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) of dominant Pinus hartwegii Lindl. trees were sampled and compared against stand-level normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from 2000 to 2016. Linear mixed-effects models tested the effects of elevation, aspect, and time. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were correlated with NDVI mainly for the previous fall-winter season and for the beginning of the growing season. Wood delta C-13 decreased over time regardless of spatial position, whereas wood delta O-18 varied as a function of altitude and time. Although Delta C-13 did not vary with elevation, aspect, or time, a notable decline in Delta C-13 and peak in iWUE during a severe drought event was evident. Results highlight the link between remotely sensed data, tree ring isotopic composition, and tree physiology as the determining factors to determine spatiotemporal variability in dendroecological studies.

TI  - Multicentric breast cancer with heterogeneous histopathology: a multidisciplinary review
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Multiple synchronous (multifocal or multicentric) ipsilateral breast cancers with heterogeneous histopathology are a rare clinical occurrence, however, their incidence is increasing due to the use of MRI for breast cancer screening and staging. Some studies have demonstrated poorer clinical outcomes for this pattern of breast cancer, but there is no evidence to guide clinical practice. In this multidisciplinary review, we reflect on pathology and molecular characteristics, imaging findings, surgical management including conservation and reconstructive options and approach to the axilla, and the role of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Multidisciplinary discussions appear decisive in planning an appropriate surgical choice and defining the correct systemic treatment tailored to each clinical condition.

TI  - Combining positron emission tomography/computed tomography, radiomics, and sentinel lymph node mapping for nodal staging of endometrial cancer patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the combination of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in women with apparent early-stage endometrial carcinoma. The correlation between radiomics features extracted from PET images of the primary tumor and the presence of nodal metastases was also analyzed.MethodsFrom November 2006 to March 2019, 167 patients with endometrial cancer were included. All women underwent PET/CT and surgical staging: 60/167 underwent systematic lymphadenectomy (Group 1) while, more recently, 107/167 underwent SLN biopsy (Group 2) with technetium-99m +blue dye or indocyanine green. Histology was used as standard reference. PET endometrial lesions were segmented (n=98); 167 radiomics features were computed inside tumor contours using standard Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) methods. Radiomics features associated with lymph node metastases were identified (Mann-Whitney test) in the training group (A); receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC) values were computed and optimal cut-off (Youden index) were assessed in the test group (B).ResultsIn Group 1, eight patients had nodal metastases (13%): seven correctly ridentified by PET/CT true-positive with one false-negative case. In Group 2, 27 patients (25%) had nodal metastases: 13 true-positive and 14 false-negative. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PET/CT for pelvic nodal metastases were 87%, 94%, 93%, 70%, and 98% in Group 1 and 48%, 97%, 85%, 87%, and 85% in Group 2, respectively. On radiomics analysis a significant association was found between the presence of lymph node metastases and 64 features. Volume-density, a measurement of shape irregularity, was the most predictive feature (p=0001, AUC=0,77, cut-off 0.35). When testing cut-off in Group B to discriminate metastatic tumors, PET false-negative findings were reduced from 14 to 8 (-43%).ConclusionsPET/CT demonstrated high specificity in detecting nodal metastases. SLN and histologic ultrastaging increased false-negative PET/CT findings, reducing the sensitivity of the technique. PET radiomics features of the primary tumor seem promising for predicting the presence of nodal metastases not detected by visual analysis.

TI  - Surface albedo as a proxy for land-cover clearing in seasonally dry forests: Evidence from the Brazilian Caatinga
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing increase in human and climate pressures, in addition to the lack of monitoring initiatives, makes the Caatinga one of the most vulnerable forests in the world. The Caatinga is located in the semi-arid region of Brazil and its vegetation phenology is highly dependent on precipitation, which has a high spatial and temporal variability. Under these circumstances, satellite image-based methods are valued due to their ability to uncover human-induced changes from climate effects on land cover. In this study, a time series stack of 670 Landsat images over a period of 31 years (1985-2015) was used to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of landcover clearing (LCC) due to vegetation removal in an area of the Caatinga. We compared the LCC detection accuracy of three spectral indices, i.e., the surface albedo (SA), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We applied a residual trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) to attenuate seasonal climate effects on the vegetation time series signal and to detect only significant structural changes (breakpoints) from monthly Landsat time series. Our results show that SA was able to identify the general occurrence of LCC and the year that it occurred with a higher accuracy (89 and 62%, respectively) compared to EVI (44 and 22%) and NDVI (46 and 22%). The overall outcome of the study shows the benefits of using Landsat time series and a spectral index that incorporates the short-wave infrared range, such as the SA, compared to visible and near-infrared vegetation indices for monitoring LCC in seasonally dry forests such as the Caatinga.

TI  - Preliminary risk assessment of workplace violence in hospital emergency departments
T2  - ANNALI DI IGIENE MEDICINA PREVENTIVA E DI COMUNITA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The risk assessment of workplace violence in emergency departments represents a global challenge for both healthcare organizations and workers. Recent studies have revealed increased rates of workplace violence towards physicians and nurses employed in emergency departments and have shown that type II is the most common typology of workplace violence among the four types of workplace violence defined by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The present study aimed to develop a methodological technique for a preliminary assessment of type II workplace violence risk in emergency departments.Methods. The Delphi method was used to develop a questionnaire entitled Emergency Department Workplace Violence-Questionnaire which was composed of two sections: 1) sentinel events, and 2) risk factors. The authors used the Emergency Department Workplace Violence-Questionnaire to evaluate the workplace violence risk among physicians and nurses employed in a hospital emergency department.Results. The Emergency Department Workplace Violence-Questionnaire was composed of 21 items. The sentinel events section consisted of three company indicators related to workplace violence and identified three areas of risk. The risk factors section identified 18 organizational and environmental factors associated with workplace violence occurrence. The assessment of workplace violence risk in the targeted hospital emergency departments, obtained through the use of the Emergency Department Workplace Violence-Questionnaire, showed a medium risk of workplace violence for both physicians (score=18) and nurses (score=19.5); the analysis found objective risk factors associated with workplace violence and led us to suggest organizational and environmental interventions for reducing the sources of risk among healthcare workers and to prioritize the interventions targeted at the problematical issues detected by the Emergency Department Workplace Violence-Questionnaire. The corrective interventions were focused on an engineering level (i.e. absence of areas for patients/clients to de-escalate, absence of alarm systems) and regarding the organizational environment (i.e. absence of a Workplace Violence Task Force to assess workplace violence risk and develop solutions, working alone).Conclusions. The proposed questionnaire proved to be a valid, structured, and reliable tool for assessing the risk of workplace violence in the targeted emergency departments and allowed for the identification of improvement actions targeted at specific critical issues which could be minimized through strategic interventions.

TI  - Evolution of land use and vegetation cover in the pioneering subwatershed "<i>Conservador das Aguas</i>" project (2006-2018)
T2  - REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in three subwatersheds essential for the hydrodynamics of Jaguari River (Ribeirao das Posses, Forjos and Saltos) after the implementation of the "Conservador das Aguas" project in the municipality of Extrema (MG). We used satellite images from TM-Landsat-5 from year 2006 and OLI-Landsat-8 from year 2018 to map land use and vegetation cover, and the SPRING software to classify images in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and quantify the occurrence of the classes analyzed in 2006 and 2018. After these analyses, we observed 19,77% increase in vegetation cover in the three subwatersheds. Surprisingly, we also detected a similar result in adjacent subwatersheds where the project was not implemented. Thus, this study suggests a positive effect of the "Conservador das Aguas" project to the maintenance of biodiversity and hydric system functioning of that region, resulting in increased environmental quality standards and effectiveness of the environmental services for the community and its properties.

TI  - Satellite-based remote sensing rapidly reveals extensive record of Holocene coastal settlement on Madagascar
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite decades of archaeological research, roughly 75% of Madagascar's land area remains archaeologically unexplored and the oldest sites on the island are difficult to locate, as they contain the ephemeral remains of mobile hunter/forager campsites. The known archaeological record is therefore biased toward later sites, especially sites dating to the second millennium AD, following the expansion of Indian Ocean trading networks. Systematic archaeological investigations are required to address these biases in the known archaeological record and clarify the island's early human history, but funding limitations, logistical and time constraints in surveying large areas and a relatively small number of active field archaeologists present substantial barriers to expansive areal survey coverage. Using theoretical models derived from human behavioral ecology (i.e., ideal free distribution, optimal foraging theory) in conjunction with freely available remote sensing data, we illustrate how archaeological survey of Madagascar's landscapes can be rapidly expanded, more effectively target early archaeological deposits, and address questions about the island's settlement. This study illustrates the potential for theoretically-driven satellite-based remote sensing analysis to improve our understanding of the archaeological record of the world's fourth largest island.

TI  - Improved estimates of mangrove cover and change reveal catastrophic deforestation in Myanmar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the world's most threatened ecosystems, and Myanmar is regarded as the current mangrove deforestation hotspot globally. Here, we use multi-sensor satellite data and Intensity Analysis to quantify and explain patterns of net and gross mangrove cover change (loss, gain, persistence) for the 1996-2016 period across all of Myanmar. Net national mangrove cover declined by 52% over 20 years, with annual net loss rates of 3.60%-3.87%. Gross mangrove deforestation was more profound: 63% of the 1996 mangrove extent had been temporarily or permanently converted by 2016. Rice, oil palm, and rubber expansion accounted for most conversion; however, our analysis revealed targeted systematic transitions of mangroves to water (presumably aquaculture) and built-up areas indicated emerging threats for mangroves from those land uses. Restoration programmes facilitated mangrove gains and represent a critical area for investment alongside protection. This study demonstrates the importance of multi-sensor satellite data for national-level mangrove change assessments, along with gross land cover transition analyses to assess landscape dynamics as well as prioritise threats and interventions in an effort to develop holistic strategies that aim to conserve important habitats.

TI  - Change Detection of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon Using Landsat Data and Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping deforestation is an essential step in the process of managing tropical rainforests. It lets us understand and monitor both legal and illegal deforestation and its implications, which include the effect deforestation may have on climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Given that there is ample room for improvements when it comes to mapping deforestation using satellite imagery, in this study, we aimed to test and evaluate the use of algorithms belonging to the growing field of deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to this end. Although studies have been using DL algorithms for a variety of remote sensing tasks for the past few years, they are still relatively unexplored for deforestation mapping. We attempted to map the deforestation between images approximately one year apart, specifically between 2017 and 2018 and between 2018 and 2019. Three CNN architectures that are available in the literature-SharpMask, U-Net, and ResUnet-were used to classify the change between years and were then compared to two classic machine learning (ML) algorithms-random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-as points of reference. After validation, we found that the DL models were better in most performance metrics including the Kappa index, F1 score, and mean intersection over union (mIoU) measure, while the ResUnet model achieved the best overall results with a value of 0.94 in all three measures in both time sequences. Visually, the DL models also provided classifications with better defined deforestation patches and did not need any sort of post-processing to remove noise, unlike the ML models, which needed some noise removal to improve results.

TI  - PACO: Python-Based Atmospheric Correction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric correction of satellite images based on radiative transfer calculations is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. The software package ATCOR, developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is a versatile atmospheric correction software, capable of processing data acquired by many different optical satellite sensors. Based on this well established algorithm, a new Python-based atmospheric correction software has been developed to generate L2A products of Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and of new space-based hyperspectral sensors such as DESIS (DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) and EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program). This paper outlines the underlying algorithms of PACO, and presents the validation results by comparing L2A products generated from Sentinel-2 L1C images with in situ (AERONET and RadCalNet) data within VNIR-SWIR spectral wavelengths range.

TI  - Mapping Functional Urban Green Types Using High Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces are known to provide ample benefits to human society and hence play a vital role in safeguarding the quality of life in our cities. In order to optimize the design and management of green spaces with regard to the provisioning of these ecosystem services, there is a clear need for uniform and spatially explicit datasets on the existing urban green infrastructure. Current mapping approaches, however, largely focus on large land use units (e.g., park, garden), or broad land cover classes (e.g., tree, grass), not providing sufficient thematic detail to model urban ecosystem service supply. We therefore proposed a functional urban green typology and explored the potential of both passive (2 m-hyperspectral and 0.5 m-multispectral optical imagery) and active (airborne LiDAR) remote sensing technology for mapping the proposed types using object-based image analysis and machine learning. Airborne LiDAR data was found to be the most valuable dataset overall, while fusion with hyperspectral data was essential for mapping the most detailed classes. High spectral similarities, along with adjacency and shadow effects still caused severe confusion, resulting in class-wise accuracies <50% for some detailed functional types. Further research should focus on the use of multi-temporal image analysis to fully unlock the potential of remote sensing data for detailed urban green mapping.

TI  - Seasonality Analysis of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Backscattered Power over Salar de Aguas Calientes Sur, Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes control the development of salt crust over the Salar de Aguas Calientes Sur located in Andes Highlands, Chile. Precipitations throughout the Altiplanic winter (December to March) and austral winter (June to September) caused ponds to enlarge and surface salt crusts to dissolve driving roughness and dielectric features of the salar surface change over time. A four-year time series backscattering coefficient analysis, obtained by Sentinel 1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 with 10 m of spatial resolution, demonstrated the capability of microwaves to discriminate seasonal patterns illustrated in this paper. Both sensors showed to be sensitive to changes in the surface crust due to weather conditions. Backscattered power gradually increased during the driest months as the rough salt crusts develop and decreased rapidly due to precipitations or flooding events, which lead to a smoothing appearance to radar. The high temporal frequency of acquisition in Sentinel 1 (5-13 scenes/month) allowed the discrimination among climate and annual seasonality and episodic events in the C-band backscatter coefficient. On the other hand, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 showed subsurface changes at L-band since the salinity of the brine in the soil reduces the penetration depth of backscattered power for shorter wavelengths. Results might be useful to monitor salars with geographic and weather conditions similar to Salar de Aguas Calientes Sur.

TI  - Continuous subpixel monitoring of urban impervious surface using Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method called Continuous Subpixel Monitoring (CSM) was developed to map and monitor urban impervious surface change continuously at the subpixel level. Time series model of each pixel was first estimated based on clear Landsat observations between 2000 and 2014, and any land surface change was detected by the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. These coefficients and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of the estimated time series models were then employed as the inputs of random forest regressor. A few experiments with different combinations of variables and bands were explored to better construct random forest regression models. We successfully applied this algorithm to map subpixel urban impervious surface area (ISA%) and characterize its dynamics in Broome County, New York. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results and analyses. First, the integration of subpixel mapping technique and time series analysis in CSM can yield a relatively satisfactory ISA% result at one point in time. With higher precision and smaller bias, its mapping accuracy is better than that of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) percent developed imperviousness product, without using extensive auxiliary data, such as nighttime light image and transportation network. Second, the ISA% change of any time interval can be easily derived and detected by CSM with relatively high accuracy, which have the potential to generate sub-annual ISA% change products. Furthermore, this approach can detect not only urban expansion/intensification (ISA% gain), but also different patterns of urban transitions overtime, such as urban demolition/redevelopment to vegetation (ISA% loss), and surface modifications (no mechanical change). Finally, CSM works well in one of the cloudiest regions in the United States. This algorithm could provide a new direction to map and monitor percent urban impervious surface change in a reliable and efficient way, which also has the potential to apply to other land cover types (e.g., tree, shrub, and barren lands) at the subpixel level.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of the spectral response in mangroves of Havana, Cuba, by remote sensing
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Mangroves are one of the most important forest types because of their ecosystem services and ecological roles. They represent 5 % of the emerged land of Cuba. No previous studies are describing spectral vegetation indexes variations by remote sensing in Cuban mangroves, but these variables can be used as indicators of the conservation status of the ecosystem and sustain national wide assessments. Objective: in the current paper we describe spatial and temporal variations in two spectral vegetation indexes in four near-city mangroves at Havana, Cuba and compare them to a natural control site. Methods: Study was conducted in localities named: Bajo de Santa Ana, Cojimar, Rincon de Guanabo, and El Cobre - Itabo lagoon and as control site was selected northern Zapata swamp. By using Climate Engine platform we extract, from 2 460 Landsat satellite images, mean values of spectral indexes NDVI and EVI in 5 parcels per locality, from 1984 to 2019. Variables were statistically compared among localities and the global trend was described. Results: We detect geographic differences in both indexes, which can be related to structural properties and conservation degree of mangroves in each locality. Global trend of indexes was to increase, but differently among localities. Slighter changes appear in the control site and, among near city mangroves, in Rincon de Guanabo and Cojimar. The ordering of localities from spectral variables was consistent with the ranking in general conservation degree. Conclusions: Spectral responses describe uniquely each mangrove forest, in concordance to each ecological and conservation characteristics. There is a need for promoting studies using remote sensors at these forest types and to generate strong and reliable indicators that can sustain future researches and monitoring schemes in Caribbean mangroves.

TI  - Remote Sensing Derived Indices for Tracking Urban Land Surface Change in Case of Earthquake Recovery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of post-disaster recovery requires an understanding of the reconstruction process and growth trend of the impacted regions. In case of earthquakes, while remote sensing has been applied for response and damage assessment, its application has not been investigated thoroughly for monitoring the recovery dynamics in spatially and temporally explicit dimensions. The need and necessity for tracking the change in the built-environment through time is essential for post-disaster recovery modeling, and remote sensing is particularly useful for obtaining this information when other sources of data are scarce or unavailable. Additionally, the longitudinal study of repeated observations over time in the built-up areas has its own complexities and limitations. Hence, a model is needed to overcome these barriers to extract the temporal variations from before to after the disaster event. In this study, a method is introduced by using three spectral indices of UI (urban index), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and MNDWI (modified normalized difference water index) in a conditional algebra, to build a knowledge-based classifier for extracting the urban/built-up features. This method enables more precise distinction of features based on environmental and socioeconomic variability, by providing flexibility in defining the indices' thresholds with the conditional algebra statements according to local characteristics. The proposed method is applied and implemented in three earthquake cases: New Zealand in 2010, Italy in 2009, and Iran in 2003. The overall accuracies of all built-up/non-urban classifications range between 92% to 96.29%; and the Kappa values vary from 0.79 to 0.91. The annual analysis of each case, spanning from 10 years pre-event, immediate post-event, and until present time (2019), demonstrates the inter-annual change in urban/built-up land surface of the three cases. Results in this study allow a deeper understanding of how the earthquake has impacted the region and how the urban growth is altered after the disaster.

TI  - Digital soil mapping of key GlobalSoilMap properties in Northern Karnataka Plateau
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and quantitative information on soil properties of each and every location is essential for site specific sustainable management of land resources. A study was conducted to predict the different key soil properties of Northern Karnataka as per GlobalSoilMap specifications using Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) Model. Along with Sentinel-2 data, terrain attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, topographic position index, plan and profile curvature, multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness, multi-resolution ridge top flatness and vegetation factors like NDVI and EVI were used as covariates. Equalarea quadratic splines were fitted to soil profile datasets to estimate soil properties viz. pH, OC, CEC, clay, sand, silt, field capacity and permanent wilting point at six standard soil depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 and 100-200 cm) as per GlobalSoilMap specifications. The coefficient of determination (R-2), mean error (ME) and root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated in order to assess model performance. Prediction interval coverage percentage (PICP) was calculated to evaluate the associated uncertainty predictions. The predicted soil properties are reliable with minimum errors and the QRF model captured maximum variability for most of the soil properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Annual and monthly analysis of surface urban heat island intensity with respect to the local climate zones in Budapest
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up areas with non-natural surface covers generate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. To investigate this in greater spatial extensions, satellite data provide sufficient spatial coverage without unnecessary time lag effect within the region. Moreover, it is very costly to operate a meteorological station system with a suitable density. Although the cost of maintaining satellites is also high, however, a lot of satellite data is available free of charge to users. For instance, surface temperature data derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) measurements can be used to obtain surface temperature-based UHI (SUHI) intensity. Due to the variability of built-up density and vegetation cover within the city, different subregions can be characterized by the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) system. The main goal of the paper is to analyse the relationship between the SUHI intensity and the LCZ classes for Budapest. SUHI intensity values were determined relative to the average surface temperature of the surrounding rural areas. Our conclusions clearly show that as building density decreases, the SUHI intensities also decrease. The highest intensities can be found in the city centre, and the lowest SUHI intensities with negative values (i.e. adverse or cooling effect) appear in vegetation-covered LCZ classes. The SUHI intensity variability is generally greater in summer than winter, which can be detected in case of all LCZ classes due to the substantial difference of incoming solar radiation.

TI  - A validated ensemble method for multinomial land-cover classification
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover data provides valuable information for landscape management and can be generated using machine learning algorithms. Ensemble models or model averaging can overcome difficulties in selecting an adequate algorithm and improve model predictions, but its use is limited among ecologists. The objective of this study is to highlight the benefits and limitations of weighted and unweighted majority voting ensemble models for land-cover classification and to enable easy and wider implementation of the method by providing an R-script (for use in the R software). Using a case study of three mixed-use landscapes from southern Australia (Tasmania), land cover was classified into six classes using Landsat 8 imagery and ancillary data, and support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayesian as base algorithms. The predicted classifications of the base algorithms were then averaged using both an unweighted and weighted (using the true skill statistic) majority voting ensemble algorithm. Cross-validation results showed the base algorithms achieved similar accuracy making algorithm selection difficult. The base algorithms achieved high and similar predictive accuracy when the classified land-cover and training data belong to the same geographic region but lower and different predictive accuracy when the classified land-cover and training data belong to different geographic regions. The weighted and unweighted ensemble achieved similar overall accuracy, equivalent to the best performing base algorithm. We conclude that the majority voting ensemble can be adopted to overcome difficulties in model selection during land-cover classification.

TI  - Optimized Segmentation Based on the Weighted Aggregation Method for Loess Bank Gully Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Loess Plateau suffers severe gully erosion. Gully mapping is a fundamental task for gully erosion monitoring in this region. Among the different gully types in the Loess Plateau, the bank gully is usually regarded as the most important source for the generation of sediment. However, approaches for bank gully extraction are still limited. This study put forward an integrated framework, including segmentation optimization, evaluation and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-based classification, for the bank gully mapping of Zhifanggou catchment in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The approach was conducted using a 1-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM), based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and WorldView-3 imagery. The methodology first divided the study area into different watersheds. Then, segmentation by weighted aggregation (SWA) was implemented to generate multi-level segments. For achieving an optimum segmentation, area-weighted variance (WV) and Moran's I (MI) were adopted and calculated within each sub-watershed. After that, a new discrepancy metric, the area-number index (ANI), was developed for evaluating the segmentation results, and the results were compared with the multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm. Finally, bank gully mappings were obtained based on the XGBoost model after fine-tuning. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior segmentation compared to MRS. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the bank gully extraction results was 78.57%. The proposed approach provides a credible tool for mapping bank gullies, which could be useful for the catchment-scale gully erosion process.

TI  - Phenology-Based Rice Paddy Mapping Using Multi-Source Satellite Imagery and a Fusion Algorithm Applied to the Poyang Lake Plain, Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about the spatiotemporal patterns of rice paddies is essential for the assessment of food security, management of agricultural resources, and sustainability of ecosystems. However, accurate spatial datasets of rice paddy fields and multi-cropping at fine resolution are still lacking. Landsat observation is the primary source of remote sensing data that has continuously mapped regional rice paddy fields at a 30-m spatial resolution since the 1980s. However, Landsat data used for rice paddy studies reveals some challenges, especially data quality issues (e.g., cloud cover). Here, we present an algorithm that integrates time-series Landsat and MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images with a phenology-based approach (ILMP) to map rice paddy planting fields and multi-cropping patterns. First, a fusion of MODIS and Landsat data was used to reduce the cloud contamination, which added more information to the Landsat time series data. Second, the unique biophysical features of rice paddies during the flooding and open-canopy periods (which can be captured by the dynamics of the vegetation indices) were used to identify rice paddy regions as well as those of multi-cropping. This algorithm was tested for 2015 in Nanchang County, which is located on the Poyang Lake plain in southern China. We evaluated the resultant map of the rice paddy and multi-cropping systems using ground-truth data and Google Earth images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the rice paddy planting areas were 93.66% and 0.85, respectively. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the multi-cropping regions were 92.95% and 0.89, respectively. In addition, our algorithm was more capable of capturing detailed information about areas with fragmented cropland than that of the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) from 2015. These results demonstrated the great potential of our algorithm for mapping rice paddy fields and using the multi-cropping index in complex landscapes in southern China.

TI  - The Effect of Topographic Correction on Forest Tree Species Classification Accuracy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic correction can reduce the influences of topographic factors and improve the accuracy of forest tree species classification when using remote-sensing data to investigate forest resources. In this study, the Mount Taishan forest farm is the research area. Based on Landsat 8 OLI data and field survey subcompartment data, four topographic correction models (cosine model, C model, solar-canopy-sensor (SCS)+C model and empirical rotation model) were used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to carry out algorithmic data correction. Then, the tree species in the study area were classified by the random forest method. Combined with the tree species classification process, the topographic correction effects were analyzed, and the effects, advantages and disadvantages of each correction model were evaluated. The results showed that the SCS+C model and empirical rotation model were the best models in terms of visual effect, reducing the band standard deviation and adjusting the reflectance distribution. When we used the SCS+C model to correct the remote-sensing image, the total accuracy increased by 4% when using the full-coverage training areas to classify tree species and by nearly 13% when using the shadowless training area. In the illumination condition interval of 0.4-0.6, the inconsistency rate decreased significantly; however, the inconsistency rate increased with increasing illumination condition values. Topographic correction can enhance reflectance information in shaded areas and can significantly improve the image quality. Topographic correction can be used as a pretreatment method for forest species classification when the study area's dominant tree species are in a low light intensity area.

TI  - Integrating spaceborne optical and SAR imagery for monitoring mangroves and <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> in Zhangjiang Estuary
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are an important type of coastal wetlands with ecological, environmental, economic, and cultural values. Spartina alterniflora is an invasive alien plant, threatening mangroves in China. The competition between Spartina alterniflora and mangroves is an important ecological issue along the southeast coast of China. Accurate monitoring of Spartina alterniflora and mangroves with remote sensing is of great significance for scientific protection of mangrove ecosystems. We propose a new method to monitor Spartina alterniflora and mangroves, integrating Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The Yunxiao National Nature Reserve of Mangroves, located in Zhangjiang Estuary, Fujian, China, is chosen as the study area. We select one Sentinel-2A image at low tide in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to obtain the spectral and texture information of vegetation and other objects. The new method comprises of three steps: 1) use rules related to NDVI, EVI, LSWI, and DEM to get the potential masks of Spartina alterniflora and mangroves; 2) use random forest classification method to distinguish Spartina alterniflora and mangroves further; and 3) use all Sentinel-1 A/B images in that year to get the estuarine yearlong seawater body, and use the criterion interaction with sea water to refine the detected Spartina alterniflora and mangroves. The random forest classifier is found suitable for mapping wetlands with overall accuracy of 98.53%, 96.52% and 98.71%, and Kappa coefficients of 0.980, 0.952 and 0.978 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The total areas of the detected Spartina alterniflora and mangroves in the study region are 109.23 and 56.85 hm(2) in 2016, 124.00 and 59.88 hm(2) in 2017, and 142.39 and 58.61 hm(2) in 2018, respectively, consistent with previous research results in terms of spatial distribution and magnitude of the area.

TI  - Application of Convolutional Neural Network on Lei Bamboo Above-Ground-Biomass (AGB) Estimation Using Worldview-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) directly relates to the productivity of forests. Precisely, AGB mapping for regional forests based on very high resolution (VHR) imagery is widely needed for evaluation of productivity. However, the diversity of variables and algorithms and the difficulties inherent in high resolution optical imagery make it complex. In this paper, we explored the potentials of the state-of-art algorithm convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used for its high-level representation, but rarely applied for AGB estimation. Four experiments were carried out to compare the performance of CNNs and other state-of-art Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: (1) performance of CNN using bands, (2) performance of Random Forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) on bands, and vegetation indices (VIs). (3) Performance of RF, SVR, and ANN on gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), and (4) performance of RF, SVR, and ANN based on all combined data and ESDA+VIs. CNNs reached satisfactory results (with R-2 = 0.943) even with limited input variables (i.e., only bands). In comparison, RF and SVR with elaborately designed data obtained slightly better accuracy than CNN. For examples, RF based on GLCM textures reached an R-2 of 0.979 and RF based on all combined data reached a close R-2 of 0.974. However, the results of ANN were much worse (with the best R-2 of 0.885).

TI  - URBAN MIDDLE STRATA IN POST-REFORM RUSSIA: STATUS AND SOCIAL POSITION IN THE ASSESSMENTS OF GERMAN HISTORIANS OF THE 1970-IES AND THE 1990-IES
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the late 1970-ies the Germanic studies of Russia had a certain interest in the position of the urban middle strata in the Russian Empire of the post-reform era. At the same time, the attempts were made to determine the composition of this population category, to correlate its status with traditional philistinism, to reveal the process of capitalist transformation of the latter in the second half of the nineteenth century. When they consider the position of the corresponding social group, researchers usually adhered to a formal legal approach, referring to "philistinism" as a class category. At the same time, since the last two decades of the 20th century, the Germanic studies of Russia accept the stratification of philistinism, and the considerable conventionality of this definition concerning the middle urban layers of the late 19th century. Recognizing the transformation of philistinism in the structures of the emerging bourgeois society since the 1860-ies with the influence of government policy, German researchers, especially M. Hildermayer, who paid the most attention to the problem, also point to the complexity, the unevenness of this process, as well as to a certain inconsistency of the imperial power in its assistance. At the same time K. Gestwa's research testifies a certain stability of traditional middle layers that are not always imbued with a specifically bourgeois worldview.

TI  - Modeling the spatial distribution of wood volume in a Cerrado <i>Stricto Sensu</i> remnant in Minas Gerais state, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Savanna, the second largest biome in the country, has scarce information about its wood volume production. Since our aim was to contribute to the better wood volume characterization in Brazilian Savanna vegetation, we conducted a case study in a Cerrado Sensu Stricto remnant in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, using different approaches and datasets to model the spatial distribution of wood volume, including forest inventory data, remotely-sensed imagery, and geostatistical models. Wood volume data were obtained from a forest inventory carried out in the field. Spectral data were collected from a Landsat 5 TM satellite image, composed of spectral bands and vegetation indices. Ordinary kriging, multiple linear regression analysis, and regression kriging methods were used for wood volume estimation. Ordinary kriging resulted in estimates closer to each other in non-sampled areas (less variability) than the other methods for not considering information from these areas in the interpolation process. As multiple linear regression and regression kriging take into account the spectral data from remotely-sensed images, these methods provide higher discrimination potential for wood volume estimate mapping when vegetation presents high spatial heterogeneity, as in the Cerrado Sensu Stricto. Integration between field data, remotely-sensed imagery and geostatistical models provides a potential approach to spatially estimate wood volume in native vegetation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of energy exchange and evapotranspiration during an intense drought for drylands in Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga biome, located in the northeastern region of Brazil, is the most populated dryland region on the planet and extremely vulnerable to land degradation due to climatological and anthropogenic factors. Energy partitioning substantially influences the local climate and affects the water cycle, which is of utmost importance for the economy and livelihood of the region. Recently, eddy covariance (EC) towers were installed in the area; thus, the scientific community can thoroughly assess the water and energy fluxes over this unique biome. While EC towers have a high degree of accuracy, they only measure energy fluxes over a small land footprint. Given the biome spatial heterogeneity, the use of EC-based techniques has the limitation of not comprehensively representing water and energy fluxes profiles over the entire region. Incorporating remote sensing (RS) data into the landscape analysis is a feasible solution to overcome this issue, given that satellite data can capture the phenomena represented by the EC measurements across large spatial scales. Our research studied the capability of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and MOD16-ET products to represent the EC measurements regarding energy and mass exchange, with an ultimate objective of applying the best approach to assess these fluxes regionally. We applied the SEBAL model using only remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The MOD16-ET model uses a different approach but is also based on MODIS data. Our analysis was based on three years (2014-2016) of data, which was limited to the availability of the EC tower data. We found that for the EC-based measurements, energy balance closure (EBC) achieved an average of 0.84, which is considerably high for the region. This is possibly due to the EC tower being installed on a preserved Caatinga plot, with reduced heterogeneity and higher plant density. When analyzing RS-based products to represent ET profiles in the region, we found that the SEBAL model accurately represented water fluxes during the wet season but not the dry season, whereas the MOD16-ET showed a better agreement with EC-based water fluxes throughout all the seasons. SEBAL inaccuracy in drylands is partially due to the narrow range between the cold and hot pixels in an image, as the algorithm relies on this range for input parameters, especially in the dry season. Therefore, we concluded that MOD16-ET is capable of better-representing water fluxes in the Caatinga region. We analyzed the fluxes regionally and quantified annual ET for the three years. These results are especially relevant for local policymakers on dealing with water and landscape issues in a region where the livelihood and well-being of the population is inextricably bound to water availability.

TI  - Remote sensing as a tool to determine biophysical parameters of irrigated seed corn crop
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many studies have been conducted combining orbital remote sensing data and crop growth models for vegetation monitoring, evapotranspiration estimation and quantification of biophysical parameters, e.g., NDVI, surface temperature, albedo, and biomass. The aim of the present study was to estimate evapotranspiration (ETr), biomass (BIO), and water productivity (WP) for irrigated seed corn crop using the SAFER algorithm and Landsat 8 satellite images. For this, eight cloud-free images were acquired at different phenological stages over the interest area on the United States Geological Survey website and meteorological data. ETr was estimated by the SAFER algorithm. BIO by the Monteith model, and WP by the BIO/ETr ratio. ETr values ranged from 0 to 6 mm d(-1), with the highest values coinciding with the period of high vegetative crop vigor, while the lowest values were found at the sowing season. The highest biomass values were observed from images at 46 and 62 days after sowing (DAS), corresponding to 286 and 289 kg ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. The highest mean of water productivity was observed at 62 DAS, with 6.9 kg m(-3) of water, corresponding to the period of maximum vegetative crop vigor. The application of the SAFER model together with Landsat 8 satellite images was an alternative to identifying the spatial and temporal variation of biophysical parameters of the corn crop. It could assist in the management of water in irrigated agriculture and decision making in large-sized farms.

TI  - Assessment of Burned Forest Area Severity and Postfire Regrowth in Chapada Diamantina National Park (Bahia, Brazil) Using dNBR and RdNBR Spectral Indices
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire scar detection through orbital data can be done using specific techniques, such as the use of spectral indices like the normalized burn ratio (NBR), which are designed to help identify burnt areas as they have typical spectral responses. This paper aims to characterize burn severity and regrowth in areas hit by three fires in the Chapada Diamantina National Park (Bahia, Brazil) and its surrounding area through the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) and relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) spectral indices. The data acquired were pretreated and prepared adequately to calculate the indices. We conclude that for the study area, considering the limitations of fieldwork, the multitemporal index dNBR and the relative index RdNBR are important tools for classifying burnt areas and can be used to assess the regrowth of vegetation.

TI  - An improved change detection approach using tri-temporal logic-verified change vector analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change vector analysis (CVA) is an effective and widely used unsupervised change detection algorithm in remote sensing. It separates changed pixels from unchanged pixels by binarizing bi-temporal difference image. However, the results and performance are affected by the image acquisitions at different dates and the threshold decision rules for change magnitudes, resulting in serious false and missed detections. This paper proposed a novel tri-temporal logic-verified change vector analysis (TLCVA) approach which can identify the errors of CVA through logical reasoning and judgement with an additional temporal image assistance. This approach can not only achieve a reliable modification to the original change detection results, but also produce two additional improved change detection results in the logical circulation of land surface change automatically. The proposed method consists of three parts: traditional CVA change detection, automated sample selection, and refined modification based on SVM posterior probability comparison in temporal space. It was experimented by land cover change detection from Sentinel-2 and Planet Labs images in three study areas located in Ma'anshan, Nanjing and Taizhou City. The results show that accuracies have significant improvements by the TLCVA approach, and omission and commission errors reduce obviously. The generalization, sensitivity and efficiency of the proposed approach were also analyzed in the experiments. It is concluded that different threshold decision methods of preliminary CVA in the proposed approach can work effectively and efficiently, and a small size of training samples selected from the automated sample decision method is enough to achieve improved change detection performance.

TI  - Remote Sensing Applications in Monitoring of Protected Areas: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of remote sensing platforms and sensors and improvement in science and technology provide crucial support for the monitoring and management of protected areas. This paper presents an analysis of research publications, from a bibliometric perspective, on the remote sensing of protected areas. This analysis is focused on the period from 1991 to 2018. For data, a total of 4546 academic publications were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The VOSviewer software was adopted to evaluate the co-authorships among countries and institutions, as well as the co-occurrences of author keywords. The results indicate an increasing trend of annual publications in the remote sensing of protected areas. This analysis reveals the major topical subjects, leading countries, and most influential institutions around the world that have conducted relevant research in scientific publications; this study also reveals the journals that include the most publications, and the collaborative patterns related to the remote sensing of protected areas. Landsat, MODIS, and LiDAR are among the most commonly used satellites and sensors. Research topics related to protected area monitoring are mainly concentrated on change detection, biodiversity conservation, and climate change impact. This analysis can help researchers and scholars better understand the intellectual structure of the field and identify the future research directions.

TI  - Space-Based Observations for Understanding Changes in the Arctic-Boreal Zone
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Observations taken over the last few decades indicate that dramatic changes are occurring in the Arctic-Boreal Zone (ABZ), which are having significant impacts on ABZ inhabitants, infrastructure, flora and fauna, and economies. While suitable for detecting overall change, the current capability is inadequate for systematic monitoring and for improving process-based and large-scale understanding of the integrated components of the ABZ, which includes the cryosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Such knowledge will lead to improvements in Earth system models, enabling more accurate prediction of future changes and development of informed adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this article, we review the strengths and limitations of current space-based observational capabilities for several important ABZ components and make recommendations for improving upon these current capabilities. We recommend an interdisciplinary and stepwise approach to develop a comprehensive ABZ Observing Network (ABZ-ON), beginning with an initial focus on observing networks designed to gain process-based understanding for individual ABZ components and systems that can then serve as the building blocks for a comprehensive ABZ-ON.

TI  - Evaluation of Novel Trapping Lures for Monitoring Exotic and Native Container-Inhabiting <i>Aedes</i> spp. (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance for diurnal container-inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald), and Aedes triseriatus (Say) have routinely relied on the deployment of multiple trap types, including CO2-baited light traps, gravid traps, oviposition traps, and BG-Sentinel. These trap configurations have met with varying degrees of effectiveness and in many instances likely under-sample these key mosquito vectors. Most recently, the BG-Sentinel trap used in conjunction with the human-scent lure has been largely accepted as the gold-standard for monitoring Ae. albopictus. However, its ability to attract other container-inhabiting Aedes species has not been fully evaluated. During 2018, we tested new scent lures, TrapTech Lure-A and Lure-H (Bedoukian Research, Inc.), using BG-Sentinel traps with CO2 in two regions of Connecticut, Stamford and Hamden, against the BG-Lure. Pooled mosquitoes were additionally screened for arbovirus infection. A total of 47,734 mosquitoes representing 8 genera and 32 species were captured during the study, with the Stamford site deriving on average three times as many mosquitoes per trap, adjusting for sampling effort. Lure-A and Lure-H outperformed the BG-Lure in terms of total numbers, diversity evenness, and the proportion of both Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus. There were no significant differences among lures in capturing Ae. albopictus, and in terms of species richness. Fifty-seven isolates of virus (West Nile, Jamestown Canyon, and La Crosse viruses) were obtained during the study, with no significant difference between trap-lure. We highlight both novel lures as effective attractants for use in mosquito surveillance=, which either outperform, or equal, BG-Lure.

TI  - Coastal wetland vegetation features and digital Change Detection Mapping based on remotely sensed imagery: El-Burullus Lake, Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - El-Burullus Lake is one of the four Egyptian Ramsar sites that constitute internationally important wetlands as they contain a rich biodiversity and have a large number of water bird species. But the valuable resources in El-Burullus Lake and its surrounding area have faced various threats to wetlands over recent decades. This study was carried out to evaluate the dynamics of land cover change using three change scenes of recent and past satellite data from 1990 to 2019. The study utilized ArcGIS10.7, ERDAS Imagine 14, Landsat TM (1990, 1999, and 2010), Landsat OLI-TIRS (2019) to analyze the land-use/land-cover (LULC) of El-Burullus wetland. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were employed to assess the change scenario of the area. Results indicated that vegetated land has increased significantly with a concomitant shrinkage in the water body and open soil during the study period. Approximately 53 km(2) (7.0%) of water body and 8.7 km(2) (1.3%) of open soil were lost, while vegetation areas expanded to approximately 29.9 km(2) (7.4%). Factors that underpin the observed changes in the area are; reclamation projects and fish-farms which are creating the danger of drying up of the southern coastal parts of the lake, as well as spreading of reed beds (mainly: Phragmites australis) that covers about 20% of El-Burullus lake which led to dry up the lake parts. Therefore, the study suggests the need for urgent attention on conservation of remaining wetland resources for sustainable utilization for the next generation.

TI  - Predicting Trace Metal Exposure in Aquatic Ecosystems: Evaluating DGT as a Biomonitoring Tool
T2  - EXPOSURE AND HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Exposure to trace metals is a leading factor associated with the development of non-communicable diseases. Aquatic ecosystems are not only effective agents of trace metal dispersion but are also at risk of contaminant enrichment. The use of sentinel organism as indicators of water quality is one method to evaluate potential human and ecological risk. An alternative or companion approach is to employ chemical techniques that mimic biotic accumulation/responses by aquatic fauna. The Diffusive Gradients-in-Thin-Films (DGT) technique has been widely used in bioavailability studies in water, soil and sediment. Many efforts have been made trying to understand the relationships between DGT labile determinations of trace elements and its biouptake by different organisms. However, the relationship between DGT labile determinations and the biological accumulation/response in aquatic animals is still not clear. The present work aims to improve the understanding of this relationship by summarizing the works using DGT devices and accumulation/response by animals in aquatic media. Several papers studying nineteen different elements in aquatic media are revised and discussed. The papers were separated and discussed in four categories: DGT and Biotic response, DGT and Bioaccumulation, DGT and Biomonitoring, and DGT and Bioturbation. DGT is expected to correlate well with the biological accumulation/responses in kinetically controlled situations. In biomonitoring studies, the use of chemical (DGT) and biological approaches gives complementary and high valuable information. The use of DGT and biological approaches should be considered in future studies about bioavailability and might improve the comprehension about uptake of trace metals by the aquatic fauna.

TI  - Epidemiology of severe cases of influenza and other acute respiratory infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, July 2016 to June 2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza surveillance systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have been strengthened in the past few years and 16 of the 19 countries in the Region with functional influenza surveillance systems report their influenza data to the EMFLU Network. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of circulating influenza viruses, causing SARI, and reported to the EMFLU during July 2016 to June 2018.Methods: Data included in this study were collected by 15 countries of the Region from 110 SARI sentinel surveillance sites over two influenza seasons.Results: A total of 40,917 cases of SARI were included in the study. Most cases [20,551 (50.2%)] were less than 5 years of age. Influenza virus was detected in 3995 patients, 2849 (11.8%) were influenza A and 1146 (4.8%) were influenza B. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant circulating subtype with 1666 cases (58.5%). Other than influenza, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common respiratory infection circulating, with 277 cases (35.9%).Conclusion: Influenza viruses cause a high number of severe respiratory infections in EMR. It is crucial for the countries to continue improving their influenza surveillance capacity in order detect any unusual influenza activity or new strain that may cause a pandemic.

TI  - Characterisation and mapping of land subsidence based on geodetic observations in Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The pervasive seasonal flooding, aquifer contamination, and saline water intrusion in parts of Lagos are some of the long-term effects of land subsidence caused by the excessive groundwater exploitation and land reclamation that has been taking place in the city. Efforts to monitor the extent and pattern of land deformation will help in many ways to mitigate the effects of flooding and other geohazards associated with land subsidence. In this study, we characterised and mapped the land subsidence in the Lagos city based on the analyses of geodetic data, which included Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Envisat, Sentinel-1, and GRACE data. We applied the SBAS technique to the Envisat and Sentinel-1 datasets acquired from 2004-2011 and 2015-2019, respectively, and to perform multi-temporal analyses and produce corresponding subsidence maps over the Lagos city. The GRACE data were used to infer the extent and trend of groundwater changes at the GPS location. The results indicate that the subsidence is a widespread phenomenon in Lagos city, with subsidence rates varying between -2 mm/year and -87 mm/year. The highest subsidence rate was observed around the coastal zones and areas where heavy structures are built on landfills. With the highest rate at present, subsidence has gradually increased in the last 15 years. With the development of indiscriminate groundwater exploitation, urbanization, and rapid population growth, the subsidence rate in Lagos city is likely to rise significantly in the coming years, which, in turn, may further escalate the flood rate and other associated geohazards.

TI  - Capitalizing on opportunities provided by pasture sudden death to enhance livestock sustainable management in Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has the largest commercial beef cattle stock on Earth, and most of the cattle produced in the country is bred and finished on pastures. The cattle ranching sector represents a significant source of the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural intensification has been highlighted as one of the main strategies in reaching global food security and reducing deforestation. The Sudden Death Disease (SDD) of pastures, which affects the most planted cultivar of Urochloa brizantha, is degrading pastures in the Amazon, contributing to low production yields and high emission rates. This paper discusses the intensification of pasture production systems and SDD, to examine the potential for pasture renovation to address livestock productivity and GHG balance, emissions and potential sinks. Does SDD represent a blessing or a curse to climate change mitigation in the Brazilian Amazon? A collection of pasture samples were assessed to measure wet and dry weight in areas with and without SDD, which were related to remote sensing data to provide an overall estimate of the total area affected by the SDD in Alta Floresta, a municipal county of southern Brazilian Amazonia. We found that 77.1% of all pastures had been committed to the syndrome, which has forced farmers to renew their pastures. This also has great potential in increasing soil carbon stocks, effectively reducing the CO2 footprint of meat production in those areas. Therefore, we firmly believe that SDD management has provided an opportunity to rebalance the emissions/sequestration equation associated with meat production by the cattle ranching sector in this Amazonin frontier.

TI  - A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHOR OF "HEAD" IN FERDOWSI'S SHAHNAMEH, NIZAMI'S KHOSROW & SHIRIN AND ODES OF SHAMS
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrary to the traditional rhetoricians who considered metaphor to be limited to literary text used as a mean for decoration of the speech, contemporary theoreticians see metaphor as a linguistic-conceptual mean that man uses it for knowing the surrounding phenomena. According to this theory, many of the most fundamental abstract notions such as time, quantity, cause, goal and etc, become understandable for man by the assistance of metaphor. The present study uses a descriptive-analytic method to comparatively assay the conceptualizations of the organ-word "head" in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Odes of Shams and Nizami's Khosrow & Shirin, from a cognitive perspective. This essay seeks to show the extent to which these poets have taken advantage of this key word in objectification of abstract concepts by means of conceptual metaphor. The research results show that the aforementioned poets despite their being under the influence of literary and linguistic traditions and the existing cultural roots sometimes have made use of the metaphors of similarity, they have been interested in a special group of abstract notions given the differences in thought and type of worldview and also their literary style and endeavored to conceptualize it by the aid of the organ-word of "head".

TI  - Accuracy of anthropometric measurements and weight status perceptions reported by parents of 4-year-old children
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the validity of self-reported height and weight by parents of 4-year-old children and subjective weight perception. Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting: Paediatric population living in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. Participants: Children born in 2008-2009 examined at 47-59 months of age. Data were collected by paediatricians of the Madrid Primary Care Physicians Sentinel Network. Parents reported weight and height data. Prevalence of weight status categories was calculated using WHO and International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) reference criteria. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were estimated. The appraisal of their child's weight perception and parental misperception were assessed. Results: For 2914 children, reported height was underestimated by -1 center dot 38 cm, weight by -0 center dot 25 kg and BMI was overestimated by +0 center dot 41 kg/m(2) on average. The prevalence of obesity estimated with reported data was 2 center dot 7 times higher than that calculated with measured data (16 center dot 2 v. 6 center dot 0 %) according to WHO classification, and 3 center dot 6 times higher with IOTF classification. Sensitivity to identify obesity was 70 center dot 5 %, specificity was 87 center dot 3 % and PPV was 26 center dot 2 % (WHO classification). Half of the parents of pre-schoolers with obesity failed to identify their child's weight status. Parental misperception among children classified as having overweight or obesity reached 93 center dot 0 and 58 center dot 8 %, respectively. Conclusions: Parents underestimated children's height and weight, leading to an overestimation of the prevalence of obesity. Small inaccuracies in reported measures have an important effect for the estimation of population prevalences. Parents' report of child weight status is unreliable. Parental awareness and acknowledgement of child weight status should be improved.

TI  - Is there an emerging left-wing foreign policy in the United States?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Is there a left-wing foreign policy emerging in the United States? The rise of an energized and assertive left wing of the Democratic Party, and a receptive constituency within the electorate, has opened space for new political possibilities at home. In the foreign policy realm, leftist internationalism is making compelling arguments about new directions. However, there are limitations to the possible realization of a left-wing foreign policy in the US. While candidates like Sanders and Warren are distinctive in a left-wing foreign policy worldview, the practical implications of their foreign policies are consistent with post-Cold War practice. There are two important exceptions: in trade policy and in their positions on the use of military force. Here they mark a sharp break from the liberal internationalist mainstream. This paper outlines five broad principles of left internationalism, assesses the foreign policy positions of leading Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination, and explores the long-term prospects of left-wing foreign policy in the US after 2020.

TI  - Pathology of sentinel lymph nodes: historical perspective and current applications in gynecologic cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Efforts to reduce surgical morbidity related to en bloc lymph node removal associated with cancer surgery led to the development of targeted lymph node sampling to identify the lymph node(s) most likely to harbor a metastasis. Through identification of one or only a few lymph nodes at highest risk, the overall number of lymph nodes removed could be markedly reduced. Submission of fewer lymph nodes affords more detailed pathologic examination than would otherwise be practical with a standard lymph node dissection. Such enhanced pathologic examination techniques (ie, ultra-staging) have contributed to increased detection of lymph node metastases, primarily by detection of low volume metastatic disease. Based on the success of sentinel lymph node mapping and ultra-staging in breast cancer and melanoma, such techniques are increasingly used for other organ systems including the gynecologic tract. This review addresses the historical aspects of sentinel lymph node evaluation and reviews current ultra-staging protocols as well as the implications associated with increased detection of low volume metastases.

TI  - Urban growth modeling using cellular automata model and AHP (case study: Qazvin city)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irregular growth in the surrounding lands is one of the most important issues for the city managers and programmers at various levels. Whereas nowadays study the process of land use changes to urban use plays the main role in long time decisions and programs, predicting the process of city growth and its modeling in future with precise methods for management and urban expansion control will be necessary more than other times. One of urban growth modeling is cellular automata model. This model has been used widely in urban studies because of its dynamic nature, ability of Integration with other models, ability to modify the model and required data availability. In this article, to maximize the efficiency of the cellular automata model and its constraints, the integration of the AHP automated cell model and cellular automata model have been used; and its accuracy has been evaluated. This article has been practical because its related principles has been collected in a documentary manner and has been used to analyses the issue in comparative and quantitative methods. Initially, the unplanned growth of Qazvin city has been investigated by Holdern and Shannon model. Then main parameters including distance from roads, land prices, distance from faults, distance from the rivers, soil gender, slope, permission to build land, topography, landscape, view to gardens and forest park as parameters involved in the development of Qazvin city are considered. The input data used in this research are Landsat tm and DEM images of the city of Qazvin in 1996 and 2016. Also, to evaluate the correctness of the model responses, the map of the developed regions in 2016 and the Kappa coefficient have been used. The Kappa coefficient is 92.3%, which is considered significant and appropriate and gave the fact that the Kappa number is acceptable. The Qazvin simulation was made in 2026. The results show that the proposed integrated model is suitable for studying urban growth.

TI  - A simple method for water balance estimation based on the empirical method and remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimates
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing a methodology for water balance estimation is a significant challenge, especially in areas with little or no gauging. This is because direct measurements of all the water balance components are not feasible. To overcome this issue, we propose a simple methodology based on the predefined empirical relationship between remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET), i.e. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET and groundwater recharge (GR), and readily available precipitation data at the monthly time step. The developed methodology was applied in seven catchments in NE Greece using time series of precipitation and remotely sensed ET from 2009 to 2019. The potential of the proposed method to accurately estimate the water balance was assessed by the comparison of the individual water balance components against modeled values. Three performance metrics were examined and indicated that the methodology produces a satisfactory outcome. Our results indicated mean ET accounting for approximately 54% of precipitation, mean GR of 24% and mean surface runoff approximately 22% of precipitation in the study area. The proposed approach was implemented using freely available remotely sensed products and the free R software for statistical computing and graphics, offering thus a convenient and inexpensive alternative for water balance estimation, even for basins with limited data availability.

TI  - Standard ultra-staging compared to one-step nucleic acid amplification for the detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer patients: a retrospective cohort comparison
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe objective of this study was to compared standard ultra-staging (SU) with one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for the detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in women with apparent uterine-confined endometrial cancer.MethodsAll women underwent SLN identification with complete surgical staging. All SLNs were cut perpendicular to the long axis and two adjacent 5 mu m sections were cut at each of two levels 50 mu m apart. At each level, one slide was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the other with immunohistochemistry using the AE1/AE3 anti-cytokeratin antibody, as well as one negative control slide for a total of five slides per block. For OSNA analysis, the 2 mm sections of the lymph nodes were homogenized to form a lysate. The lysate was then centrifuged and inserted into the RD 100i instrument where the isothermal amplification of CK19 mRNA was executed.ResultsOf the 396 patients included in the retrospective analysis, 214 were in the SU group, and 182 in the OSNA group. Overall 869 SLNs were identified (490 SU, 379 OSNA). Sixty patients exhibited SLN metastasis (34 SU, 26 OSNA). Macrometastasis, micrometastases, and isolated tumor cells (ITC) were 5.1%, 4.1%, and 0.2%, respectively, in the US group, and 2.4%, 6.3%, and 0.1%, respectively, in the OSNA group (p=0.022).ConclusionsThe OSNA assay detected a higher rate of micrometastasis and a lower rate of macrometastasis and ITC when compared with SU. The clinical and prognostic impact of ITC is debatable and controversial. Further studies are needed to clarify the respective roles of the OSNA and SU methods, and the possible role of ITC in the prognosis of patients with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer.

TI  - Street tree health from space? An evaluation using WorldView-3 data and the Washington DC Street Tree Spatial Database
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially accurate and timely information on tree health is an essential component of maintaining sustainability in a species-rich urban setting. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite images from June 11th, July 30th and August 30th, 2017 to detect field-measured health condition classes of 2308 trees within the District of Columbia Department of Transportation's Street Tree Spatial Database. For each street tree in each image, we measured six vegetation indices (VIs), and find that NDVI1 (defined as the normalized ratio of the red and the first of the near infrared bands) on the July image shows the strongest statistical difference among the VI values of trees classified in the field during 2017 as in good, fair, or poor health condition. This result confirms that high spatial resolution remote sensing images provided the opportunity for a timely tree health assessment at individual tree crown level. Notably, the variability in VI attributable to health condition classes is smaller than the large declines in VIs between the June and August image dates. This greendown phenological pattern occurs similarly for trees in all health condition classes, and is thus an essential consideration when comparing VIs from different years or months for tree health assessment. The tree health condition discrimination was overwhelmed by this greendown phenology and the spectral variability in these species-rich urban settings. Based on these findings, we propose useful strategies of using these high-resolution WV-3 data for street tree health management in other cities.

TI  - Radiometric Cross Calibration and Validation Using 4 Angle BRDF Model between Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work describes a proposed radiometric cross calibration between the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel 2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensors. The cross-calibration procedure involves (i) correction of the MSI data to account for spectral band differences with OLI and (ii) normalization of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effects in the data from both sensors using a new model accounting for the view zenith/azimuth angles in addition to the solar zenith/view angles. Following application of the spectral and BRDF normalization, standard least-squares linear regression is used to determine the cross-calibration gain and offset in each band. Uncertainties related to each step in the proposed process are determined, as is the overall uncertainty associated with the complete processing sequence. Validation of the proposed cross-calibration gains and offsets is performed on image data acquired over the Algodones Dunes site. The results of this work indicate that the blue band has the most significant offset, requiring use of the estimated cross-calibration offset in addition to the estimated gain. The highest difference was observed in the blue and red bands, which are 2.6% and 1.4%, respectively, while other bands shows no significant difference. Overall, the net uncertainty in the proposed process was estimated to be on the order of 6.76%, with the largest uncertainty component due to each sensor's calibration uncertainty on the order of 5% and 3% for the MSI and OLI, respectively. Other significant contributions to the uncertainty include seasonal changes in solar zenith and azimuth angles, target site nonuniformity, variability in atmospheric water vapor, and/or aerosol concentration.

TI  - Seasonality and risk factors for myxomatosis in pet rabbits in Great Britain
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Myxomatosis is a highly contagious, frequently fatal viral disease affecting both wild and domesticated European rabbits across many areas of the world. Here we used electronic health records (EHRs) collected from pet rabbits attending a sentinel voluntary network of 191 veterinary practices across Great Britain (GB) between March 2014 and June 2019 to identify new features of this disease's epidemiology. From a total of 89,408 rabbit consultations, text mining verified by domain experts identified 207 (0.23 %) cases where myxomatosis was the only differential diagnosis recorded by the attending practitioner. Cases occurred in all months but February and were distributed across the country. Consistent with studies in wild rabbits, the majority of cases occurred between August and November. However, there was also evidence for considerable variation between years. A nested case control study identified important risk factors for myxomatosis within this pet animal population including season, sex, age, vaccination status and distance to likely wild rabbit habitats. Female entire rabbits were twice as likely to be a case (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.26-3.13, p = 0.003), suggesting a novel role for behaviour in driving transmission from wild to domesticated rabbits. Vaccination had the largest protective effect with vaccinated rabbits being 8.3 times less likely to be a case than unvaccinated rabbits (OR = 0.12, 95 % CI 0.06-0.21, p = < 0.001).

TI  - The VIIRS-Based RST-FLARE Configuration: The Val d'Agri Oil Center Gas Flaring Investigation in Between 2015-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The RST (Robust Satellite Techniques)-FLARE algorithm is a satellite-based method using a multitemporal statistical analysis of nighttime infrared signals strictly related to industrial hotspots, such as gas flares. The algorithm was designed for both identifying and characterizing gas flares in terms of radiant/emissive power. The Val d'Agri Oil Center (COVA) is a gas and oil pre-treatment plant operating for about two decades within an anthropized area of Basilicata region (southern Italy) where it represents a significant potential source of social and environmental impacts. RST-FLARE, developed to study and monitor the gas flaring activity of this site by means of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, has exported VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) records by exploiting the improved spatial and spectral properties offered by this sensor. In this paper, the VIIRS-based configuration of RST-FLARE is presented and its application on the recent (2015-2019) gas flaring activity at COVA is analyzed and discussed. Its performance in gas flaring characterization is in good agreement with VIIRS Nightfire outputs to which RST-FLARE seems to provide some add-ons. The great consistency of radiant heat estimates computed with both RST-FLARE developed configurations allows proposing a multi-sensor RST-FLARE strategy for a more accurate multi-year analysis of gas flaring.

TI  - Endocrine therapy with or without whole breast irradiation in low-risk breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery: 10-year results of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group 8A trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To investigate long-term results of patients with hormonal receptor epositive breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and consecutive endocrine therapy (ET) with or without whole breast irradiation (WBI).Methods and materials: Within the 8 A trial of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group, a total of 869 patients received ET after BCS which was randomly followed by WBI (n = 439, group 1) or observation (n = 430, group 2). WBI was applied up to a mean total dosage of 50 Gy (+/- 10 Gy boost) in conventional fractionation.Results: After a median follow-up of 9.89 years, 10 in-breast recurrences (IBRs) were observed in group 1 and 31 in group 2, resulting in a 10-year local recurrenceefree survival (LRFS) of 97.5% and 92.4%, respectively (p = 0.004). This translated into significantly higher rates for disease-free survival (DFS): 94.5% group 1 vs 88.4% group 2, p = 0.0156. For distant metastasese free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS), respective 10-year rates amounted 96.7% and 86.6% for group 1 versus 96.4% and 87.6%, for group 2 (ns). WBI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, p < 0.01) and tumour grading (HR: 3.76, p = 0.03) were found as significant predictors for IBR in multiple cox regression analysis.Conclusions: After a median follow-up of 10 years, WBI resulted in a better local control and DFS compared with ET alone. The omission of WBI and tumour grading, respectively, were the only negative predictors for LRFS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Many Faces of Forgetting: Toward a Constructive View of Forgetting in Everyday Life
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN MEMORY AND COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forgetting is often considered a fundamental cognitive failure, reflecting the undesirable and potentially embarrassing inability to retrieve a sought-after experience or fact. For this reason, forgetfulness has been argued to form the basis of many problems associated with our memory system. We highlight instead how forgetfulness serves many purposes within our everyday experience, giving rise to some of our best characteristics. Drawing from cognitive, neuroscientific, and applied research, we contextualize our findings in terms of their contributions along three important (if not entirely independent) roles supported by forgetting, namely (a) the maintenance of a positive and coherent self-image ("Guardian"), (b) the facilitation of efficient cognitive function ("Librarian"), and (c) the development of a creative and flexible worldview ("Inventor"). Together, these roles depict an expanded understanding of how forgetting provides memory with many of its cardinal virtues.

TI  - The seasonal and annual impacts of landscape patterns on the urban thermal comfort using Landsat
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional in situ data based temperature-humidity indexes (THIs) have been widely used in the assessment of the quality of urban thermal environment, with the spatial details of thermal comfort currently unavailable. In this study, the THI is modified replacing the required in situ air temperature and relative humidity with remote sensing retrieved Land Surface Temperature and Normalized Difference Moisture Index, being the modified temperature-humidity index. The proposed remote sensing based index is then used to explore the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban thermal comfort, which are used to describe the urban thermal comfort grading in different seasons and the landscape metrics as well as to investigate the response of urban thermal comfort to landscape patterns seasonally and annually. The results show that at the macro scale, the impacts of landscape patterns on thermal comfort are the most important in summer with water bodies and built-up land being the most desirable and uncomfortable types, respectively. The opposite results are found in spring and winter despite the relatively less important effect in winter. At the micro scale, the variance contribution rate of the Percentage of Landscape to the MTHI is above 70%, and that of the Landscape Division Index and Aggregation Index is from 10% to 38.1%. It indicates that the composition of the landscape is the main factor affecting urban thermal comfort and is better than the landscape structure. The MTHI based on remote sensing data can monitor the spatial distribution of urban thermal comfort and is suitable to explain the reasons for the thermal comfort temporal variations.

TI  - Can Landsat-Derived Variables Related to Energy Balance Improve Understanding of Burn Severity From Current Operational Techniques?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest managers rely on accurate burn severity estimates to evaluate post-fire damage and to establish revegetation policies. Burn severity estimates based on reflective data acquired from sensors onboard satellites are increasingly complementing field-based ones. However, fire not only induces changes in reflected and emitted radiation measured by the sensor, but also on energy balance. Evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST) and land surface albedo (LSA) are greatly affected by wildfires. In this study, we examine the usefulness of these elements of energy balance as indicators of burn severity and compare the accuracy of burn severity estimates based on them to the accuracy of widely used approaches based on spectral indexes. We studied a mega-fire (more than 450 km(2) burned) in Central Portugal, which occurred from 17 to 24 June 2017. The official burn severity map acted as a ground reference. Variations induced by fire during the first year following the fire event were evaluated through changes in ET, LST and LSA derived from Landsat data and related to burn severity. Fisher's least significant difference test (ANOVA) revealed that ET and LST images could discriminate three burn severity levels with statistical significance (uni-temporal and multi-temporal approaches). Burn severity was estimated from ET, LST and LSA using thresholding. Accuracy of ET and LST based on burn severity estimates was adequate (kappa = 0.63 and 0.57, respectively), similar to the accuracy of the estimate based on dNBR (kappa = 0.66). We conclude that Landsat-derived surface energy balance variables, in particular ET and LST, in addition to acting as useful indicators of burn severity for mega-fires in Mediterranean ecosystems, may provide critical information about how energy balance changes due to fire.

TI  - A Synergetic Approach to Burned Area Mapping Using Maximum Entropy Modeling Trained with Hyperspectral Data and VIIRS Hotspots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern European countries, particularly Spain, are greatly affected by forest fires each year. Quantification of burned area is essential to assess wildfire consequences (both ecological and socioeconomic) and to support decision making in land management. Our study proposed a new synergetic approach based on hotspots and reflectance data to map burned areas from remote sensing data in Mediterranean countries. It was based on a widely used species distribution modeling algorithm, in particular the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) one-class classifier. Additionally, MaxEnt identifies variables with the highest contribution to the final model. MaxEnt was trained with hyperspectral indexes (from Earth-Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion data) and hotspot information (from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Near Real-Time 375 m active fire product). Official fire perimeter measurements by Global Positioning System acted as a ground reference. A highly accurate burned area estimation (overall accuracy = 0.99%) was obtained, and the indexes which most contributed to identifying burned areas included Simple Ratio (SR), Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI750), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). We concluded that the presented methodology enables accurate burned area mapping in Mediterranean ecosystems and may easily be automated and generalized to other ecosystems and satellite sensors.

TI  - Assessment of RGB Vegetation Indices to Estimate Chlorophyll Content in Sugar Beet Leaves in the Final Cultivation Stage
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of chlorophyll content with portable meters is an easy way to quantify crop nitrogen status in sugar beet leaves. In this work, an alternative for chlorophyll content estimation using RGB-only vegetation indices has been explored. In a first step, pictures of spring-sown 'Fernanda KWS' variety sugar beet leaves taken with a commercial camera were used to calculate 25 RGB indices reported in the literature and to obtain 9 new indices through principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise linear regression (SLR) techniques. The performance of the 34 indices was examined in order to evaluate their ability to estimate chlorophyll content and chlorophyll degradation in the leaves under different natural light conditions along 4 days of the canopy senescence period. Two of the new proposed RGB indices were found to improve the already good performance of the indices reported in the literature, particularly for leaves featuring low chlorophyll contents. The 4 best indices were finally tested in field conditions, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-taken photographs of a sugar beet plot, finding a reasonably good agreement with chlorophyll-meter data for all indices, in particular for I-2 and (R-B)/(R+G+B). Consequently, the suggested RGB indices may hold promise for inexpensive chlorophyll estimation in sugar beet leaves during the harvest time, although a direct relationship with nitrogen status still needs to be validated.

TI  - Combined Use of Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Images for Wheat Yield Estimates at the Intra-Plot Spatial Scale
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to address the capabilities of multi-temporal optical images to estimate the fine-scale yield variability of wheat, over a study site located in southwestern France. The methodology is based on the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images acquired after the sowing and before the harvest of the crop throughout four successive agricultural seasons, the reflectance constituting the input variables of a statistical algorithm (random forest). The best performances are obtained when the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is combined with the yield maps collected during the crop rotation, the agricultural season 2014 showing the lower level of performances with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.44 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.13 quintals by hectare (q.h(-1)) (corresponding to a relative error of 12.9%), the three other years being associated with values of R-2 close or upper to 0.60 and RMSE lower than 7 q.h(-1) (corresponding to a relative error inferior to 11.3%). Moreover, the proposed approach allows estimating the crop yield throughout the agricultural season, by using the successive images acquired from the sowing to the harvest. In such cases, early and accurate yield estimates are obtained three months before the end of the crop cycle. At this phenological stage, only a slight decrease in performance is observed compared to the statistic obtained just before the harvest.

TI  - Control of wind-wave power on morphological shape of salt marsh margins
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are among the most common morphological features found in tidal landscapes and provide ecosystem services of primary ecological and economic importance. However, the continued rise in relative sea level and increasing anthropogenic pressures threaten the sustainability of these environments. The alarmingly high rates of salt marsh loss observed worldwide, mainly dictated by the lateral erosion of their margins, call for new insights into the mutual feedbacks among physical, biological, and morphological processes that take place at the critical interface between salt marshes and the adjoining tidal flats. We combined field measurements, remote sensing data, and numerical modeling to investigate the interplays between wind waves and the morphology, ecology, and planform evolution of salt marsh margins in the Venice Lagoon of Italy. Our results confirm the existence of a positive linear relationship between incoming wave power density and rates of salt marsh lateral retreat. In addition, we show that lateral erosion significantly decreases when halophytic vegetation colonizes the marsh margins, and that different erosion rates in vegetated margins are associated with different halophytes. High marsh cliffs and smooth shorelines are expected along rapidly eroding margins, whereas erosion rates are reduced in gently sloped, irregular edges facing shallow tidal flats that are typically exposed to low wind-energy conditions. By highlighting the relationships between the dynamics and functional forms of salt marsh margins, our results represent a critical step to address issues related to conservation and restoration of salt marsh ecosystems, especially in the face of changing environmental forcings.

TI  - Explosive exhalations by common bottlenose dolphins during <i>Karenia brevis</i> red tides
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) such as those produced by Karenia brevis have acute negative impacts on common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Florida coastal waters, frequently causing illness and death. However, much less is known about chronic, sub-acute effects on these important sentinel species. This study investigates whether bottlenose dolphin behavior in Sarasota Bay, Florida is influenced by the presence of severe red tide events, focusing on respiratory and other behaviors likely affected by abundant toxin aerosols produced during these blooms. Through focal animal behavioral follows, we observed free-ranging dolphin respiratory behavior, activity budgets, and movement patterns relative to K. brevis abundance in the study area. We compared behavior from dolphins observed during a 2005 K. brevis bloom to those observed during inter-bloom conditions where K. brevis was present at background concentrations. We found that the rate of "chuffing", an explosive type of exhalation, was significantly greater in dolphins observed during the bloom. No apparent effect on respiratory rate, heading change rate or activity budgets was observed. We propose that this chuffing behavior is analogous to symptoms of respiratory irritation observed in humans exposed to such red tide events, and suggest that this may be a type of disturbance response. With an observed increase in both the frequency and severity of HABs, such disturbance responses may have large-scale chronic impacts to the health and fitness of bottlenose dolphins in regions where such HABs are common.

TI  - Comparison of Upper Extremity Function in Women With and Women Without a History of Breast Cancer
T2  - PHYSICAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Breast cancer treatments often result in upper extremity functional limitations in both the short and long term. Current evidence makes comparisons against a baseline or contralateral limb, but does not consider changes in function associated with aging.Objective. The objective of this study was to compare upper extremity function between women treated for breast cancer more than 12 months in the past and women without cancer.Design. This was an observational cross-sectional study.Methods. Women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mean post-surgical treatment time of 51 months (range = 12-336 months) were compared with women who did not have breast cancer (CTRL group). Self-reported upper extremity function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and shoulder range of motion, strength, and muscular endurance were measured. Participants were divided into 3 groups: breast cancer involving the nondominant limb (BC-ND), breast cancer involving the dominant limb (BC-DOM), and CTRL.Results. A total of 59 women in the CTRL group, 23 women in the BC-ND group, and 28 women in the BC-DOM group completed measures. Mean DASH scores in women with breast cancer were higher than those of women in the CTRL group, regardless of the limb on which cancer occurred (Cohen d = 1.13; 95% CI = 2.20 to 16.21) Range of motion for the BC-ND group was significantly less for flexion (Cohen d = 1.19, 95% CI = -13.08 to -0.11) and external rotation (Cohen d = 1.11, 95% CI = -18.62 to -1.98) compared with the CTRL group. Strength in the BC-ND group was 23% to 25% lower in the CTRL group for external (Cohen's d = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.12) and internal rotation (Cohen d = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.13). Endurance was not significantly different in the 3 groups.Limitations. Some participants had rehabilitation, which may have skewed results. The range of post-surgical treatment times was broad, making it difficult to determine when function returned. Muscular endurance measures demonstrated a ceiling effect and large variance, limiting the ability to distinguish differences among participants. These results may not be generalizable to the subset of women who were treated with lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, or chest wall radiation alone or who underwent a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.Conclusion. In the long term, women with breast cancer have lower self-reported shoulder function than women without breast cancer. Motion and strength are lower among women who have experienced cancer on the nondominant limb.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Small-Scale Mining Activities in Ghana using Sentinel-1 Time Series (2015-2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal small-scale mining (galamsey) in South-Western Ghana has grown tremendously in the last decade and caused significant environmental degradation. Excessive cloud cover in the area has limited the use of optical remote sensing data to map and monitor the extent of these activities. This study investigated the use of annual time-series Sentinel-1 data to map and monitor illegal mining activities along major rivers in South-Western Ghana between 2015 and 2019. A change detection approach, based on three time-series features-minimum, mean, maximum-was used to compute a backscatter threshold value suitable to identify/detect mining-induced land cover changes in the study area. Compared to the mean and maximum, the minimum time-series feature (in both VH and VV polarization) was found to be more sensitive to changes in backscattering within the period of investigation. Our approach permitted the detection of new illegal mining areas on an annual basis. A backscatter threshold value of +1.65 dB was found suitable for detecting illegal mining activities in the study area. Application of this threshold revealed illegal mining area extents of 102 km(2), 60 km(2) and 33 km(2) for periods 2015/2016-2016/2017, 2016/2017-2017/2018 and 2017/2018-2018/2019, respectively. The observed decreasing trend in new illegal mining areas suggests that efforts at stopping illegal mining yielded positive results in the period investigated. Despite the advantages of Synthetic Aperture Radar data in monitoring phenomena in cloud-prone areas, our analysis revealed that about 25% of the Sentinel-1 data, mostly acquired in March and October (beginning and end of rainy season respectively), were unusable due to atmospheric effects from high intensity rainfall events. Further investigation in other geographies and climatic regions is needed to ascertain the susceptibility of Sentinel-1 data to atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Multi-sensor detection of forest-cover change across 45 years in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing march toward freely available, highly pre-processed satellite imagery has given both researchers and the public unprecedented access to a vast and varied data stream teeming with potential. Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change.With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 13 space-borne imagers capturing 140 images spanning 45 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change-both deforestation and regrowth-at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat's. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings. The BULC approach leverages the many successes of single-sensor research and can be used as a straightforward, complementary tool for blending many good-quality mapped classifications from disparate sources into a coherent, high-quality time series.

TI  - Estimating 500-m Resolution Soil Moisture Using Sentinel-1 and Optical Data Synergy
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to estimate surface soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of at least 6 days, by combining remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and optical data from Sentinel-2 and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The proposed methodology is based on the change detection technique, applied to a series of measurements over a three-year period (2015 to 2018). The algorithm described here as "Soil Moisture Estimations from the Synergy of Sentinel-1 and optical sensors (SMES)" proposes different options, allowing information from vegetation densities and seasonal conditions to be taken into account. The output from this algorithm is a moisture index ranging between 0 and 1, with 0 corresponding to the driest soils and 1 to the wettest soils. This methodology has been tested at different test sites (South of France, Central Tunisia, Western Benin and Southwestern Niger), characterized by a wide range of different climatic conditions. The resulting surface soil moisture estimations are compared with in situ measurements and already existing satellite-derived soil moisture ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) products. They are found to be well correlated, for the African regions in particular (RMSE below 6 vol.%). This outcome indicates that the proposed algorithm can be used with confidence to estimate the surface soil moisture of a wide range of climatically different sites.

TI  - Sentinel node total tumour load as a predictive factor for non-sentinel node status in early breast cancer patients - The porttle study
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - OSNA is a molecular assay for the detection of sentinel node metastasis. TTL emerged as a concept that seems to accurately predict the status of the NSN. Authors tried to confirm this motion.This is a retrospective and multicentric study that analyzed 2164 patients, 579 of whom had positive SN and completion AD. Logistic regression models were performed in order to identify a suitable cutoff to identify patients who benefit from AD.Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed a relationship between TTL>30000 and the presence of NSN metastasis (OR 2.84, CI 1.99-4.08, p < 0.001). Logistic regression indicated that the cutoff of 30000 copies/mu L better discriminates patients with NSN positivity and allows wide use of these criteria.This cutoff value may safely assist clinicians and patients to decide to proceed or not with an AD.

TI  - Remote sensing-guided stratigraphic dissection of an Ediacaran terrestrial molasse basin (Kareim basin, Egypt), with implications for sedimentary evolution
T2  - PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kareim basin in the Central Eastern Desert is one of the largest Ediacaran post-amalgamation (Hammamat) basins in Egypt. It formed at a time of extensional tectonism (600 +/- 20 Ma) in the northern Arabian-Nubian Shield. The Kareim basin preserves a similar to 6500 m fill of rapidly deposited alluvial fan and lake sediments. Due to monotonous lithology and complex facies variations the stratigraphic architecture of this and other large Hammamat basins is poorly known. In this study, LANDSAT 8 (OLI) data for the Kareim was processed to provide best band ratio and PCA images that allow tracing of sandstone-dominant and conglomerate-dominant packages, revealing a configuration of eight new stratigraphic units (Units 1-8). Units 1-3 are basinwide, while Units 4-8 are localized and partly bounded by intraformational angular unconformities that formed during syn-sedimentary tectonism. Fan palaeoslopes and palaeocurrents were W-directed in Units 1-3, then switched to SW- and S-directed in later units, implying that the provenance areas lay east and north of the basin, not south as in previous basin evolutionary models. This study provides the first RS-guided stratigraphic dissection of a Hammamat basin, and provides a sensitive tool for detecting intraformational unconformities in basins filled with monotonous molasse sequences. It paves the way for the sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Egyptian Hammamat basins.

TI  - Analysis of the Transport of Aerosols over the North Tropical Atlantic Ocean Using Time Series of POLDER/PARASOL Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The time series of total, fine and coarse POLAC/PARASOL aerosol optical depth (AOD) satellite products (2005-2013) processed by the POLAC algorithm are examined to investigate the transport of aerosols over the North Tropical Atlantic Ocean, a region that is characterized by significant dust aerosols events. First, the comparison of satellite observations with ground-based measurements acquired by AERONET ground-based measurements shows a satisfactory consistency for both total AOD and coarse mode AOD (i.e., correlation coefficients of 0.75 and bias ranging from -0.03 to 0.03), thus confirming the robustness and performance of POLAC/PARASOL data to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of the aerosols over the study area. Regarding fine mode aerosol, POLAC/PARASOL data present a lower performance with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.37 to 0.73. Second, the analysis of POLAC/PARASOL aerosol climatology reveals a high contribution of the coarse mode of aerosols (AODc between 0.1 and 0.4) at long distance from the African sources, confirming previous studies related to dust transport. The POLAC/PARASOL data were also compared with aerosol data obtained over the North Tropical Atlantic Ocean from MACC and MERRA-2 reanalyses. It is observed that the total AOD is underestimated in both reanalysis with a negative bias reaching -0.2. In summary, our results thus suggest that satellite POLAC/PARASOL observations of fine and coarse modes of aerosols could provide additional constraints useful to improve the quantification of the dust direct radiative forcing on a regional scale but also the biogeochemical processes such as nutrient supply to the surface waters.

TI  - Using local climate zones to compare remotely sensed surface temperatures in temperate cities and hot desert cities
T2  - MORAVIAN GEOGRAPHICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban and rural thermal properties mainly depend on surface cover features as well as vegetation cover. Surface classification using the local climate zone (LCZ) system provides an appropriate approach for distinguishing urban and rural areas, as well as comparing the surface urban heat island (SUHI) of climatically different regions. Our goal is to compare the SUHI effects of two Central European cities (Szeged, Hungary and Novi Sad, Serbia) with a temperate climate (Koppen-Geiger's Cfa), and a city (Beer Sheva, Israel) with a hot desert (BWh) climate. LCZ classification is completed using WUDAPT (World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools) methodology and the thermal differences are analysed on the basis of the land surface temperature data of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor, derived on clear days over a four-year period. This intra-climate region comparison shows the difference between the SUHI effects of Szeged and Novi Sad in spring and autumn. As the pattern of NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) indicates, the vegetation coverage of the surrounding rural areas is an important modifying factor of the diurnal SUHI effect, and can change the sign of the urban-rural thermal difference. According to the inter-climate comparison, the urban-rural thermal (wardst is the strongest during daytime in summer with an opposite sign in each season.

TI  - Mitigating MODIS AOD non-random sampling error on surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimates by a combined use of Bayesian Maximum Entropy method and linear mixed-effects model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 estimates solely based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products may lead to a substantial bias because of non-random AOD sampling deficiency in cloudy conditions and swap-gap regions. Furthermore, this non-random sampling issue can be exacerbated in polluted regions where heavy aerosol loadings are likely misclassified into clouds. Here, to mitigate non-random sampling deficiency in MODIS AOD product for surface-level PM2.5 estimates, we have combined Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method with the Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) model, for the first time, to produce more spatiotemporally complete and precise AOD products and thereafter PM2.5 estimates. This combined BME-LME approach was applied to MODIS and sunphotometer AOD products over the North China Plain. Relative to the standard MODIS AOD product, the integration of MODIS and sunphotometer AOD through BME showed increases in both spatiotemporal completeness (up to 96%) and the quality. The resultant monthly PM2.5 estimates from the BME-LME had a bias of 3.5 mu g m(-3) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.5 mu g m(-3), showing substantial improvement over PM2.5 estimations from original MODIS AOD product (a bias of 84.1 and a RMSE of 112.1 mu g m(-3)). Merging sunphotomter and satellite AOD observations with BME-LME is a prospective method to simultaneously improve AOD and PM2.5 estimates.

TI  - DELUSION, REALITY, AND INTERSUBJECTIVITY <i>A Phenomenological and Enactive Analysis</i>
T2  - PHILOSOPHY PSYCHIATRY & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to current representationalist concepts, delusion is considered the result of faulty information processing or incorrect inference about external reality. In contrast, the article develops a concept of delusion as a disturbance of the enactive and intersubjective constitution of a shared reality. A foundation of this concept is provided by a theory of the objectivity of perception, which is achieved on two levels: 1) On the first level, the sensorimotor interaction with the environment implies a mobility and multiplicity of perspectives that relativizes the momentary point of view. 2) On the second level, the social interaction with others implies a virtual shifting and contrast of perspectives which helps to overcome a merely subject-centered worldview through participatory sense-making. On this basis, the alteration of experience in beginning psychosis is phenomenologically described as a subjectivization of perception, resulting in an overall experience of self-centrality and derealization. Delusion then converts the disturbance of perception into a reframing of the perceived world, namely an assumed persecution by mundane enemies. Through this, a new sense-making is established, yet in a way that is fundamentally decoupled from the shared world. The possibility of intersubjective understanding is thus sacrificed for the new coherence of the delusion. Further implications of the loss of the intersubjective co-constitution of reality are analyzed, in particular related to disturbances of communication.

TI  - Optical Design of COLIBRI: A Fast Follow-up Telescope for Transient Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - COLIBRI will be a Franco-Mexican 1.3-m telescope and imager for observing the visible and near infrared counterparts of transient events detected by the future SVOM mission. The imager is divided into two instruments: DDRAGO, with two 4k x 4k CCDs observing in gri and zy, respectively, and CAGIRE, with one 2k x 2k LYNRED or H2RG detector observing in JH. DDRAGO will directly image the telescope focal plane with a field of view (FoV) of 26 x 26 arcmin. CAGIRE will reimage the focal plane to make a pupil image available for a cold stop and adjust the plate scale to deliver a similar FoV. CAGIRE will not use a conventional collimator-camera configuration but rather an arrangement of lenses that sends the pupil image close to the focal plane after all of the reimaging optics. This allows most of the optics, including the infrared filters, to be at ambient temperature and avoids the complexity of having mechanisms and powered optics within the cryostat (CR). We present here the optical design of the system and a thorough analysis on the expected image quality of the instruments and the telescope.

TI  - Quality Assessment of PROBA-V LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER Collection 300 m Products of Copernicus Global Land Service
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) provides global time series of leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and fraction of vegetation cover (fCOVER) data at a resolution of 300 m and a frequency of 10 days. We performed a quality assessment and validation of Version 1 Collection 300 m products that were consistent with the guidelines of the Land Product Validation (LPV) subgroup of the Committee on Earth Observation System (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV). The spatiotemporal patterns of Collection 300 m V1 LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER products are consistent with CGLS Collection 1 km V1, Collection 1 km V2 and Moderate Resolution Imagery Spectroradiometer Collection 6 (MODIS C6) products. The Collection 300 m V1 products have good precision and smooth temporal profiles, and the interannual variations are consistent with similar satellite products. The accuracy assessment using ground measurements mainly over crops shows an overall root mean square deviation of 1.01 (44.3%) for LAI, 0.12 (22.2%) for fAPAR and 0.21 (42.6%) for fCOVER, with positive mean biases of 0.36 (15.5%), 0.05 (10.3%) and 0.16 (32.2%), respectively. The products meet the CGLS user accuracy requirements in 69.1%, 62.5% and 29.7% of the cases for LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER, respectively. The CGLS will continue the production of Collection 300 m V1 LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER beyond the end of the PROBA-V mission by using Sentinel-3 OLCI as input data.

TI  - Multi-scale selection models predict breeding habitat for two Arctic-breeding raptor species
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Raptors are important environmental indicators because they are apex predators and can be sensitive to disturbance. Few studies have addressed habitat preferences of tundra-nesting raptors, and those that exist have focused on fine-scale characteristics. With increasing economic development predicted to occur throughout the Canadian Arctic, the investigation of raptor breeding habitat at broad spatial scales is required. We modeled breeding habitat selection for two raptor species on north Baffin Island, NU, Canada. During aerial surveys conducted over six breeding seasons, we documented 172 peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius) and 160 rough-legged hawk (Buteo lagopus) nesting sites. We used these locations in conjunction with remote sensing data to build habitat selection models at three spatial scales. Topography, distance to water, and normalized 8 difference vegetation index explained selection at all scales; slope aspect was also important o at the finest scale. To validate landscape scale models, we conducted a validation survey that resulted in the detection of 45 new nests (peregrine falcon n = 21, rough-legged hawk n = 24). We did not detect any new nests in areas where model-predicted occurrence was expected to be low. Conversely, we found more than half of previously undetected nests in e , o areas where model-predicted occurrence was expected to be high.

TI  - The Idea of the Anavatapta Lake in India and Its Adoption in East Asia
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article centers around the Anavatapta Lake. In East Asian pictorialization of worldview, Maps of Mt. Sumeru, which depict the mountain at the core of the world, are often paired with Maps of India, in which the Anavatapta Lake occupies a significant place. When the concept of the Anavatapta Lake was transmitted from India to China and Japan, it was understood through the lens of local cultures and ideologies, and the lake was envisioned as a site spatially connected to various places in China and Japan. As a result, the idea of the Indian lake located at the center of the human world helped China and Japan formulate their statuses and positions within the religious and geopolitical discourse of Buddhist cosmology. Through investigations of both pictorial and textual sources, this article explores the significance and place that the Anavatapta Lake occupied in East Asian religion and literature.

TI  - Can we save a marine species affected by a highly infective, highly lethal, waterborne disease from extinction?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Anthropogenic drivers and global warming are altering the occurrence of infectious marine diseases, some of which produce mass mortalities with considerable ecosystemic and economic costs. The Mediterranean Sea is considered a laboratory to examine global processes, and the fan mussel Pinna nobilis a sentinel species within it. Since September 2016, fan mussels suffer a die-off, very likely provoked by the protozoan Haplosporidium pinnae. Population dynamic surveys, rescue programmes, larvae collector installation and protection of infected adults from predators, have increased knowledge about the factors conditioning the spread of the die-off; previous model simulations indicate that water temperature and salinity seem to be related to the manifestation of the disease, which at the end are strongly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic actions. The absence of natural recruitment implies that fan mussel populations are not recovering, but the survival of populations living in paralic environments provides an opportunity to study the disease and its conditioning factors. The fan mussel disease outbreak provides a case example for how climate change may mediate host-protozoan dynamics and poses several questions: are we witnessing the potential extinction of a sentinel species? Can we avoid it by applying active measures? If so, which measures will be more effective? How many other more overlooked species might experience a massive and unnoticed die-off before it is too late to implement any preservation action? This is especially relevant because the loss of keystone species can drive to community effects that influence marine ecosystem processes.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Study of the issue of interaction of literatures and clarification of their mutual enrichment patterns are among the most important tasks of comparati vistics. The reception is carried out through creative rethinking and "adoption" of the achievements of foreign literatures. Azerbaijani literature has risen to a new level of artistic development thanks to creative mastery of Russian culture traditions. Drawing upon the vast and diverse heritage of Russian classics, Azerbaijanian writers found certain aspects and elements consonant with the problems of modern times and instrumental when solving their creative tasks. By learning from the experience of Russian literature and synthesizing it, they expanded artistic horizons (in terms of style, genre, issues) while relying on their own literary traditions. The subject of paper is determined by the need of studying the originality of Azerbaijani reception of Tolstoy' s heritage and thus of contributing to a fuller picture of perception and functioning of his works in a foreign literary context and cultural environment. The study highlights Tolstoy's role in development of the national prose, for instance, Azerbaijani novel, and reveals his influence on the worldview and creative attitudes of novelists. Tolstoy's traditions, methods and principles found their artistic interpretations within the national - epic, historical, social and psychological and philosophical - novel (Yu. Chemenzeminli, M. Ordubadi, S. Ragimov, M. Guseyn, M. Jalal, Abulgasan, M. Ibragimov and others). Exploring of inexhaustible source of the Russian classic' s heritage enriched the Azerbaijani prose with the new ideas and images. Present research promotes deeper understanding of reception of the Russian writer' s works by the Azerbaijani art consciousness and expands our perceptions about cross-cultural art dialogue.

TI  - A Learning-Enhanced Two-Pair Spatiotemporal Reflectance Fusion Model for GF-2 and GF-1 WFV Satellite Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since requirements of related applications for time series remotely-sensed images with high spatial resolution have been hard to be satisfied under current observation conditions of satellite sensors, it is key to reconstruct high-resolution images at specified dates. As an effective data reconstruction technique, spatiotemporal fusion can be used to generate time series land surface parameters with a clear geophysical significance. In this study, an improved fusion model based on the Sparse Representation-Based Spatiotemporal Reflectance Fusion Model (SPSTFM) is developed and assessed with reflectance data from Gaofen-2 Multi-Spectral (GF-2 MS) and Gaofen-1 Wide-Field-View (GF-1 WFV). By introducing a spatially enhanced training method to dictionary training and sparse coding processes, the developed fusion framework is expected to promote the description of high-resolution and low-resolution overcomplete dictionaries. Assessment indices including Average Absolute Deviation (AAD), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Correlation Coefficient (CC), spectral angle mapper (SAM), structure similarity (SSIM) and Erreur Relative Global Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS) are then used to test employed fusion methods for a parallel comparison. The experimental results show that more accurate prediction of GF-2 MS reflectance than that from the SPSTFM can be obtained and furthermore comparable with popular two-pair based reflectance fusion models like the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Fusion Model (STARFM) and the Enhanced-STARFM (ESTARFM).

TI  - Automatic Training Set Compilation With Multisource Geodata for DTM Generation From the TanDEM-X DSM
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The TanDEM-X mission (TDM) is a spaceborne radar interferometer which delivers a global digital surface model (DSM) with a spatial resolution of 0.4 arcsec. In this letter, we propose an automatic workflow for digital terrain model (DTM) generation from TDM DSM data through additional consideration of Sentinel-2 imagery and open-source geospatial vector data. The method includes the automatic and robust compilation of training samples by imposing dedicated criteria on the multisource geodata for subsequent learning of a classification model. The model is capable of supporting the accurate distinction of elevated objects (OBJ) and bare earth (BE) measurements in the TDM DSM. Finally, a DTM is interpolated from identified BE measurements. Experimental results obtained from a test site which covers a complex and heterogeneous built environment of Santiago de Chile, Chile, underline the usefulness of the proposed workflow, since it allows for substantially increased accuracies compared to a morphological filter-based method.

TI  - Cervical versus endometrial injection for sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer: a randomized clinical trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the relationship between pelvic/para-aortic sentinel lymph node status and two different injection sites of 99m-technetium (Tc-99m)-labeled phytate in patients with endometrial cancer.MethodsThis was a randomized controlled trial involving 81 patients with endometrial cancer. In the cervical group (n=40), injections of Tc-99m were performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions of the uterine cervix. In the endometrial group (n=41), Tc-99m was injected into the fundal endometrium using a transcervical catheter. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected through pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy and intra-operatively using a handheld gamma probe. All patients underwent complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy procedures. Pathologic ultra-staging was performed with immunostaining for cytokeratin in sentinel lymph nodes after routine hematoxylin and eosin histological examinations. The primary endpoint was the estimation of detection rates, sensitivity, false-negative rates, negative predictive value, and analysis of the distribution of pelvic and para-aortic sentinel lymph nodes.ResultsThe rate of detection of at least one sentinel lymph node, sensitivity, and the negative predictive value was 80%, 66.6%, 96.6% for the cervical group and 85%, 66.6%, 96.9% for the endometrial group, respectively. False-negative sentinel lymph nodes were detected in one patient from each group . There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of total sentinel lymph node count, sentinel pelvic lymph node count, and pelvic bilaterality, but the para-aortic sentinel lymph node count was significantly higher in the endometrial group (p<0.001). Ultra-staging examination of the pelvic sentinel lymph nodes revealed isolated tumor cells in one patient from each group.ConclusionTranscervical endometrial tracer injection in endometrial cancer revealed similar pelvic but significantly higher para-aortic sentinel lymph node detection.

M3  - Article
AB  - Besides histologic features, the presence of nodal metastasis is the most crucial prognostic factor for recurrence and survival for patients with gynecologic cancer. Conventionally, lymphadenectomy has been performed routinely to assess lymphatic metastasis. However, lymphadenectomy may be unnecessary in early-stage gynecologic cancer, because the percentage of patients with lymph node involvement is very low. The recent use of sentinel lymph node mapping has provided high feasibility, safety, and accuracy in the assessment of nodal metastasis. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines have incorporated the sentinel lymph node for nodal evaluation in vulvar, endometrial, and cervical cancers.

TI  - Modelling frost generates insights for managing risk of minimum temperature extremes
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Frosts and extreme minimum temperature events cause significant damage to grapevines. In the Victorian vine growing regions of Australia, these events may cause complete wipe-out of a season's grape production, and millions of dollars of losses. Frost is an important risk to be managed by viticulturalists, and is likely to change under future climatic conditions with impacts on existing wine-grape growing regions. This case-study applies high spatial resolution analysis of minimum night-time temperatures to explore the impact of current and future frost risks. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) are used to model high-resolution (30m grid) minimum temperatures for a topographically diverse region in the Yarra Valley wine region in southeastern Australia. Remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) night-time temperatures, elevation, terrain indices and meteorological station data were used to develop the model of minimum nighttime temperatures. The model is formally validated against independent vineyard minimum temperature records (R-2 = 0.68) as well as current distribution of viticulture land-use, which was compared with viticulturists' perceptions of a frost-line in the region. Historical temperature records were then adjusted to produce high-resolution maps of frost occurrence under a hot-dry future climate scenario, and a warm-wet scenario, for the years 2030 and 2050. All the future climate scenarios project down-elevation movement of the frost line of between 10m and 30m depending on scenarios. This work has implications for viticulturists who might plan to expand growing areas to lower elevations, or might consider changing to different grape varieties. The method developed here could be applied to other regions or used to explore other future climate scenarios.

TI  - Is Necessary Intraoprative Frozen Section In Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy For Breast Cancer Patients?
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvements in the process of staging and surgical treatment of axillary lymph nodes in recent years, have led to the use of intra operative frozen section pathology to examine the sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: we evaluated the results of the Sentinel biopsy in 102 patients with early stage breast cancer, which were negative clinical lymph nodes, and analyzing the true positive and false negative rate, diagnostic accuracy of frozen section lymph node biopsy. It also studied the factors affecting the sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes in patients treated by axillary lymph dissection.RESULTS: In this study, we investigated 102 patients' stage 1and 2 breast cancer with clinical negative axillary lymph node and candidates for sentinel lymph node biopsy, were placed under investigation. 15.7 % of the real positive results of sentinel and 62.7 % of the real negative and 2 % false positives and 20.9 % false negative results and% 78. 4 diagnostic accuracy, has been frozen section. Among the patients who were initially or delayed in the axillary dissection, 37% had more than two lymph nodes. While in general, 16.7% of patients had a need for axillary lymph node dissection based on z11 criteria. Lymph-vascular invasion was a major contributor to lentil involvement in Sentinel and non-Sentinel nodes.CONCLUSION: Frozen section pathology during the operation of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been initiated to prevent the need for a reoperation in early stage breast cancer patients. However, due to low tumor burden in patients who are candidates for this procedure, and the constraints in the initial sections and their false negative results, also the removal of frozen section will not have an effect on the rate of increasing reoperation and can be effective in reducing the time and cost of surgery.

TI  - Retrospective detection of isolated tumor cells by immunohistochemistry in sentinel lymph node biopsy performed for endometrial carcinoma: is there clinical significance?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSeveral studies have reported optimizing ultrastaging protocols using immunohistochemistry for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial carcinoma; however, the clinical significance of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) detected by ultrastaging is unknown. This study aimed to: (1) determine the frequency of retrospective ITC detection in patients with endometrial carcinoma and reported negative SLNs determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination only; and (2) determine the clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients with endometrial carcinoma and previously undetected ITCs.Methods474 SLNs from 155 patients with endometrial carcinoma and reported negative SLNs were subjected to an immunohistochemistry protocol which included staining slides with cytokeratin at 1, 10, 20, and 50 mu m levels, to examine for ITCs. Clinicopathological data of patients with ITCs detected by this method were analyzed to determine patient outcomes.ResultsUsing immunohistochemistry, ITCs were detected in 5.7% (27/474) of SLNs and 13.5% (21/155) of patients with previously reported negative SLNs. In this patient cohort, 95.2% (20/21) had endometrioid histology, with the remaining case being carcinosarcoma. 38.1% (8/21) received adjuvant therapy (either brachytherapy alone (4/8) or chemotherapy and radiation (4/8)) based on other parameters, while 61.9% (13/21) had no adjuvant therapy. Of the patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy, all had endometrioid histology and 84.6% (11/13) were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA. No patients (0/13) recurred after a median follow-up of 31.5 (range 2-84.4) months.DiscussionIn this study, 38.1% of patients with previously undetected ITCs had adjuvant treatment based on other high risk factors; as such, reporting ITCs would not have altered patient management for those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. To date, no patients with previously undetected ITCs without adjuvant treatment had a recurrence, suggesting that ITC detection may not be clinically relevant.

TI  - Satellite estimates of euphotic zone and Secchi disk depths in a colored dissolved organic matter-dominated inland water
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water transparency is an important parameter to water quality monitoring. To quantify the water transparency the attenuation coefficient, k(d), of the photosynthetically active radiation - PAR, k(d)(PAR), the euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) and the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) are used. There is no investigation using satellite data about the water transparency for inland waters dominated by the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), an optical significant substance (OSS) of dissolved organic matter and an important water quality indicator that affect the primary production, and its relation with Chl-a. Therefore, six models, among them empirical and semi-analytical, were evaluated for Z(eu) and one semi-analytical model was considered for Z(SD). The errors (unbiased absolute percentage error, epsilon - 30%) of empirical and semi-analytical models for Z(eu) estimations were similar; and an empirical model using k(d)(490) from Zhao et al. (2013) had the best performance (epsilon - 16%). The semi-analytical model from Lee et al. (2015) to estimate Z(SD) presented an error of 57%. The spatial distributions of Z(eu) and Z(SD) provided the observation of a seasonal pattern of water transparency parameters, with high values in dry season, when the OSS concentrations reduced.

TI  - Formation of a New Island of the Coast of Crimea
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the modern dynamics of Bakalskaya Spit (northwestern Crimea), the distal part of which separated in 2010, becoming an island. It is shown that in the last 200 years, the coastline to its east and west has retreated. Analysis of satellite data and geodetic surveys revealed that in the last 30 years, the distal part of the spit shifted northeast by 300 m and the western branch of the spit shifted east by 160 m. After separation of Peschany Island, its area was 0.56 km(2); by 2018, it had contracted to 0.31 km(2). The width of the strait that formed is about 1 km. It has been suggested that an increase in storm activity and an abnormally high Black Sea level in the previous period led to formation of the island under decreased sediment influx conditions.

TI  - Impact of the June 2018 Saddleworth Moor wildfires on air quality in northern England
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The June 2018 Saddleworth Moor fires were some of the largest UK wildfires on record and lasted for approximately three weeks. They emitted large quantities of smoke, trace gases and aerosols which were transported downwind over the highly populated regions of Manchester and Liverpool. Surface observations of PM2.5 indicate that concentrations were 4-5.5 times higher than the recent seasonal average. State-of-the-art satellite measurements of total column carbon monoxide (TCCO) from the TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel 5-Precursor (S5P) platform, coupled with measurements from a flight of the UKBAe-146-301 research aircraft, are used to quantify the substantial enhancement in emitted trace gases. The aircraft measured plume enhancements with near-fire CO and PM2.5 concentrations >1500 ppbv and >125 mu g m(-3) (compared to similar to 100 ppbv and similar to 5 mu g m(-3) background concentrations). Downwind fire-plume ozone (O-3) values were larger than the near-fire location, indicating O-3 production with distance from source. The near-fire O-3:CO ratio was (Delta O-3/Delta CO) 0.001 ppbv/ppbv, increasing downwind to 0.060-0.105 ppbv/ppbv, suggestive of O-3 production enhancement downwind of the fires. Emission rates of CO and CO2 ranged between 1.07 (0.07-4.69) kg s(-1) and 13.7 (1.73-50.1) kg s(-1), respectively, similar to values expected from a medium sized power station.

TI  - Population-level diagnosis and care cascade for chlamydia in Australia
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Key strategies to control chlamydia include testing, treatment, partner management and re-testing. We developed a diagnosis and care cascade for chlamydia to highlight gaps in control strategies nationally and to inform efforts to optimise control programmes.Methods The Australian Chlamydia Cascade was organised into four steps: (1) annual number of new chlamydia infections (including re-infections); (2) annual number of chlamydia diagnoses; (3) annual number of diagnoses treated; (4) annual number of diagnoses followed by a re-test for chlamydia within 42-180 days of diagnosis. For 2016, we estimated the number of infections among young men and women aged 15-29 years in each of these steps using a combination of mathematical modelling, national notification data, sentinel surveillance data and previous research studies.Results Among young people in Australia, there were an estimated 248 580 (range, 240 690-256 470) new chlamydia infections in 2016 (96 470 in women; 152 100 in men) of which 70 164 were diagnosed (28.2% overall: women 43.4%, men 18.6%). Of the chlamydia infections diagnosed, 65 490 (range, 59 640-70 160) were treated (93.3% across all populations), but only 11 330 (range, 7660-16 285) diagnoses were followed by a re-test within 42-180 days (17.3% overall: women 20.6%, men 12.5%) of diagnosis.Conclusions The greatest gaps in the Australian Chlamydia Cascade for young people were in the diagnosis and re-testing steps, with 72% of infections undiagnosed and 83% of those diagnosed not re-tested: both were especially low among men. Treatment rates were also lower than recommended by guidelines. Our cascade highlights the need for enhanced strategies to improve treatment and re-testing coverage such as short message service reminders, point-of-care and postal test kits.

TI  - Towards national-scale characterization of grassland use intensity from integrated Sentinel-2 and Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased availability of systematically acquired high spatial and temporal resolution optical imagery improves the characterization of dynamic land surface processes such as agriculture. The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates. The mapped mowing patterns depict typical management regimes across Germany. Overall, our results exemplify the value of multi-sensor time series applications for characterizing land use intensity across large areas.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Solar Energy Potential for Domestic and Agricultural Utilization to Diminish Poverty in Jubek State, South Sudan, Africa
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to generate informative data on solar radiation in order to establish sustainable solar energy that will support domestic needs and agricultural production and processing industries in Jubek State, South Sudan. Solar radiation intensity, timely data variation, site landscape, and environment were considered. Input data used was remotely sensed data, digital elevation model, land used land cover (LULC) processed with Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System (ArcGIS). The spatio-temporal distribution analysis results show that (62%) 11,356.7 km(2) of the study area is suitable for solar energy farm with an annual potential of about 6.05 x 109 GWh/year out of which only 69.0158 GW h/year is required to meet the local demand of 492,970 people residing in the study area, i.e., 0.11% (1249.2 km(2)) of Jubek State. Solar energy required for producing and processing 1 ton of different crop ranges between 58.39 x 10(-6) and 1477.9 x 10(-6) GWh and area size between 10.7 and 306.3 km(2), whereas 1 ton of animal production requires solar energy ranging between 750.1 x 10(-6) and 8334 x 10(-6) GWh and area of about 137.8 to 1531.5 km(2). These findings will assist in the establishment of agro-processing industries which will eventually lead to poverty reduction through job creation and improvement of food quantity and quality. The simple approach applied in this study is unique, especially for the study area, thus it can be applied to some other locations following the same steps.

TI  - Sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome in individuals of European ancestry: a genome-wide association study
T2  - LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lung inflammatory process caused mainly by sepsis. Most previous studies that identified genetic risks for ARDS focused on candidates with biological relevance. We aimed to identify novel genetic variants associated with ARDS susceptibility and to provide complementary functional evidence of their effect in gene regulation.Methods We did a case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1935 European individuals, using patients with sepsis-associated ARDS as cases and patients with sepsis without ARDS as controls. The discovery stage included 672 patients admitted into a network of Spanish intensive care units between January, 2002, and January, 2017. The replication stage comprised 1345 individuals from two independent datasets from the MESSI cohort study (Sep 22, 2008-Nov 30, 2017; USA) and the VISEP (April 1, 2003-June 30, 2005) and MAXSEP (Oct 1, 2007-March 31, 2010) trials of the SepNet study (Germany). Results from discovery and replication stages were meta-analysed to identify association signals. We then used RNA sequencing data from lung biopsies, in-silico analyses, and luciferase reporter assays to assess the functionallity of associated variants.Findings We identified a novel genome-wide significant association with sepsis-associated ARDS susceptibility (rs9508032, odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.91, p=5.18 x 10(-8)) located within the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) gene, which encodes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1). The region containing the sentinel variant and its best proxies acted as a silencer for the FLT1 promoter, and alleles with protective effects in ARDS further reduced promoter activity (p=0.0047). A literature mining of all previously described ARDS genes validated the association of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.73; p=4.69 x 10(-5)).Interpretation A common variant within the FLT1 gene is associated with sepsis-associated ARDS. Our findings support a role for the vascular endothelial growth factor signalling pathway in ARDS pathogenesis and identify VEGFR-1 as a potential therapeutic target. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes in the six major glaciers of the Chitral River basin (Hindukush Region of Pakistan) between 2001 and 2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the northern Pakistan are a distinctive source of freshwater for the irrigation, drinking and industrial water supplies of the people living in those regions and downstream. These glaciers are under a direct global warming impact as indicated in many previous studies. In this study, we estimated the glacier dynamics in terms of Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA), mass balance and the snout position variation using remote sensing data between 2001 and 2018. Six glaciers, having area >= 20 km(2) each, situated in the Chitral region (Hindukush Mountains) were investigated in this study. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and available cloud-free continuous series of Landsat and Sentinel the entire study area was a retreat of -231 +/- 140 m. No obvious relationship was found between the glacier variation trends and the available gauged climatic data possibly due to the presence of debris cover in ablation zones of all the studied glaciers which provides insulation and reduces the immediate climatic effects.

Horizontal distribution of surface characteristics of eddies is analyzed by using 24 years (1993-2016) of AVHRR infrared satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and 7 years (2010-2016) of sea surface salinity (SSS) of SMOS satellite data. Surface eddy centric composite analysis reveals the existence of warm (cold) and diverse SSS anomalies for anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. During winter, it is important to note that the eddy induced SST and SSS anomalies show the dipole patterns show opposite phases for the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Observed diploe structures are consistent with the eddy rotation and background large-scale meridional gradient of temperature and salinity fields. The 3D structure of eddies is investigated by using the ARMOR3D and Argo float profiles. The horizontal distribution of temperature and salinity anomalies from ARMOR3D signify the monopole structure of eddies in the subsurface layers. Further, the analysis of composite averages of 241 (200) Argo temperature profiles indicates the core of anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies centered at about similar to 140 m (similar to 100 m). However, salinity profiles depict the existence of core at similar to 65 m (similar to 50 m). This study have practical relevance to a variety of stakeholders and finds profound importance in the validation of eddy-resolving ocean models for the BoB region.

TI  - Evaluation of Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Landsat 8/TIRS Images before and after Stray Light Correction Using the SURFRAD Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8/thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) is suffering from the problem of stray light that makes an inaccurate radiance for two thermal infrared (TIR) bands and the latest correction was conducted in 2017. This paper focused on evaluation of land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from Landsat 8 before and after the correction using ground-measured LST from five surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites. Results indicated that the correction increased the band radiance at the top of the atmosphere for low temperature but decreased such radiance for high temperature. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of LST retrieval decreased by 0.27 K for Band 10 and 0.78 K for Band 11 using the single-channel algorithm. For the site with high temperature, the LST retrieval RMSE of the single-channel algorithm for Band 11 even reduced by 1.4 K. However, the accuracy of two of three split-window algorithms adopted in this paper decreased. After correction, the single-channel algorithm for Band 10 and the linear split-window algorithm had the least RMSE (approximately 2.5 K) among five adopted algorithms. Moreover, besides SURFRAD sites, it is necessary to validate using more robust and homogeneous ground-measured datasets to help solely clarify the effect of the correction on LST retrieval.

TI  - Investigating the Recent Surge in the Monomah Glacier, Central Kunlun Mountain Range with Multiple Sources of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several glaciers in the Bukatage Massif are surge-type. However, previous studies in this region focused on glacier area and length changes, and more information is needed to support the deep analysis of glacier surge. We determined changes in glacier thickness, motion, and surface features in this region based on TanDEM-X, ALOS/PRISM, Sentinel-1A, and Landsat images. Our results indicated that the recent surge of the Monomah Glacier, the largest glacier in the Bukatage Massif, started in early 2009 and ceased in late 2016. From 2009 to 2016, its area and length respectively increased by 6.27 km(2) and 1.45 km, and its ice tongue experienced three periods of changes: side broadening (2009-2010), rapid advancing (2010-2013), and slow expansion (2013-2016). During 2000-2012, its accumulation zone was thinned by 50 m, while its ice tongue was thickened by 90 m. During 2015-2017, its flow velocity reduced from 1.2 to 0.25 m/d, and the summer velocities were much higher than winter velocities. We conclude that the recent Monomah Glacier surge is thermal-controlled. The subglacial temperature rose to the pressure-melting point because of substantial mass accumulation, and then the increased basal meltwater caused the surge.

TI  - Inversion of Rice Height Using Multitemporal TanDEM-X Polarimetric Interferometry SAR Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice height, an important index of rice growth monitoring, is a comprehensive reflection of rice itself, soil, hydrology and meteorology. So accurate, efficient, and large-scale inversion of rice crop height can provide reliable basis for rice identification, phenological monitoring, pest and yield estimation. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), because of its all-weather day-night imaging capability, has been proven to be one of the important means for inversion of rice height. Based on polarimetric SARinterferometry (PolInSAR), the inversion algorithm of scattering model has the characteristics of support of rigorous physical model and high inversion accuracy, which has become a hot spot of inversion of vegetation height. In this paper, based on PolInSAR technology, a new method based on Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model for rice height inversion was proposed. The inversion experiment of rice height was carried out using the TanDEM-X PolInSAR data of 9 time phases in the rice growing season of 2015. First of all, 8 complex coherence coefficients were obtained based on PolInSAR data in each phase. and these were used for a product of decorrelation under the consideration of satellite dual-station mode. Then, the RVoG model was established for the characteristics of paddy fields. Moreover, using this model, an iterative algorithm of rice height inversion was constructed. Finally, the rice height inversion and precision evaluation using TanDEM-X data of 9 time phases were carried out. The results showed that when rice height was higher than 0. 4 m, a coefficient of determination (R-2) of was 0. 86 and RMSE was 6. 69 cm. When rice height was low (rice height was less than 40 cm), inversion resultswith inversion error of 0. 1 similar to 0. 8 m were significantly overestimated. Through analysis, on the premise that TanDEM X data reflect volume scattering of rice plants well, the inversion algorithm of rice height based on RVOG model can invert the rice height between 0. 33 similar to 1. 2 m with high precision.

TI  - Evaluation on the Vertical Distribution of Liquid and Ice Phase Cloud Fraction in Community Atmosphere Model Version 5.3 using Spaceborne Lidar Observations
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud partition between liquid and ice phases and their vertical distributions are crucial to energy budget and global climate. Liquid and ice cloud fractions simulated by Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 and Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observational Simulator Package version 1.4 are evaluated by comparing to satellite retrieval data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation. Model underestimates liquid cloud by 3.3%, 5.5%, and 3.1% and overestimates ice cloud by 1.5%, 6.3%, and 4.6% in high, medium, and low levels, respectively. The misclassification of liquid cloud to ice cloud occurs in all model levels, leading to an overall underestimation of supercooled liquid fraction (SLF) globally and a shift of 50% SLF line from about -20 degrees C in observation to -5 degrees C in model. Specifically, model produces excessive ice cloud in extratropics and insufficient liquid cloud in tropics at mixed-phase levels with temperature between 0 and -40 degrees C.Plain Language Summary Cloud contains water droplets and ice crystals. In temperature between 0 and -40 degrees C, supercooled water can coexist with ice particles. The ratio of liquid phase to total cloud amount and its vertical distribution could modulate the solar energy reaching the Earth's surface and impact on the global climate. We ran a global climate model and compared the liquid fraction of cloud with satellite measurements. The model produces more ice, but less liquid cloud in all vertical levels thus underestimates the liquid fraction of cloud. The bias is significant in the levels with coexisted ice and supercooled water clouds and in tropical and high-latitude regions. The deficiencies in cloud calculation scheme in model are discussed and that could shed a light on future model improvement.

TI  - Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Early Physiotherapy to Reduce Incidence of Lymphedema After Breast Cancer Surgery: an Institutional Experience
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Newer advances in breast cancer management have led to increased disease free survival and overall survival. It is important to prevent debilitating complications after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to be able to successfully translate this survival benefit to quality of life benefit. By reducing disruption of lymphatic channels, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) decreases incidence of lymphedema (LE). Initiating early physiotherapy regimens, too, improves arm symptoms. In this review, we analyze the incidence of LE at our center and compare it with western literature. Retrospective analysis of all post-surgery breast cancer 18 patients, who followed up routinely with our oncophysiotherapist, was carried out. Incidence of LE in patients undergoing SLNB or ALND was followed up for a mean period of 17.5 months. Only 3.6%, i.e., 6 patients out of 166 developed LE. Amongst 166, 80 had only SLNB; the rest had ALND (either upfront or post-positive SLNB). None of the SLNB only cohort patients developed LE. SLNB in clinically node negative axilla, followed by initiation of arm physiotherapy early in post-operative period, may reduce LE incidence in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Walking in Two Worlds
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This phenomenological study sought to reveal the meaning for and experience of individuals who navigate two often-disparate ideological and experiential "worlds" within the culture of the United States. These two worlds can be described, respectively, as animistic-being embedded in and giving priority to relationship and nature-and Western mainstream-being embedded in and giving priority to materialism and rationalism. The phenomenon examined was-functioning within the mainstream culture while experiencing an animistic lifeworld. The animistic worldview is at odds in significant ways with the belief systems underlying the prevailing worldview, and is often misunderstood and demeaned. Six participants and the researcher participated in this qualitative study. The interviews were semistructured and open-ended. Through analysis, the underlying constituents and essential structure of the experience emerged. Constituents were (a) the experience of social stigma, (b) a deeply relational way of being-in-the-world, and (c) an expansive sense of identity. An experience of both belonging and alienation emerged-the true self-world remains concealed behind a "veil" or "mask" for the person's protection in mainstream culture. Further research, particularly to benefit clinicians and clients, is needed to expand understanding of these dynamics which so affect people who walk in two worlds.

TI  - Estimating the Protein Concentration in Rice Grain Using UAV Imagery Together with Agroclimatic Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and climate change can potentially change not only rice production but also rice nutrient content. To adapt a rice-dependent country's farming to the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to assess and monitor the potential risk that climate change poses to agriculture. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between rice grain protein content (GPC) and meteorological variables through unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing and meteorological measurements. Furthermore, a method for GPC estimation that combines remote sensing data and meteorological variables was proposed. The conclusions of this study were as follows: (1) The accuracy and robustness of the GPC estimation model were improved by evaluating the nitrogen condition with the green normalized difference vegetation index at the heading stage (GNDVI(heading)) and evaluating photosynthesis with the average daily solar radiation during the grain-filling stage (SRgrain-filling). GPC estimation considering SRgrain-filling in addition to GNDVI(heading) was able to estimate the observed GPC under the different conditions. (2) Increased temperature from the transplantation date to the heading stage can affect increased GPC when extreme temperature does not cause the heat stress.

TI  - Artemether-Lumefantrine and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Retain High Efficacy for Treatment of Uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Malaria in Myanmar
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong Subregion threatens both the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), the first-line treatment for malaria, and prospects for malaria elimination. Monitoring of ACT efficacy is essential for ensuring timely updates to elimination policies and treatment recommendations. In 2014-2015, we assessed the therapeutic efficacies of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum at three study sites in Rakhine, Shan, and Kachin states in Myanmar. Patients presenting with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled, treated, and followed up for 28 days for AL or 42 days for DP. Both AL and DP demonstrated good therapeutic efficacy at all three study sites. The 28-day cure rate for AL was > 96% across all study sites, and the 42-day cure rate for DP was 100%. Parasitemia on day 3 was detected in 0%, 3.3%, and 3.6% of participants treated with AL at the Rakhine, Shan, and Kachin sites, respectively. No participants treated with DP were parasitemic on day 3. No evidence of P. falciparum k13 mutations was found at the Rakhine study site. A high prevalence of k13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance was observed at the Kachin and Shan state study sites. These results confirm that ACT efficacy has been resilient in therapeutic efficacy study (TES) sentinel sites in Myanmar, despite the presence at some sites of k13 mutations associated with resistance. Studies are ongoing to assess whether this resilience persists.

This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art image matchers using nine open-source and commercial software packages on aerial and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and five software packages on spaceborne images. Two datasets provide an update on DSM generation software for both airborne and spaceborne data: a 5 x 5 UAV image block with high-precision models; and a WorldView-1 stereopair with lidar reference data. To understand the performance of the image matchers, accuracy analysis is additionally performed on five selected ground objects. The tested image matchers adopting hierarchical semi-global matching fitted the reference DSM better, thus yielding better accuracy.

TI  - Inland harmful cyanobacterial bloom prediction in the eutrophic Tri An Reservoir using satellite band ratio and machine learning approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Tri An, a drinking water reservoir for millions of people in southern Vietnam, has been affected by harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs), raising concerns about public health. It is, therefore, crucial to gain insights into the outbreak mechanism of HCBs and understand the spatiotemporal variations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in this highly turbid and productive water. This study aims to evaluate the predictable performance of both approaches using satellite band ratio and machine learning for Chl-a concentration retrieval-a proxy of HCBs. The monthly water quality samples collected from 2016 to 2018 and 23 cloud free Sentinel-2A/B scenes were used to develop Chl-a retrieval models. For the band ratio approach, a strong linear relationship with in situ Chl-a was found for two-band algorithm of Green-NIR. The band ratio-based model accounts for 72% of variation in Chl-a concentration from 2016 to 2018 datasets with an RMSE of 5.95 mu g/L. For the machine learning approach, Gaussian process regression (GPR) yielded superior results for Chl-a prediction from water quality parameters with the values of 0.79 (R-2) and 3.06 mu g/L (RMSE). Among various climatic parameters, a high correlation (R-2 = 0.54) between the monthly total precipitation and Chl-a concentration was found. Our analysis also found nitrogen-rich water and TSS in the rainy season as the driving factors of observed HCBs in the eutrophic Tri An Reservoir (TAR), which offer important solutions to the management of HCBs in the future.

TI  - Integrating Data-Driven and Participatory Modeling to Simulate Future Urban Growth Scenarios: Findings from Monastir, Tunisia
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Current rapid urbanization trends in developing countries present considerable challenges to local governments, potentially hindering efforts towards sustainable urban development. To effectively anticipate the challenges posed by urbanization, participatory modeling techniques can help to stimulate future-oriented decision-making by exploring alternative development scenarios. With the example of the coastal city of Monastir, we present the results of an integrated urban growth analysis that combines the SLEUTH (slope, land use, exclusion, urban extent, transportation, and hill shade) cellular automata model with qualitative inputs from relevant local stakeholders to simulate urban growth until 2030. While historical time-series of Landsat data fed a business-as-usual prediction, the quantification of narrative storylines derived from participatory scenario workshops enabled the creation of four additional urban growth scenarios. Results show that the growth of the city will occur at different rates under all scenarios. Both the "business-as-usual" (BaU) prediction and the four scenarios revealed that urban expansion is expected to further encroach on agricultural land by 2030. The various scenarios suggest that Monastir will expand between 127-149 hectares. The information provided here goes beyond simply projecting past trends, giving decision-makers the necessary support for both understanding possible future urban expansion pathways and proactively managing the future growth of the city.

TI  - Predictors of severe or multiple subsequent injuries over 24 months among an already-injured cohort in New Zealand
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Interventions to reduce subsequent injuries among already-injured people presenting to healthcare providers may reduce the overall burden of injury. However, in order to develop such interven-tions it is necessary to understand what predicts subsequent injuries. This knowledge is currently limited for general injury populations. This prospective Subsequent Injury Study aims to determine pre-injury sociodemographic and heath factors, and injury-related factors, that predict subsequent injury claims re-ported to Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC, New Zealand's universal injury insurer) in the 24 months following an ACC entitlement claim injury ('sentinel' injury). Two separate outcome variables were used to identify subsequent injuries of interest: having (1) at least one high severity injury claim (New Injury Severity Scores >= 4), or (2) two or more claims (injuries of any severity).Methods: This study combines: (1) participant interviews (from our earlier Prospective Outcomes of In-jury Study), (2) ACC data about sentinel injuries which led to participants being recruited, and all sub-sequent injuries involving an ACC claim in the 24 months following that sentinel injury, and (3) hospital discharge data for sentinel and subsequent injuries involving hospitalisation. Potential predictors (pre-sentinel injury sociodemographic and health variables, sentinel injury related variables) were identified using modified Poisson regression models.Results: Severe and multiple ACC-reported subsequent injuries (ACC-SI) were each more likely to occur for participants with a self-reported prior injury affecting them at the time of their sentinel injury, and for those who prior to their sentinel injury event had pain/discomfort, or were physically active on five or more days of the week. A lower likelihood of severe or multiple ACC-SI was more common in those aged 30-64 years compared with those aged 18-29 years, those of 'other' ethnicity compared to sole New Zealand European ethnicity, and if the sentinel injury involved hospitalisation. Multiple ACC-SI were more likely for males, and for participants with >= 2 chronic conditions compared to those with none.Conclusions: Factors identified in this study may provide useful flags to help healthcare providers and policy makers identify people at increased risk of severe or multiple subsequent injuries who may benefit from targeted injury prevention strategies or interventions.

TI  - Global Dimming and Brightening Features during the First Decade of the 21st Century
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward surface solar radiation (SSR) trends for the first decade of the 2000s were computed using a radiative transfer model and satellite and reanalysis input data and were validated against measurements from the reference global station networks Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) and Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). Under all-sky conditions, in spite of a somewhat patchy structure of global dimming and brightening (GDB), an overall dimming was found that is weaker in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere (-2.2 and -3.1 W m(-2), respectively, over the 2001-2009 period). Dimming is observed over both land and ocean in the two hemispheres, but it is more remarkable over land areas of the Southern Hemisphere. The post-2000 dimming is found to have been primarily caused by clouds, and secondarily by aerosols, with total cloud cover contributing -1.4 W m(-2) and aerosol optical thickness -0.7 W m(-2) to the global average dimming of -2.65 W m(-2). The evaluation of the model-computed GDB against BSRN and GEBA measurements indicates a good agreement, with the same trends for 65% and 64% of the examined stations, respectively. The obtained model results are in line with other studies for specific world regions and confirm the occurrence of an overall solar dimming over the globe during the first decade of 21st century. This post-2000 dimming has succeeded the global brightening observed in the 1990s and points to possible impacts on the ongoing global warming and climate change.

TI  - Characteristics of Surface Deformation in Lanzhou with Sentinel-1A TOPS
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - While surface deformations and their impact on buildings have been observed in the city of Lanzhou, it is difficult to find studies of surface deformation and the influential factors in the recent decades. This study was designed to detect the spatial position of these surface deformations and to understand the mechanism behind them. Sentinel-1A TOPS model image data acquired in descending orbits between March 2015 and May 2019 were processed by using Small Baseline Subsets Interferometry (SBAS)-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology, and then compared with geology, tectonical aspects of the study area and land cover types in Lanzhou. The results reveal that the land surface deformation is uneven in this city, and seven surface deformation regions were detected in the following areas: the north freight yard, Jiuzhou, Country garden, Donggang, Yanjiaping, Zhongxinping and Liuquan town. The land surface deformation rate in Lanzhou ranges from -82.13 mm/year to 19.31 mm/year. Time-series land surface deformation analysis showed that deformation increased over time in major deformation regions. Surface deformation expansion was significant after June 2017and it continued to expand. The surface deformation of Lanzhou is affected by natural factors (geology and geological faults) and human activities (land cover types/land cover changes). Local geological conditions control the location of the surface deformation process. These findings provide compelling data and theoretical support for disaster prevention and reduction in Lanzhou.

TI  - Meteorological Tsunami of 19 March 2017 in the Persian Gulf: Observations and Analyses
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 19 March 2017, destructive tsunami-like waves impacted the northeast shore of the Persian Gulf (PG). The maximum surveyed runup of about 3 m was observed at Dayyer in southern Iran, where damaging waves inundated the land for a distance of similar to 1 km and resulted in the deaths of five people. Because the PG has always been considered safe from extreme oceanic waves, the event was totally unexpected. In this study, we examined sea level data from 12 stations across the PG and a variety of meteorological information, including satellite imagery, high-altitude isohypse maps and high-resolution air pressure records from 47 instruments along the PG. Our results show that the event was very local, with recorded maximum trough-to-crest wave heights of 197 cm at Dayyer and 234 cm at Asaluyeh, near-field cities in Iran located similar to 80 km apart. The dominant wave periods were in the range of 15-20 min. At all distant tide gauges, the observed wave heights were < 35 cm. No earthquakes or landslides were evident at the time of the event. On the other hand, atmospheric processes during 18-22 March were very active and 10 distinctive tsunamigenic air pressure disturbances were observed propagating over the PG, suggesting that the event of 19 March 2017 was a "meteorological tsunami". Atmospheric conditions over the PG were highly favourable for the generation of meteotsunamis and very similar to those that caused a chain of strong meteotsunamis in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions during 23-27 June 2014. Based on the 500 hPa wind, we evaluated that the disturbances had propagation speeds of 21-38 m/s, with the disturbance at Dayyer having a speed of similar to 26 m/s toward 77 degrees True. The Froude number, Fr (estimated as the ratio of the air disturbance speed to the long wave speed), on 19 March 2017 in the Dayyer/Asaluyeh region was close to resonance, Fr similar to 0.9 to 1.1, which is highly favourable for meteotsunami generation. Our findings indicate that the Dayyer/Asaluyeh area is a "hot spot" that is highly vulnerable to extreme, weather-induced tsunami-like waves.

TI  - Ship-Iceberg Detection & Classification in Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellites provide good resolution all weather SAR images. We describe algorithms for detection and classification of ships, icebergs and other objects at sea. Sidelobes from strongly reflecting objects as large ships are suppressed for better determination of ship parameters. The resulting improved ship lengths and breadths are larger than the ground truth values known from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data due to the limited resolution in the processing of the SAR images as compared to previous analyses of Sentinel-2 optical images. The limited resolution in SAR imagery degrades spatial classification algorithms but it is found that the backscatter horizontal and vertical polarizations can be exploited to distinguish icebergs in the Arctic from large ships but not small boats or wakes.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the results of MRI (magnetic resonance image) guided ROLL (radioguided occult lesion localization) and SNOLL (sentinel node occult lesion localization) in the localization of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, as well as assessing the surgical results obtained and disease free survival.Methods: Prospective observational analysis of 132 patients with 136 tumors, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our hospital between 2011-2017. Residual disease was located presurgically with MRI guided ROLL/SNOLL technique. We analyzed technical aspects of localization, and variables corresponding to surgical procedures and events occurred during follow-up.Results: The median tumor size was of 20.5mm (interquartilic range [IQR]: 14-28). The majority (96.3%) were invasive ductal carcinomas. Sentinel lymph node detection rate was 98.9%. Complete pathological response (CPR) in the breast was achieved in 58.1% of cases. The rate of affected margins in 89 cases operated by conservative surgery was 2.2%. With a median follow-up of 50 months (IQR: 37-61) we found a 7.4% rate of relapses. Of these, seven were loco-regional and three at distant sites. The estimated mean of disease-free survival time was 83.2 months (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 79.6-86.6).Conclusions: MRI guided ROLL/SNOLL is a great tool for breast cancer residual disease localization follo-wing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, this technique attains good loco-regional control of the diseases and has excellent surgical results.(c) 2020 Sociedad Espa & ntilde;ola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

TI  - Immunosuppression of aquatic organisms exposed to elevated levels of manganese: From global to molecular perspective
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace metal for all organisms. However, in excess it causes toxic effects but the impact on aquatic environments has so far been highly overlooked. Manganese is abundant both in costal and deep sea sediments and becomes bioavailable (Mn2+) during redox conditions. This is an increasing phenomenon due to eutrophication-induced hypoxia and aggravated through the ongoing climate change. Intracellular accumulation of Mn2+ causes oxidative stress and activates evolutionary conserved pathways inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Here, studies are compiled on how excess of dissolved Mn suppresses the immune system of various aquatic organisms by adversely affecting both renewal of immunocytes and their functionality, such as phagocytosis and activation of pro-phenoloxidase. These impairments decrease the animal's bacteriostatic capacity, indicating higher susceptibility to infections. Increased distribution of pathogens, which is believed to accompany climate change, requires preserved immune sentinel functions and Mn can be crucial for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions.

TI  - A Retrospective, Cross-Sectional Study on the Prevalence of Hyperuricemia Using a Japanese Healthcare Database
T2  - ARCHIVES OF RHEUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of hyperuricemia (HU) considering both serum uric acid (SUA) levels and medication status of urate-lowering drugs (ULDs), and the association between HU and its comorbidities using a Japanese healthcare database.Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 60,828 subjects who had at least one serum uric acid measurement between the fiscal years (FYs) 2010 and 2014 in a Japanese employment-based health insurance database (MinaCare Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which includes mutually linked medical/pharmaceutical claims data and health check-up data. Hyperuricemia was defined as a SUA level >7.0 mg/dL of the health check-up data and/or a prescription for a ULD. The association between HU and comorbidities were analyzed by comparing the prevalence of HU of each subgroup defined by presence or absence of comorbidity.Results: The prevalence of HU in FY 2014 was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.2 to 27.3%) in male subjects and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7 to 1.0%) in female subjects. According to the analyses by sex and age, a trend of increasing prevalence with age was observed in both males and females. The prevalence of HU remained stable both in males and females from FYs 2010 to 2014. The positive association between HU and well-known comorbidities were confirmed with the exception of diabetes mellitus and smoking status in male subjects.Conclusion: Our results provided a more accurate prevalence of HU in Japanese population. It is important to increase the awareness on HU in the society to reduce the burden of HU-related diseases.

TI  - Basin-scale oceanographic processes, zooplankton community structure, and diet and reproduction of a sentinel North Pacific seabird over a 22-year period
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-driven variation in the distribution, abundance and phenology of low trophic-level organisms can have cascading effects within marine food webs, and understanding these complex ecosystem dynamics is of vital importance in an age of dramatic environmental change. We tested the hypothesis that marine conditions associated with the state of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) exert primary influence on the biogeographic affinities of the zooplankton community, and thus the composition of nestling diets and reproduction of a zooplanktivorous seabird, Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). The 22-year study (1996-2017) took place on Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, located at the northern extreme of the California Current System (NCCS) and site of the world's largest breeding colony. Based on annual zooplankton tows in the vicinity of Triangle Island, the biomass of 'Subarctic' zooplankton species (copepods) was elevated in years in which the PDO was in its negative (cold-water) state. The biomass of 'Subarctic' zooplankton was unrelated to both the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) indices. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed that in those PDO-negative years, diets fed to nestling auklets included more copepod biomass and less euphausiid biomass. Virtually all (> 99%) of the copepod biomass consisted of just one species, Neocalanus cristatus, one of the North Pacific Ocean's diagnostic 'Subarctic' copepods. PCA also identified a secondary effect of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on diets, in that auklet parents delivered more larval fish and less copepods-plus-euphausiids to nestlings in years in which ENSO was in a strongly positive state (i.e., El Nino). The growth rates of nestling auldets, indexed by their mean mass at 25 days of age, was higher in years in which they received more copepods-plus-euphausiids rather than larval fish, and in years in which they received more copepods rather than euphausiids. A previous study in the Central California Current System found that ENSO (to the mid-1990s) and then the NPGO (since the mid-1990s) exerted primary influence on productivity in Cassin's Auklets. In combination, the two studies illustrate how basin-scale climatic processes can non-homogeneously influence productivity in a single species across oceanic domains. For Cassin's Auklet, the contrast can be attributed to latitudinal differences in the prey base (more copepod-based in the north, more euphausiid-based in the south), and linked to ocean transport, temperature, and phenology. This correlational study provides mechanistic insight into ecological functioning in the offshore waters of the NCCS, with application to marine systems elsewhere. We highlight the particular importance of the 'Subarctic' copepods to a zooplanktivorous predator in the NCCS, and the value of seabirds as indicators in this rich marine ecosystem.

TI  - Physically-based land surface temperature modeling in urban areas using a 3-D city model and multispectral satellite data
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigation of urban heat islands requires understanding of the factors affecting the interaction of solar radiation and urban surfaces. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm for high-resolution spatial modeling of land surface temperature by combining the r.sun solar radiation model in GRASS GIS, the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and raster input data derived from a 3-D city model and Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The 3-D city model was the source of the urban land surface geometry and land cover properties, Sentinel 2 data was used to estimate broadband albedo and thermal emissivity. The developed modeling tool also implements the attenuation effect of high vegetation (transmittance) on beam solar irradiance at the ground beneath the vegetation canopy. The transmittance was estimated using the leaf area index as a proxy derived from a linear relationship between Sentinel 2 NDVI and terrestrial LiDAR. The computed land surface temperature was compared to the Landsat 8 derived land surface temperature with a good correlation expressed by a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.88. The proposed approach has the advantage of providing the high spatial detail coupled with the flexibility of GIS to evaluate various geometrical and land surface properties for any daytime horizon.

TI  - Spatial transitions in tree cover are associated with soil hydrology, but not with grass biomass, fire frequency, or herbivore biomass in Serengeti savannahs
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Although there is a well-known association between tree cover and soil texture in savannahs, the hydrological drivers of tree cover variation have not been systematically explored, particularly in parallel with factors such as fire, herbivory, and tree-grass interactions. The relationship between hydrological factors and tree cover is important for resolving the relative contribution of bottom-up versus top-down factors in structuring savannah vegetation.2. We quantified soil moisture dynamics across eight 1-km transects spanning tree cover gradients from open to woody savannah in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania using soil moisture sensors coupled with dataloggers. We mapped tree cover at two spatial scales through supervised classification of high-resolution satellite imagery. We simultaneously produced water retention curves in open and woody habitats within each transect to compare soil hydrological properties and to convert volumetric water content (theta) from dataloggers to plant-available water over the course of an annual cycle. We also quantified grass biomass at 100 locations per transect, estimated fire frequency from MODIS satellite data, and quantified herbivore occupancy with paired camera traps situated in open and woody habitats within each transect.3. We found a positive relationship between tree cover and soil moisture drainage rate, and found that open habitats had more negative water potentials than woody habitats for a given value of theta. In contrast, we found no evidence for a consistent relationship between grass biomass or fire frequency and tree cover. We found evidence for higher browser occupancy in woody than open habitats, but no habitat effects on herbivores as a group (browsers plus grazers), suggesting that herbivory is unlikely to be the dominant factor explaining variation in tree cover.4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that variation in tree cover is partly driven by hydrological (edaphic) factors unrelated to fire, herbivory, tree-grass interactions or mean annual precipitation at these spatial scales in Serengeti. We contrast our findings with previous work attributing tree cover shifts in Serengeti to precipitation gradients.

TI  - Approaches to Identify the Value of Seminatural Habitats for Conservation Biological Control
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invertebrates perform many vital functions in agricultural production, but many taxa are in decline, including pest natural enemies. Action is needed to increase their abundance if more sustainable agricultural systems are to be achieved. Conservation biological control (CBC) is a key component of integrated pest management yet has failed to be widely adopted in mainstream agriculture. Approaches to improving conservation biological control have been largely ad hoc. Two approaches are described to improve this process, one based upon pest natural enemy ecology and resource provision while the other focusses on the ecosystem service delivery using the QuESSA (Quantification of Ecological Services for Sustainable Agriculture) project as an example. In this project, a predictive scoring system was developed to show the potential of five seminatural habitat categories to provide biological control, from which predictive maps were generated for Europe. Actual biological control was measured in a series of case studies using sentinel systems (insect or seed prey), trade-offs between ecosystem services were explored, and heatmaps of biological control were generated. The overall conclusion from the QuESSA project was that results were context specific, indicating that more targeted approaches to CBC are needed. This may include designing new habitats or modifying existing habitats to support the types of natural enemies required for specific crops or pests.

TI  - Buffering the Suffering of Breast Lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast lymphoscintigraphy with Tc-99m-sulfur colloid is frequently performed before breast-conserving surgery to delineate drainage to a sentinel node. Tracer injection for lymphoscintigraphy can be painful. Our aims were to determine whether administering a solution of buffered lidocaine immediately before lymphoscintigraphy injection could both reduce the patients' pain and increase nuclear medicine technologists' satisfaction with performing the procedure. Methods: A pain scale survey was obtained from patients undergoing breast lymphoscintigraphy with or without buffered lidocaine. Our nuclear medicine technologists were also surveyed for their satisfaction with the procedure, both with and without the addition of buffered lidocaine. Results: The patients' reported pain decreased by 86% with the addition of buffered lidocaine. Technologist satisfaction with performing the procedure increased by 36%. Conclusion: Lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate injected before lymphoscintigraphy significantly reduces pain experienced by the patient and improves nuclear medicine technologist satisfaction in performing the procedure.

AB  - Background: The incidence of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) ranged from 0 to 14%. The main hypothesis would be the presence of an invasive contingent on the final histology. The objective was to identify predictive factors of sentinel lymph node positivity in the management of extended ductal carcinoma in situ treated by simple mastectomy.Methods: This was a retrospective study carried out at the Lorraine Cancer Institute from January 2003 to December 2017. Women with DCIS on core-needle biopsy whose management consisted of simple mastectomy and SLNB procedure were included.Results: 188 patients were analyzed. Preoperatively, 18 patients (9.6%) had DCIS with microinvasion, while the others had pure DCIS. Eight patients (4.2%) had positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, the majority of which were single micrometastases. Predictive factor of node invasion was microinvasion on biopsy (p <0.01). Only in cases of pure DCIS, the percentage of positive SLNB was reduced to 2.9%. Invasive carcinoma was found in the majority of patients with positive axillary SLNB procedure (75%, n = 6), compared to 16.7% (n = 30) without SLNB involvement (p < 0.01).Conclusions: The low rate of positive sentinel node biopsy in pure ductal carcinoma in situ suggests that in the absence of microinvasion, the sentinel procedure would seem less appropriate. New techniques for identifying sentinel lymph node biopsy could report axillary staging after definitive histologic results. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Evaluation of Global Decametric-Resolution LAI, FAPAR and FVC Estimates Derived from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global biophysical products at decametric resolution derived from Sentinel-2 imagery have emerged as a promising dataset for fine-scale ecosystem modeling and agricultural monitoring. Evaluating uncertainties of different Sentinel-2 biophysical products over various regions and vegetation types is pivotal in the application of land surface models. In this study, we quantified the performance of Sentinel-2-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) estimates using global ground observations with consistent measurement criteria. Our results show that the accuracy of vegetation and non-vegetated classification based on Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products is greater than 95%, which indicates the vegetation identification is favorable for the practical application of biophysical estimates, as several LAI, FAPAR, and FVC retrievals were derived for non-vegetated pixels. The rate of best retrievals is similar between LAI and FAPAR estimates, both accounting for 87% of all vegetation pixels, while it is almost 100% for FVC estimates. Additionally, the Sentinel-2 FAPAR and FVC estimates agree well with ground-measurements-derived (GMD) reference maps, whereas a large discrepancy is observed for Sentinel-2 LAI estimates by comparing with both GMD effective LAI (LAI(e)) and actual LAI (LAI) reference maps. Furthermore, the uncertainties of Sentinel-2 LAI, FAPAR and FVC estimates are 1.09 m(2)/m(2), 1.14 m(2)/m(2), 0.13 and 0.17 through comparisons to ground LAI(e), LAI, FAPAR, and FVC measurements, respectively. Given the temporal difference between Sentinel-2 observations and ground measurements, Sentinel-2 LAI estimates are more consistent with LAI(e) than LAI values. The robustness of evaluation results can be further improved as long as more multi-temporal ground measurements across different regions are obtained. Overall, this study provides fundamental information about the performance of Sentinel-2 LAI, FAPAR, and FVC estimates, which imbues our confidence in the broad applications of these decametric products.

TI  - A framework for extracting urban functional regions based on multiprototype word embeddings using points-of-interest data
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies are in an effort to explore urban spatial structure, and urban functional regions have become the subject of increasing attention among planners, engineers and public officials. Attempts have been made to identify urban functional regions using high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images and extensive geo-data. However, the research scale and throughput have also been limited by the accessibility of HSR remote sensing data. Recently, big geo-data are becoming increasingly popular for urban studies since research is still accessible and objective with regard to the use of these data. This study aims to build a novel framework to provide an alternative solution for sensing urban spatial structure and discovering urban functional regions based on emerging geo-data - points of interest (POIs) data and an embedding learning method in the natural language processing (NLP) field. We started by constructing the intraurban functional corpus using a center-context pairs-based approach. A word embeddings representation model for training that corpus was used to extract multiprototype vectors in the second step, and the last step aggregated the functional parcels based on an introduced spatial clustering method, hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). The clustering results suggested that our proposed framework used in this study is capable of discovering the utilization of urban space with a reasonable level of accuracy. The limitation and potential improvement of the proposed framework arc also discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of regional eco-environmental quality before and after earthquake in Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on remote sensing data and the geographic information system processing software platform, we analyzed the eco-environmental quality of Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province before and after the 2017 8 . 8 earthquake. We used the Landsat 8 OLI satellite sensor to obtain remote sensing image data of December 31, 2016 (before the earthquake) and December 18, 2017 (after the earthquake), and extracted the normalized vegetation index, humidity component, surface temperature, and normalized soil index as four indices of green degree, humidity , heat degree and dryness, respectively. We used principal component analysis to obtain the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) from these four indices. According to the RSEI, the eco-environmental quality of Jiuzhaigou County was categorized as excellent, good, medium, poor and worse. In 2016, 24.8% of Jiuzhaigou County areas were in an excellent eco-environment level, which fell to 19.84% after the earthquake in 2017. In 2017, area proportions of the eco-environment quality at poor and medium levels showed an upward trend, accounting 14 17.99% and 33.93%, respectively. The proportion of the area with excellent eco-environment quality in the buffer zone of 15.5 km from the epicenter of the earthquake decreased most, accounting 14 5.01%. In summary, the Jiuzhaigou earthquake in 2017 had significant impacts on the eco-environment quality, particularly in the buffer zone of 15.5 km. The Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve was most impacted among the three nature reserves of Jiuzhaigou County. Our results provide scientific basis for ecological monitoring, disaster assessment, and restoration in Jiuzhaigou area.

TI  - A LAMP-based colorimetric assay to expedite field surveillance of the invasive mosquito species <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryTwo species of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are important mosquito vectors that transmit yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. There are limited vaccine and antiviral options to treat these diseases, and so vector control (chemical or biological) is the main strategy for preventing virus transmission. Active mosquito surveillance employing a range of methods is critical for guiding control programs. The context where surveillance is undertaken includes assessing population dynamics in areas where Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are established and transmitting viruses; delimiting their range during incursions; detecting importations at first ports of entry; or conducting broad-scale presence/absence surveillance in regions vulnerable to invasion. Effective surveillance is underpinned by accurate and rapid identification of collected specimens. Molecular methods can complement more traditional morphological identification in instances when sample numbers are large, specimens are damaged, when related species share overlapping morphology or when diagnostic features in early instar larvae are not developed. Laboratory-based DNA tests are available; however, these require sophisticated equipment and incur lag time for the sample to be shipped and tested, which results in critical delay to implement rapid intervention. In this work, we have developed simple rapid tests to detect Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus that can be performed at or near the field sites, require only a single reaction temperature, and which give a visual colour change when a positive sample is detected. The assays identified all life stages and body components (legs and wings) tested, as well as adult specimens that were held in traps under field conditions for two weeks. They also detected a single 1st instar larva in a sample of >1,000 non-target mosquitoes to expedite ovitrap processing and subsequent morphological identification. The assays should be a useful adjunct to laboratory testing or could be employed as standalone tests.BackgroundYellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in humans. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the most important mosquito vectors involved in their transmission. Accurate identification of these species is essential for the implementation of control programs to limit arbovirus transmission, during suspected detections at ports of first entry, to delimit incursions or during presence/absence surveillance programs in regions vulnerable to invasion. We developed and evaluated simple and rapid colorimetric isothermal tests to detect these two mosquito species based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) targeting the ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1).Methodology/Principal findingsSamples were prepared by homogenizing and heating at 99 C-o for 10 min before an aliquot was added to the LAMP reaction. After 40 min incubation at 65 C-o, a colour change indicated a positive result. The tests were 100% sensitive and species-specific, and demonstrated a limit of detection comparable with PCR-based detection (TaqMan chemistry). The LAMP assays were able to detect target species for various life stages tested (adult, 1(st) instar larva, 4(th) instar larva and pupa), and body components, such as legs, wings and pupal exuviae. Importantly, the LAMP assays could detect Ae. aegypti DNA in mosquitoes stored in Biogents Sentinel traps deployed in the field for 14 d. A single 1(st) instar Ae. aegypti larva could also be detected in a pool of 1,000 non-target 1(st) instar Aedes notoscriptus, thus expediting processing of ovitrap collections obtained during presence/absence surveys. A simple syringe-sponge protocol facilitated the concentration and collection of larvae from the ovitrap water post-hatch.

TI  - Validation and Accuracy Analysis of the Collection 6.1 MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Over the Westernmost City in China Based on the Sun-Sky Radiometer Observations From SONET
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Toward the Kashi region in northwest of China, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from Collection 6 (C6) MYD, Collection 6.1 (C6.1) MOD, and C6.1 MYD during 2016-2017 are compared with ground-based measurements from the Sun- sky Radiometer Network (SONET), and the first comprehensive evaluation of the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) retrievals with a 10-km spatial resolution in the latest C6.1 MYD AOD data set during 2016-2018 is presented. In general, C6.1 MYD AOD products (both of DT and DB algorithm) are the most effective in Kashi of the three collections, and there is an overall underestimation of DB AOD, while DT AOD that slightly outperformed DB AOD in Kashi is overestimated on the whole. As to the factors that influence the accuracy of MODIS AOD, for DB algorithm, the overestimations of the surface reflectance and Single Scattering Albedo that DB aerosol model assumed can cause underestimation of DB AOD retrievals over Kashi, while the ones for DT algorithm are opposite. Besides, the coarse dust particles with lower veracity are predominant in Kashi region, which illustrated that the errors of particle size assumption in C6.1 MYD DT and DB algorithms will make large inversion error of MODIS AOD. Moreover, whatever DB or DT algorithm, the accuracy of AOD is diminished as the aerosol loading increases. The more realistic aerosol models and surface characterizations are necessary during the process of generating the MODIS aerosol retrievals in Kashi region.

TI  - The migration of training samples towards dynamic global land cover mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High quality training samples are essential for global land cover mapping. Traditionally, training samples are collected by field work or via manual interpretation based on high-resolution Google Earth images. Due to the difficulty of training sample collection, regular global land cover mapping is still a challenge. In this study, we developed an automatic training sample migration method based on the first all-season sample set in 2015 and all available archived Landsat 5 TM images in the Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform. By measuring the spectral similarity and spectral distance between the reference spectral and image spectral, we detected and identified the change state of training sample pixels in 2010, 2005, 2000, 1995, and 1990. Overall, 170,925 (66%), 118,586 (64%), 112,092 (67%), 154,931 (63%), and 147,267 (60%) respective training sample pixels were found with no changes over each five-year period. The detection (user's) accuracies of migrated training sample pixels as no change for the first four time periods were 99.25%, 97.65%, 95.03%, and 92.98%, respectively, by comparing with CCI-LC (Climate Change Initiative Land Cover) maps. Classification experiment showed that the migrated training samples can obtain a similar classification accuracy of 71.42% in 2010, when compared to the classification result in 2015 using the same number of training samples. Our study provides a potential solution to resolve the problem of lack of training samples for dynamic global land cover mapping efforts.

TI  - Deep SAR-Net: Learning objects from signals
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) specific deep learning framework for complex-valued SAR images. The conventional deep convolutional neural networks based methods usually take the amplitude information of single-polarization SAR images as the input to learn hierarchical spatial features automatically, which may have difficulties in discriminating objects with similar texture but discriminative scattering patterns. Our novel deep learning framework, Deep SAR-Net, takes complex-valued SAR images into consideration to learn both spatial texture information and backscattering patterns of objects on the ground. On the one hand, we transfer the detected SAR images pre-trained layers to extract spatial features from intensity images. On the other hand, we dig into the Fourier domain to learn physical properties of the objects by joint time-frequency analysis on complex-valued SAR images. We evaluate the effectiveness of Deep SAR-Net on three complex-valued SAR datasets from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X satellite and demonstrate how it works better than conventional deep CNNs, especially on man-made objects classes. The proposed datasets and the trained Deep SAR-Net model with all codes are provided.

TI  - Overlapping evidence of innate immune dysfunction in psychotic and affective disorders
T2  - BRAIN, BEHAVIOR, & IMMUNITY - HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Disturbances of the immune system and immune responses after activation are a common finding in neuropsy-chiatric disorders. Psychotic and affective disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) also share high rates of comorbidity with inflammatory and metabolic disorders. Evidence of elevated circulating inflammatory cytokines, altered numbers and function of immune cells, and evidence of neuroinflammation including activation of microglia in the brain have been found in patients with SCZ, BD and MDD. Often these findings correlate to psychological state at the time of measurement. However, significant variation exists across these studies in many aspects, creating challenges in identifying a specific signature of immune dysfunction in these disorders. Innate immune dysfunction, and alterations in monocytes, the critical sentinel cells of the innate immune system, have been seen repeatedly in all three of these disorders, with frequent overlap in findings. In this review, dysfunction specific to the innate arm of the immune system is compared for overlapping evidence across three major psychotic and affective disorders.

TI  - Assessing the Shape Accuracy of Coarse Resolution Burned Area Identifications
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accuracy assessment of burned area maps has been traditionally performed using pixel-based metrics, with the objective of assessing the accuracy and precision of burned area estimates at local and regional scales. While these assessments are helpful for obtaining consistent estimates of the burned area across many fires and over large areas, pixel-based approaches do not necessarily characterize how well individual fires are mapped. At the individual fire scale, other factors like the shape of the fire have significance regarding ecology, fire succession, and landscape management and determining other fire properties such as the spread rate. We propose a method for evaluating wildfire classification maps, which retains the spatially explicit properties of the burn scar. Our method quantifies the edge error (EE) of burned area classifications and reference maps by calculating the average geometric normal of the evaluated burned area boundary along the burn edge and the two nearest neighbor samples from the reference burn boundary. The metric is a physically meaningful quantification of the EE, which represents the average distance between the boundaries of the reference and evaluated burn scars. The methods are demonstrated by comparing MODIS Burned Area (MCD64A1) maps to Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) maps for 173 total wildfires in the United States. The results indicate that when accounting for the minimum achievable EE (MAEE) due to differing spatial resolutions, the mean EE is less than two MODIS pixels and the magnitude of the errors does not appear to be related to fire size.

TI  - Impact of molecular testing on reported <i>Clostridoides difficile</i> infection rates
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The reported incidence of Clostridoides difficile infection (CDI) has increased in recent years, partly due to broadening adoption of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) replacing enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods. Our aim was to quantify the impact of this switch on reported CDI rates using a large, multihospital, empirical dataset. Methods: We analyzed 9 years of retrospective CDI data (2009-2017) from 47 hospitals in the southeastern United States; 37 hospitals switched to NAAT during this period, including 24 with sufficient pre- and post-switch data for statistical analyses. Poisson regression was used to quantify the NAAT-over-EIA incidence rate ratio (IRR) at hospital and network levels while controlling for longitudinal trends, the proportion of intensive care unit patient days, changes in surveillance methodology, and previously detected infection cluster periods. We additionally used change-point detection methods to identify shifts in the mean and/or slope of hospital-level CDI rates, and we compared results to recorded switch dates. Results: For hospitals that transitioned to NAAT, average unadjusted CDI rates increased substantially after the test switch from 10.9 to 23.9 per 10,000 patient days. Individual hospital IRRs ranged from 0.75 to 5.47, with a network-wide IRR of 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-1.89). Reported CDI rates significantly changed 1.6 months on average after switching to NAAT testing (standard deviation, 1.9 months). Conclusion: Hospitals that switched from EIA to NAAT testing experienced an average postswitch increase of 75% in reported CDI rates after adjusting for other factors, and this increase was often gradual or delayed.

CP  - Ocean-Society-of-India Conference (OSICON)
CL  - Thiruvananthapuram, INDIA
AB  - Altimeter data provide measurements of dynamic topography over the global ocean and is useful for the constraining numerical ocean modeling systems through data assimilation. In this study, sensitivity experiments are carried out to understand the relative impact of Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) extracted from satellite data on a variational assimilation system for the month of August 2013. A first experiment, without assimilation of SLA observations is called CNTR while a second experiment assimilating Ka band Altika SLA into the variational assimilation system is called ALTK. Both experiments assimilated all other observations such as surface and in situ observations of temperature and salinity as well as sea ice concentration. To understand the impact of altimeter observations, we computed the root mean square difference (RMSD) of analyzed temperature from both experiments and showed that the maximum impact is over the Indian Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean and tropical Pacific Ocean regions due to the large displacement change applied to the thermocline depth in the ALTK experiment. We also note that the impact of altimeter on analyzed temperature is over different depths. Finally, the analyzed SSH has less root mean square error (RMSE) with respect to the altimeter observations for ALTK experiment than CNTR experiment over the global ocean and shallow water over the Indian Region (60-105 degrees E, 5-40 degrees N).

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy with preoperative CT lymphography and intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for N0 early tongue cancer: A long-term follow-up study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated the usefulness of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with preoperative computed tomographic lymphography (CTL) and intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging for NO early tongue cancer.Methods: Twenty-seven patients with NO early oral tongue cancer underwent CTL with a 128-slice multidetector row CT scanner to detect SLN on the day before resection of primary tumor and SLN biopsy under ICG fluorescence guidance. We identified the location and number of SLNs mapped by CTL and evaluated whether CTL-enhanced SLNs could be identified intraoperatively as ICG fluorescent lymph nodes. Prognosis was also evaluated.Results: SLNs were detected by CTL in 26 of 27 patients (96.3%). The total and mean numbers of SLNs were 41 and 1.5, respectively. All SLNs enhanced by CTL could be identified intraoperatively as ICG fluorescent lymph nodes. Two SLNs were found under ICG fluorescent guidance in only one patient without SLN enhanced by CTL. Among the 27 patients, five (18.5%) had SLN with metastasis. Median follow-up was 76 months (range 44-82 months). During follow-up, three of 22 patients without SLN metastasis had occult cervical lymph node metastasis. The 5-year overall survival rate was 100%.Conclusion: SLN biopsy with preoperative CTL and intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging is a feasible and reliable procedure, without radioisotope tracers, for neck management in cases of early tongue cancer.

TI  - Immunohistochemical BRAF V600E Expression and Intratumor BRAF V600E Heterogeneity in Acral Melanoma: Implication in Melanoma-Specific Survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Acral melanoma, a distinct form of cutaneous melanoma originating in the glabrous skin of the palms, soles, and nail beds, has a different genetic background from other subtypes of cutaneous melanoma. The roles of oncogenic BRAF mutations of acral melanoma in pathogenesis and patient outcomes have not been fully elucidated. We retrieved a total of 112 patients with primary acral melanoma and checked their BRAF V600E status using immunohistochemical staining of VE1 antibody. Among these cases, 21 acral melanoma samples (18.8%) showed positive BRAF V600E staining, and of those, 11 samples (9.8%) showed a heterogeneous staining pattern, with a mixture of VE1-positive and VE1-negative cells. BRAF V600E positivity was significantly associated with thicker melanoma (p = 0.0015). There was no significant difference in clinicopathological factors between homogeneous and heterogeneous VE1-positive acral melanoma. Both patients with BRAF V600E-positive acral melanoma and those with heterogeneous BRAF V600E had significantly shorter melanoma-specific survival than those with BRAF V600E-negative melanoma in Kaplan-Meier analysis (p = 0.0283 and p = 0.0065, respectively). These findings provide novel insights into the pathobiology of acral melanoma.

TI  - Time series trends of Landsat-based ET using automated calibration in METRIC and SEBAL: The Bekaa Valley, Lebanon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bekaa Valley in Lebanon currently hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. It is also the primary agricultural production area in the country. Groundwater levels in some regions of the valley have decreased by > 15m in the last five years. Water use estimates at the regional and the field scale for this valley are crucial for enhancing resilience and for managing competing sectorial water demands. In this research, we derive a novel time series of field-scale actual evapotranspiration for the Bekaa Valley using two one-source energy balance models for the period 1984-2017, utilizing local weather data and all available original Level 1 Landsat thermal imagery and Level 2 surface reflectance products. We compare a modified METRIC model with an automated hot and cold pixel identification procedure run in batch mode to pySEBAL, a new version of SEBAL, which also has its automated anchors pixel selection algorithm. Analysis of 1200 cloud-masked and gap-filled Landsat-derived ET products show that the two models give comparable water use estimates at the seasonal and annual time steps. We estimate an average annual ET of 652 +/- 53mm (or 800 mcm) over the heavily cultivated valley in the last 34 years (with high agreement between both METRIC and pySEBAL models). Most (64%) of the ET is consumed from blue water in the dry season of May-October. ET in the wet season of November-April consumes > 70% of the precipitation in the Bekaa valley. Annual analysis shows no discernable trend in ET across the valley, but there is an increase in irrigated agriculture in the Orontes Basin in the last five years. METRIC yields 15% higher ET than pySEBAL for the non-agricultural lands in summer. A water balance analysis shows that groundwater storage in the Litani basin is decreasing at a rate of 330 +/- 50 mm yr(-1). The outcome of this research also offers unique opportunities for estimating past and future trends of groundwater withdrawals. Results can provide insights into the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and the required international interventions in the water sector for enhancing the resilience of refugee and local communities.

TI  - Urban heat island intensity and its mitigation strategies in the fast-growing urban area
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change especially rising temperature in the urban areas has become a major focus of attention worldwide because of the impacts having on human beings, biodiversity, and urban ecosystem. Time series Landsat (TM and ETM+) satellite data products have been employed in this study to quantify the spatiotemporal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity for the year of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015, respectively. Biophysical characteristics of the city have been assessed through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI). The thermal behavior of the city varied distinctly. Seasonal LST and biophysical composition of the city has been analyzed to explore the temperature and greenness sensitivity across the city region. The per capita electricity consumption of the city was positively correlated with the surface LST for both summer and autumn/spring season. A relative brightness temperature approach was employed to examine the nature of UHI across the city. It is evident from the observation that the temperature is very high within the city core as well as certain surrounding areas of the city, especially on the southern side. The temperature is comparatively lower on the western side of the city than the eastern region. Certain peripheral regions, however, show a higher temperature. This can be due to the development taking place in the outer areas of the city and destruction of vegetation in the outlying parts of the city. Studied NDVI indicates that vegetation in the city is not balanced. It is high in the western part which maybe because of the locations of different academic institutions, botanical gardens, seminary hills, agricultural land, etc. Whereas, the eastern part is devoid of vegetation. Also, the areas in the periphery, especially near the airport and Ambajhari Lake, has very low vegetation. The bareness is also high in the peripheral regions. Result also shows that street-based heat intensity mitigation helps for urban planning.

TI  - Visualizing and labeling dense multi-sensor earth observation time series: The EO Time Series Viewer
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-spectral spaceborne sensors with different spatial resolutions produce Earth observation (EO) time series (TS) with global coverage. The interactive visualization and interpretation of TS is essential to better understand changes in land-use and land-cover and to extract reference information for model calibration and validation. However, available software tools are often limited to specific sensors or optimized for application-specific visualizations. To overcome these limitations, we developed the EO Time Series Viewer, a free and open source QGIS plugin for user-friendly visualization, interpretation and labeling of multi-sensor TS data. The EO Time Series Viewer (i) combines advantages of spatial, spectral and temporal data visualization concepts that are so far not available in a single tool, (ii) provides maximum flexibility in terms of supported data formats, (iii) minimizes the user-interactions required to load and visualize multi-sensor TS data and (iv) speeds-up labeling of TS data based on enhanced GIS vector tools and formats.

TI  - Egg Parasitoids Survey of <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Maize and Sorghum in Central Mexico
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) is the main maize pest in America and was recently detected as an invasive pest in some countries in Asia and Africa. Among its natural enemies presented in Mexico, Trichogramma pretiosum Riley is the only egg parasitoid used in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs regardless of its effectiveness. A search for natural enemies of S. frugiperda was then carried out to determine whether this parasitoid has been established, and to detect native egg parasitoids or predators associated with this pest. The sentinel technique (egg masses) was used, and then placed in maize and sorghum fields in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman and Platner, an egg parasitoid, and Chelonus insularis Cresson egg-larva parasitoid were recovered from field surveys. Among the natural enemies that preyed on eggs of S. frugiperda, we found mites of the genus Balaustium, and Dermaptera of the genus Doru, both species in great abundance. Laboratory tests were performed to compare the potential parasitism of T. atopovirilia against T. pretiosum. T. atopovirilia obtained 70.14% parasitism while T. pretiosum, 29.23%. In field cages, three doses of the parasitoids were tested. Total parasitism did not exceed 8% in any of the two species, but T. atopovirilia parasitized a greater number of hosts using two and three parasitoids per pest egg. Then, the use of Trichogramma species needs to be reevaluated in biological control programs against S. frugiperda.

TI  - CORN: An Alternative Way to Utilize Time-Series Data of SAR Images in Newly Built Construction Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The limitations in obtaining sufficient datasets for training deep learning networks is preventing many applications from achieving accurate results, especially when detecting new constructions using time-series satellite imagery, since this requires at least two images of the same scene and it must contain new constructions in it. To tackle this problem, we introduce Chronological Order Reverse Network (CORN)-an architecture for detecting newly built constructions in time-series SAR images that does not require a large quantity of training data. The network uses two U-net adaptations to learn the changes between images from both Time 1-Time 2 and Time 2-Time 1 formats, which allows it to learn double the amount of changes in different perspectives. We trained the network with 2028 pairs of 256 x 256 pixel SAR images from ALOS-PALSAR, totaling 4056 pairs for the network to learn from, since it learns from both Time 1-Time 2 and Time 2-Time 1. As a result, the network can detect new constructions more accurately, especially at the building boundary, compared to the original U-net trained by the same amount of training data. The experiment also shows that the model trained with CORN can be used with images from Sentinel-1. The source code is available at https://github.com/Raveerat-titech/CORN.

TI  - Estimation of Crop Water Deficit in Lower Bari Doab, Pakistan Using Reflection-Based Crop Coefficient
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a global realization in all governmental setups of the need to provoke the efficient appraisal of crop water budgeting in order to manage water resources efficiently. This study aims to use the satellite remote sensing techniques to determine the water deficit in the crop rich Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command area. Crop classification was performed using multi-temporal NDVI profiles of Landsat-8 imagery by distinguishing the crop cycles based on reflectance curves. The reflectance-based crop coefficients (Kc) were derived by linear regression between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) cycles of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defined crop coefficients. A MODIS 250 m NDVI product of the last 10 years (2004-2013) was used to identify the best performing crop cycle using Fourier filter method. The meteorological parameters including rainfall and temperature substantiated the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) calculated using the Hargreaves method. The difference of potential ET and actual ET, derived from the reflectance-based Kc calculated using reference NDVI and current NDVI, generates the water deficit. Results depict the strong correlation between ET, temperature and rainfall, as the regions having maximum temperature resulted in high ET and low rainfall and vice versa. The derived Kc values were observed to be accurate when compared with the crop calendar. Results revealed maximum water deficit at middle stage of the crops, which were observed to be particularly higher at the tail of the canal command. Moreover, results also depicted that kharif (summer) crops suffer higher deficit in comparison to rabi (winter) crops due to higher ET demand caused by higher temperature. Results of the research can be utilized for rational allocation of canal supplies and guiding farmers towards usage of alternate sources to avoid crop water stress.

TI  - An Advanced Phase Synchronization Scheme for LT-1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - LuTan-1 (LT-1), i.e., TwinSAR-L, mission is an innovative spaceborne bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission that is based on two satellites operating at L-band with flexible formation flying, which is planned to launch in 2020. The primary objective of LT-1 is to generate a highly accurate global digital elevation model (DEM). Beyond that, LT-1 will serve for the demonstration of some state-of-the-art technologies in radar field and some applications, such as biomass inversion, disaster forecasting, and climate and environmental monitoring, and phase synchronization is a technical challenge in realizing the highly accurate topography and deformation measurements. The pulsed alternate synchronization scheme, which is proposed to solve the synchronization problem of TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM)-X, is an efficient and accurate method. However, it interrupts the normal work of the TanDEM-X, accordingly flowing a series of problems. For LT-1, a novel synchronization scheme, in which the phase synchronization signal is exchanged by virtue of a time slot between radar signals, is applied. Thus, the working efficiency and synchronization accuracy can further be improved. Furthermore, the performance prediction and phase synchronization experiment for this synchronization scheme is presented, which verifies the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Finally, in order to guarantee the transmission quality of the synchronization signal, the illumination combinations and gain variation of the synchronization antenna in an orbital period are detailed.

TI  - Asian Cities are Greening While Some North American Cities are Browning: Long-Term Greenspace Patterns in 16 Cities of the Pan-Pacific Region
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-Pacific cities are home to nearly 55% of the world's urban residents. As the fastest growing urban centers in the world, their growth comes with increasing demand for urban amenities such as greenspace. Yet, our understanding of greenspace trends within and among pan-Pacific cities is limited due to a lack of consistent long-term land cover data necessary for transnational comparisons. We tracked and compared greenspace patterns in 16 major pan-Pacific cities over 28 years. We asked: (1) How do long-term trends in greenspace heterogeneity differ among pan-Pacific cities? and (2) How do these patterns vary along urban-rural gradients? To characterize greenspace, we distinguished four vegetation density classes using normalized difference vegetation indices from annual Landsat composites spanning 1984-2012. First, we assessed long-term trends in greenspace spatial patterns. Second, we evaluated greenspace change along a gradient outward from city centers. We found that although GDP increased in all cities in recent decades, their greenspace patterns diverged into either greening or browning trends. In greening cities, expansion of dense vegetation, mostly in the outskirts of cities, resulted in greater greenspace connectivity. In contrast, browning cities lost dense vegetation in rural fringes, yet not in their urban centers. In Asian cities, dense vegetation increased in areal extent and connectivity over time as well as outward along the urban-rural gradient, in contrast to most North American cities. These differences in greenspace heterogeneity and connectivity over time and space imply that strategies and policies derived from North American cities may not be directly applicable to Asian cities.

TI  - Changes in Atmospheric, Meteorological, and Ocean Parameters Associated with the 12 January 2020 Taal Volcanic Eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taal volcano erupted on 12 January 2020, the first time since 1977. About 35 mild earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.0) were observed on 12 January 2020 induced from the eruption. In the present paper, we analyzed optical properties of volcanic aerosols, volcanic gas emission, ocean parameters using multi-satellite sensors, namely, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder), OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) and ground observations, namely, Argo, and AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) data. Our detailed analysis shows pronounced changes in all the parameters, which mainly occurred in the western and south-western regions because the airmass of the Taal volcano spreads westward according to the analysis of airmass trajectories and wind directions. The presence of finer particles has been observed by analyzing aerosol properties that can be attributed to the volcanic plume after the eruption. We have also observed an enhancement in SO2, CO, and water vapor, and a decrease in Ozone after a few days of the eruption. The unusual variations in salinity, sea temperature, and surface latent heat flux have been observed as a result of the ash from the Taal volcano in the south-west and south-east over the ocean. Our results demonstrate that the observations combining satellite with ground data could provide important information about the changes in the atmosphere, meteorology, and ocean parameters associated with the Taal volcanic eruption.

TI  - Assessment of spatial and temporal variation of ecological environment quality in Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve, Xinjiang, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology can objectively and quantitatively evaluate spatial-temporal change of ecological environmental quality. This paper uses images from Landsat5 Thematic Mapper (TM) in 2007 and Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) in 2013 and 2016 to extract indicators such as greenness, wetness, heat, and dryness that reflect the ecological environment quality of arid area. The principal component analysis (PCA) used the evaluating ecological environment quality of the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve to explore the characteristics of spatial differentiation for ecological quality in environment as indicated in the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The results showed that the greenness and wetness have positive effects on the ecological environment while the heat and dryness have negative effects. Wetness has a greater impact on the ecological environment than the other three indicators. The proportion of RSEI of degeneration, invariability, and improvement were 20.57%, 42.98%, 36.44%. Thus, the ecological environment had improved. The improved area in 2016 was once located in bad level in 2007. The ecological environment had degraded in the southern part of the lake. The value of Moran's I showed an increased trend first and then decreased. The value of Moran's I increased in 2013, in comparison with 2007, indicating a strong positive correlation and certain internal connection between the ecological environment qualifies in the study area. The spatial distribution was clustered rather than random. In comparison with 2013, the auto-correlation in 2016 was relatively weak, an indication that the spatial distribution was random and disperse. The area of High-High (HH) mostly reached to the significant level of 0.05 in 2007 and then to 0.01 in 2013 and 2016. This study offered important results and information for ecological environment protection and region planning.

TI  - The Impact of Pan-Sharpening and Spectral Resolution on Vineyard Segmentation through Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision viticulture benefits from the accurate detection of vineyard vegetation from remote sensing, without a priori knowledge of vine locations. Vineyard detection enables efficient, and potentially automated, derivation of spatial measures such as length and area of crop, and hence required volumes of water, fertilizer, and other resources. Machine learning techniques have provided significant advancements in recent years in the areas of image segmentation, classification, and object detection, with neural networks shown to perform well in the detection of vineyards and other crops. However, what has not been extensively quantitatively examined is the extent to which the initial choice of input imagery impacts detection/segmentation accuracy. Here, we use a standard deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and segment vineyards across Australia using DigitalGlobe Worldview-2 images at similar to 50 cm (panchromatic) and similar to 2 m (multispectral) spatial resolution. A quantitative assessment of the variation in model performance with input parameters during model training is presented from a remote sensing perspective, with combinations of panchromatic, multispectral, pan-sharpened multispectral, and the spectral Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) considered. The impact of image acquisition parameters-namely, the off-nadir angle and solar elevation angle-on the quality of pan-sharpening is also assessed. The results are synthesised into a 'recipe' for optimising the accuracy of vineyard segmentation, which can provide a guide to others aiming to implement or improve automated crop detection and classification.

Polygonal networks of ice-wedges drive environmental changes and feedback that will likely be exacerbated with future climate change. Recent decadal-scale observations have shown that ice-wedges are degrading rapidly within the entire Circum-Arctic Region but observations of feedback associated with ground temperature regimes are still lacking in many areas. We present over a year's worth of field observations from an area with cold (-16.5 degrees C), thick (>500 m) continuous permafrost and a mean annual air temperature of -19.7 degrees C in the Canadian high Arctic. Topographic surveys, thaw depths, vegetation cover, soil moisture, and annual shallow (12 cm) ground temperature measurements were collected for seven ice-wedge troughs and two polygon centers in a high-centered polygon system. We show that geomorphic changes caused by ice-wedge degradation generate new responses in soil moisture, vegetation cover, and snow distribution that create a mosaic of ground temperatures that range by 5.1 degrees C for mean annual, 2.5 degrees C in summer, and 15.2 degrees C in winter between polygon-centers and ice-wedge troughs. Our results show that snow redistribution due to wind induces the cooling of polygon centers, thus promoting new thermal contraction cracking and ice-wedge formation. We provide an example based on high-resolution remote sensing data on how these ice-wedge trough densities vary spatially in our study area. Capturing these fine scale geomorphic differences and resulting ground temperatures will be critical to accurately assess future changes of these common Arctic landscapes.

TI  - Assessing the shoreline dynamics of Hatiya Island of Meghna estuary in Bangladesh using multiband satellite imageries and hydro-meteorological data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hatiya is the largest and one of the most significant offshore islands in the Meghna river estuary. Which is very dynamic in nature as it is part of an active delta, where erosion and accretion process is active simultaneously. The present study attempts to assess the shoreline shifting and erosionaccretion measurement of Hatiya island and make an attempt to understand the impact of water level, temperature and rainfall on shoreline movement and erosion-accretion using GIS and remote sensing technique. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) extension for ArcGIS has been used for calculation of shoreline movement. Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) showed that the island is moving, the maximum seaward movement is 6.1 km and the maximum landward movement is about 12.62 km. In its addition, End Point Rate (EPR) is calculated for quantifying the shoreline shifting which revealed that maximum rate of seaward shifting is about 138.5 miyear and landward shifting rate is about 285.38 miyear. The island has shown its dynamic movement towards land in southern part while the seaward movement found in most other parts of the island. About 8 sq. km of land eroded in last 45 years and 1.62 km of shoreline has depleted during this period. The tidal flat is also showed a dynamic nature that is more active prior to the dominant land accretion. Hydro-meteorological data also showed that the local climate is changing and changes in rainfall and water level affect the erosion and accretion process. The DSAS technique is an effective tool for continuous monitoring of dynamics shorelines like Hatiya island. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modelling optical properties of atmospheric black carbon aerosols
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Review
AB  - The optical properties of atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosols are needed to model the direct radiative forcing of the climate system, as well as for interpreting and assimilating remote sensing observations from satellites. Modelling efforts during the past decade have predominantly been based on using morphologically highly realistic representations of the particle geometry in conjunction with numerically exact methods for solving the light-scattering problem. We review (i) the present state of knowledge about the morphological, dielectric, and compositional properties of BC aerosols, (ii) the state-of-the-art in numerical light-scattering methods frequently applied to black carbon, and (iii) the recent literature on modelling optical properties of BC aggregates, both bare and internally mixed with liquid-phase material. From this review we formulate some key lessons learned regarding those morphological properties that have a dominant impact on the optical properties. These morphological key features can form the basis for devising simplified model particles that can be used in large-scale applications. We illustrate this approach with one example appropriate for climate modelling, and one example relevant to the interpretation of lidar remote sensing data. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Satellite estimation of carbon export by sinking particles in the California Current calibrated with sediment trap data
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate a recent region-specific model of export production (Kelly a al., 2018) and some similar fits to in situ data for the California Current Ecosystem using satellite data. The model is a simple linear function of net primary productivity (NPP): Export = 0.08 x NPP + 72 where EF is export flux in mg C m(-2) d(-1). We confirm that contrary to several global algorithms export efficiency (e-ratio = export/primary productivity) is negatively correlated with net primary productivity. We find that linear models with a steeper slope of EF relative to NPP produce better estimates of the variability range. Choice of the EF model parameterization can more than double the estimate of temporal variability (standard deviation) in satellite-derived EF time series. The best estimates of EF were obtained when using average NPP during a preceding period of similar to 7-8 days. This is in contrast with NPP where the best satellite estimates of in situ NPP were obtained using same day satellite data and the coefficient of determination was monotonically decreasing with increasing time lag. We also find that there is substantial unexplained variability in EF that cannot be explained by existing models.

TI  - Global horizontal irradiance forecast for Finland based on geostationary weather satellite data
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) estimates and forecasts are necessary for the efficient use of a naturally fluctuating energy source like solar energy. However, few forecasting methods exist for high latitudes. In this study we present the development and validation of a satellite-based GHI forecast for southern Finland, called Solis-Heliosat. The forecast is formed by combining information from the clear sky (CS) model Pvlib Solis with consecutive geostationary weather satellite imagery, using the Heliosat method. Forecasts are produced up to 4 h with a 15-min temporal resolution. The CS model, the satellite-based all-sky estimate, and the GHI forecast have been compared and validated against other methods and in situ GHI measurements. An additional comparison was made for two datasets representing a changing cloud environment.The CS model estimates had an average rMBE (relative Mean Bias Error) of -6% to 1% and a rRMSE (relative Root Mean Square Error) of 6-10%. For the all-sky estimates the rMBE was -4% to -2%, and rRMSE 2-33%. With increasing forecast time the Solis-Heliosat rMBE descends to -9% and rRMSE reaches 50% at 4 h. Solis-Heliosat performs better than the persistence forecasts in most cases, particularly in a changing cloud environment.Our study indicates the use of satellite-based forecasts as a viable tool for forecasting GHI for the solar energy industry also in the high latitudes. In high latitudes geostationary satellite-based methods are at their limit; however, the information they can provide will enable efficient solar energy production.

TI  - Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy During Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy
T2  - ISTANBUL MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is the removal of the opposite breast with the aim of risk reduction in cases of unilateral breast carcinoma. Routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at the time of CPM is controversial due to low occult breast cancer risk. This study aims to determine the rate of occult breast carcinoma and to evaluate whether SLNB should be performed during CPM.Methods: Ninety-four patients who underwent CPM between 2009 and 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Occult breast carcinoma detection rate and approach to axilla were evaluated.Results: Occult invasive breast carcinoma was detected in three patients (3.2%): two invasive ductal carcinoma and one multifocal invasive lobular carcinoma. Axillary staging was performed in second session. SLNB was performed in two patients and a micro-metastasis in one of four sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) was detected in one patient. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in one patient in whom SLN was not detected.Conclusion: SLNB can be performed in patients with suspicious lesion in the absence of biopsy or in patients with high-risk of occult breast cancer (postmenopausal, high Gail score, lobular histology, multi-centric tumor, ipsilateral high-risk lesion); however, routine SLNB use during CPM is not recommended in patients with no risk. SLNB in second session by intradermic radioisotope injection in case of occult carcinoma can be an alternative solution to axillary staging.

TI  - Ship Wake Detection in SAR Images via Sparse Regularization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to analyze synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the sea surface, ship wake detection is essential for extracting information on the wake generating vessels. One possibility is to assume a linear model for wakes, in which case detection approaches are based on transforms such as Radon and Hough. These express the bright (dark) lines as peak (trough) points in the transform domain. In this article, ship wake detection is posed as an inverse problem, which the associated cost function including a sparsity enforcing penalty, i.e., the generalized minimax concave (GMC) function. Despite being a nonconvex regularizer, the GMC penalty enforces the overall cost function to be convex. The proposed solution is based on a Bayesian formulation, whereby the point estimates are recovered using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. To quantify the performance of the proposed method, various types of SAR images are used, corresponding to TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, Sentinel-1, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS2). The performance of various priors in solving the proposed inverse problem is first studied by investigating the GMC along with the $L_{1}$ , $L_{p}$ , nuclear, and total variation (TV) norms. We show that the GMC achieves the best results and we subsequently study the merits of the corresponding method in comparison to two state-of-the-art approaches for ship wake detection. The results show that our proposed technique offers the best performance by achieving 80% success rate.

TI  - Contour design to improve topographical and microstructural characteristics of Alloy 718 manufactured by electron beam-powder bed fusion technique
T2  - ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) processes are being frequently used in industry as they allow the manufacture of complex parts with reduced lead times. Electron beam-powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) as an AM technology is known for its near-net-shape production capacity with low residual stress. However, the surface quality and geometrical accuracy of the manufactured parts are major obstacles for the wider industrial adoption of this technology, especially when enhanced mechanical performance is taken into consideration. Identifying the origins of surface features such as satellite particles and sharp valleys on the parts manufactured by EB-PBF is important for a better understanding of the process and its capability. Moreover, understanding the influence of the contour melting strategy, by altering process parameters, on the surface roughness of the parts and the number of near-surface defects is highly critical. In this study, processing parameters of the EB-PBF technique such as scanning speed, beam current, focus offset, and number of contours (one or two) with the linear melting strategy were investigated. A sample manufactured using Arcam-recommended process parameters (three contours with the spot melting strategy) was used as a reference. For the samples with one contour, the scanning speed had the greatest effect on the arithmetical mean height (S-a), and for the samples with two contours, the beam current and focus offset had the greatest effect. For the samples with two contours, a lower focus offset and lower scan speed (at a higher beam current) resulted in a lower S-a; however, increasing the scan speed for the samples with one contour decreased S-a. In general, the samples with two contours provided a lower S-a (similar to 22 %) but with slightly higher porosity (similar to 8 %) compared to the samples with one contour. Fewer defects were detected with a lower scanning speed and higher beam current. The number of defects and the S-a value for the samples with two contours manufactured using the linear melting strategy were similar to 85 % and 16 %, respectively, lower than those of the reference samples manufactured using the spot melting strategy.

TI  - Quantitative Estimation of Soil Salinization in an Arid Region of the Keriya Oasis Based on Multidimensional Modeling
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the major factors causing land degradation and desertification on earth, especially its important damage to farming activities and land-use management in arid and semiarid regions. The salt-affected land is predominant in the Keriya River area of Northwestern China. Then, there is an urgent need for rapid, accurate, and economical monitoring in the salt-affected land. In this study, we used the electrical conductivity (EC) of 353 ground-truth measurements and predictive capability parameters of WorldView-2 (WV-2), such as satellite band reflectance and newly optimum spectral indices (OSI) based on two dimensional and three-dimensional data. The features of spectral bands were extracted and tested, and different new OSI and soil salinity indices using reflectance of wavebands were built, in which spectral data was pre-processed (based on First Derivative (R-FD), Second Derivative (R-SD), Square data (R-SQ), Reciprocal inverse (1/R), and Reciprocal First Derivative (1/R-FD)), utilizing the partial least-squares regression (PLSR) method to construct estimation models and mapping the regional soil-affected land. The results of this study are the following: (a) the new OSI had a higher relevance to EC than one-dimensional data, and (b) the cross-validation of established PLSR models indicated that the beta-PLSR model based on the optimal three-band index with different process algorithm performed the best result with R-V(2) = 0.79, Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEV) = 1.51 dSm(-1), and Relative Percent Deviation (RPD) = 2.01 and was used to map the soil salinity over the study site. The results of the study will be helpful for the study of salt-affected land monitoring and evaluation in similar environmental conditions.

TI  - Seasonality and Formation of Barrier Layers and Associated Temperature Inversions in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonality and formation of barrier layers (BLs) and associated temperature inversions (TIs) in the eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean were investigated using raw and gridded Argo profiling float data, satellite data, and various sea surface flux data. BLs were observed frequently in boreal summer and autumn along the sea surface salinity (SSS) front south of the eastern Pacific fresh pool. TIs were found within the gap between the western and eastern Pacific warm pools in autumn when BLs were thickest. A mixed layer salinity budget was constructed to determine the formation mechanism responsible for BLs with TIs. This budget revealed that Ekman advection works to both freshen and cool the eastern tropical North Pacific in autumn and contributes to the formation of the thickest BLs with the warmest TIs through the tilting of the SSS front. Precipitation is a secondary contributor to BL formation in autumn. The BLs are also prevalent during summer but are thinner, are without associated TIs, and are primarily formed through precipitation. The largest rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone mostly occurred north of the band of thickest BLs in both summer and autumn. The geostrophic advection of salinity did not coherently contribute to the formation of BLs or TIs. The idea that Ekman advection contributes most to the formation of the thickest BLs with warm TIs was further corroborated because the horizontal salinity gradient was the dominant contributor to the density gradient and so is favorable for BL and TI formation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the most important climatic implications of urbanization and thus a matter of key concern for environmentalists of the world in the twenty-first century. The relationship between climate and urbanization has been better understood with the introduction of thermal remote sensing. So, this study is an attempt to understand the influence of urbanization on local temperature for a small developing city. The study focuses on the investigation of intensity of atmospheric and surface urban heat island for a small urbanizing district of Punjab, India. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite data and field observations were used to examine the spatial pattern of surface and atmospheric UHI effect respectively, for the month of April, 2018. The satellite data has been used to cover the larger geographical area while field observations were taken for simultaneous and daily temperature measurements for different land use types. The significant influence of land use/land cover (LULC) patterns on UHI effect was analyzed using normalized built-up and vegetation indices (NDBI, NDVI) that were derived from remote sensing satellite data. The statistical analysis carried out for land surface temperature (LST) and LULC indicators displayed negative correlation for LST and NDVI while NDBI and LST exhibited positive correlation depicting attenuation in UHI effect by abundant vegetation. The comparison of remote sensing and in-situ observations were also carried out in the study. The research concluded in finding both nocturnal and daytime UHI effect based on diurnal air temperature observations. The study recommends the urgent need to explore and impose effective UHI mitigation measures for the sustainable urban growth.

TI  - Post-mastectomy radiation therapy in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes: No one size fits all
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is standard therapy for advanced breast cancer. However, given the lower risk of recurrence, PMRT administration remains controversial in select patients with limited nodal disease. We performed a review of the literature that focuses on the effect of PMRT in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes, mainly examining loco-regional recurrence (LRR) and overall survival (OS). Most studies, including a large meta-analysis by the EBCTCG, showed a significant improvement in LRR rates among patients receiving PMRT. While most studies demonstrated a trend towards OS improvement, only few studies showed a statistically significant OS or breast cancer-specific survival benefit for PMRT. As such, individualized treatment decisions are recommended, taking into consideration clinicopathological findings. Future studies with large sample sizes and long follow-up times are still needed to better assess the role of PMRT in patients with limited nodal involvement.

TI  - Quantifying smallholder farmers' managed land use/land cover dynamics and its drivers in contrasting agro-ecological zones of the East African Rift
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relationships between land use land cover (LULC) change and its drivers is essential for designing appropriate strategies for managing and conserving natural resources. This study examined the status, trends, and driving factors of smallholder farmers' managed land use land cover (LULC) dynamics over the past 30 years (1988e2018) in two contrasting agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of highly-populated Southeastern escarpments of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Changes in LULC were quantified by integrating field observation, remote-sensing data, and geographic information systems. Landsat images (1988, 2003, and 2018), household surveys (for drivers), and time-series data sources were used to generate the datasets. Results showed that: (1) the total area of 75,246.98 ha (33.79%) was non-linearly changed to various LULC classes. Cultivated land and agroforestry were dominant and increased in humid AEZ from 1988 to 2018. In the same period, waterbody, wetland/marshy, and grass/bushland were dominant and increased in semi-arid AEZ. Cultivated land increased remarkably at the expense of wetland/marshy, woodland, forestland, and grass/bushland in both humid and semi-arid AEZs, and, consequently, bare land was expanded by 1288% in the region. Agroforestry was highly persistent, while forestland was found to be highly susceptible to LULC change. (2) We observed that there was a spatial variation of drivers between humid and semi-arid AEZs. Population growth and landholding size (land fragmentation) were considered to be the main drivers of LULC changes in humid AEZ, while drought/rainfall variability and agricultural investment were the principal drivers in semi-arid AEZ. Ordinary least square (OLS) and binary logistic regression have also confirmed that population density and agricultural investment are the top drivers that significantly influence LULC classes. We conclude that unmanaged population growth, coupled with the continued expansion of cultivated land, have remarkably contributed to the expansion of bare land and decreases vegetation cover. Hence, improving farm-level participatory land-use management is required to recuperate the environment and smallholder farmers' well-being. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Operational Large-Area Land-Cover Mapping: An Ethiopia Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of land cover and land use nationally is a prerequisite of many studies on drivers of land change, impacts on climate, carbon storage and other ecosystem services, and allows for sufficient planning and management. Despite this, many regions globally do not have accurate and consistent coverage at the national scale. This is certainly true for Ethiopia. Large-area land-cover characterization (LALCC), at a national scale is thus an essential first step in many studies of land-cover change, and yet is itself problematic. Such LALCC based on remote-sensing image classification is associated with a spectrum of technical challenges such as data availability, radiometric inconsistencies within/between images, and big data processing. Radiometric inconsistencies could be exacerbated for areas, such as Ethiopia, with a high frequency of cloud cover, diverse ecosystem and climate patterns, and large variations in elevation and topography. Obtaining explanatory variables that are more robust can improve classification accuracy. To create a base map for the future study of large-scale agricultural land transactions, we produced a recent land-cover map of Ethiopia. Of key importance was the creation of a methodology that was accurate and repeatable and, as such, could be used to create earlier, comparable land-cover classifications in the future for the same region. We examined the effects of band normalization and different time-series image compositing methods on classification accuracy. Both top of atmosphere and surface reflectance products from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were tested for single-time classification independently, where the latter resulted in 1.1% greater classification overall accuracy. Substitution of the original spectral bands with normalized difference spectral indices resulted in an additional improvement of 1.0% in overall accuracy. Three approaches for multi-temporal image compositing, using Landsat 8 OLI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, were tested including sequential compositing, i.e., per-pixel summary measures based on predefined periods, probability density function compositing, i.e., per-pixel characterization of distribution of spectral values, and per-pixel sinusoidal models. Multi-temporal composites improved classification overall accuracy up to 4.1%, with respect to single-time classification with an advantage of the Landsat OLI-driven composites over MODIS-driven composites. Additionally, night-time light and elevation data were used to improve the classification. The elevation data and its derivatives improved classification accuracy by 1.7%. The night-time light data improve producer's accuracy of the Urban/Built class with the cost of decreasing its user's accuracy. Results from this research can aid map producers with decisions related to operational large-area land-cover mapping, especially with selecting input explanatory variables and multi-temporal image compositing, to allow for the creation of accurate and repeatable national-level land-cover products in a timely fashion.

AB  - This study analyzes the characteristics of land use/land cover change in Jordan's Irbid governorate, 1984-2018, and predicts future land use/land cover for 2030 and 2050 using a cellular automata-Markov model. The results inform planners and decision makers of past and current spatial dynamics of land use/land cover change and predicted urban expansion, for a better understanding and successful planning. Satellite images of Landsat 5-thematic mapper and Landsat 8 operational land imager for the years 1984, 1994, 2004, 2015 and 2018 were used to explore the characteristics of land use/land cover for this study. The results indicate that the built-up area expanded by 386.9% during the study period and predict further expansion by 19.5% and 64.6% from 2015 to 2030 and 2050 respectively. The areas around the central and eastern parts of the governorate are predicted to have significant expansion of the built-up area by these dates, which should be taken into consideration in future plans. Land use/land cover change and urban expansion in Irbid are primarily caused by the high rate of population growth rate as a direct result of receiving large numbers of immigrants from Syria and Palestine in addition to the natural increase of population and other socio-economic changes.

TI  - Simple-Yet-Effective SRTM DEM Improvement Scheme for Dense Urban Cities Using ANN and Remote Sensing Data: Application to Flood Modeling
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are crucial in flood modeling as DEM data reflects the actual topographic characteristics where water can flow in the model. However, a high-quality DEM is very difficult to acquire as it is very time consuming, costly, and, often restricted. DEM data from a publicly accessible satellite, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery are selected and used to train the artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the quality of SRTM's DEM. High-quality DEM is used as target data in the training of ANN. The trained ANN will then be ready to efficiently and effectively generate a high-quality DEM, at low cost, for places where ground truth DEM data is not available. In this paper, the performance of the DEM improvement scheme is evaluated over two dense urban cities, Nice (France) and Singapore; with the performance criteria using various matrices, e.g., visual clarity, scatter plots, root mean square error (RMSE) and flood maps. The DEM resulting from the improved SRTM (iSRTM) showed significantly better results than the original SRTM DEM, with about 38% RMSE reduction. Flood maps from iSRTM DEM show much more reasonable flood patterns than SRTM DEM's flood map.

TI  - Species- and elevation-dependent productivity changes in East Asian temperate forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The velocity and impact of climate change on forest appear to be site, environment, and tree species-specific. The primary objective of this research is to assess the changes in productivity of five major temperate tree species (Pinus densiflora, PD; Larix kaempferi, LK; Pinus koraiensis, PK; Quercus variabilis, QV; and Quercus mongolica, QM) in South Korea using terrestrial inventory and satellite remote sensing data. The area covered by each tree species was further categorized into either lowland forest (LLF) or high mountain forest (HMF) and investigated. We used the repeated Korean national forest inventory (NFI) data to calculate a stand-level annual increment (SAI). We then compared the SAI, a ground-based productivity measure, to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) net primary productivity as a measure of productivity based on satellite imagery. In addition, the growth index of each increment core, which eliminated the effect of tree age on radial growth, was derived as an indicator of the variation in primary productivity by tree species over the past four decades. Based on our result from NFI plots and increment core data sets, the productivity of PD, QV, and QM in LLF was relatively higher than those in HMF, while LK and PK in HMF were more productive than lowland ones. Our analysis of the increment core data revealed a contrasting pattern of long-term productivity changes between coniferous and oak tree species. While the productivity of oak tree species tended to increase after the 1990s, the productivity in coniferous forests tended to decrease. These differences across forest types and their altitudinal classes are also noticeable from the MODIS product. The results of our study can be used to develop climate-smart forest management strategies to ensure that the forests continue to be resilient and continue to provide a wide range of ecosystem services in the Eastern Asian region.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes between the one-step and two-step sentinel lymph node mapping techniques in endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionFluorescence image-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using a two-step mapping technique incorporates sequential injection of indocyanine green into the bilateral uterine cornus, followed by cervical injection. Outcomes were compared with the conventional cervical (one-step) method .MethodsPatients with FIGO stage I-III endometrial cancer who underwent laparoscopic or robotic staging, including SLN biopsy, from May 2014 to December 2018, were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics, pre-operative imaging, SLN detection pattern, pathologic result, adjuvant, and recurrence locations were analyzed.ResultsA total of 199 patients received one-step (n=123) and two-step (n=76) SLN biopsy. Para-aortic SLN were more frequently identified in the two-step group. Lower and upper para-aortic SLN were identified in 67.1% and 38.2%, respectively, in the two-step group and in 18.7% and 5.7% in the one-step group (p<0.001). The number of para-aortic SLN harvested was superior in the two-step group (p<0.001). Metastatic para-aortic SLN were found in 7.9% of the two-step group and 2.4% of the one-step group (p=0.070). In detecting nodal metastasis, the sensitivities of the one- and two-step methods were 91.7% and 100.0%, negative predictive values were 99.0% and 100.0%, false-negative rates were 8.3% and 0%, and accuracy rates were 99.1% and 100.0%, respectively. The one-step method identified only three out of eight para-aortic lymph node metastases and missed five para-aortic lymph node metastases. There was no missed para-aortic lymph node metastasis in the two-step group. Recurrence was observed in two patients (2.6%; vaginal vault and adrenal gland) in the two-step group and seven patients (5.7%) including three nodal recurrences in the one-step group (p=0.307).DiscussionTwo-step SLN mapping improved the para-aortic SLN detection rate, a known pitfall of conventional cervical injection. Proper evaluation of aortic nodal status will assist in the tailoring of adjuvant and prevent undertreatment of patients with isolated para-aortic metastasis.

TI  - Extraction of sub-pixel C3/C4 emissions of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) using artificial neural network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a signal directly and functionally related to photosynthetic activity and thus holds great promise for large-scale agricultural monitoring. However, the coarse spatial resolution of existing satellite SIF observations usually consist of mixed SIF signals contributed by different crop types with distinct phenology (modulated by management practices) and varying SIF emission capacities, which impedes effective utilization of existing SIF records for large-scale agricultural applications. This study makes the first effort to overcome this challenge by developing a sub-pixel SIF extraction framework for corn and soybean in the US Corn Belt as a case study. Here we developed a machine learning (ML) based sub-pixel SIF extraction framework using Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), whose high-resolution SIF acquired along orbits at nadir enables the identification of relatively pure pixels dominated by single corn or soybean crops, facilitating validation of the developed framework. To achieve this, we first generated artificially mixed SIF pixels from pure pixels randomly weighted by fractional area coverage. We then employed a standard feed forward artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate sub-pixel SIF for corn and soybean respectively, using the following predictors: total mixed SIF, spectral reflectance of corn/soybean (from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS), and the fractional area coverage of corn/soybean (derived from CropScape-Cropland Data Layer). Our results demonstrated that the estimated sub-pixel SIF could successfully reproduce the original pure SIF values constituting the mixed pixel, with a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of < 10% during the peak growing season. We further demonstrated that this ANN-based framework substantially outperforms the parsimonious linear extraction methods. This developed sub-pixel SIF extraction framework was then applied to generate regional-scale SIF maps for corn and soybean at 0.05 degrees in the US Midwest. Although tested for corn and soybean only, the developed framework has the potential to resolve subpixel SIF of more endmembers from coarse SIF observations.

TI  - Value Orientations: What Portrait of Modern Student is?
T2  - REVISTA SAN GREGORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of this article is conditioned by the need to study the life and choice of value orientations of modern youth, because it is through them that the self-consciousness of Russian students is formed. The values that a person learns in the process of his/her formation are broadcasted by the society in which the process of socialization of the person takes place. Because various social changes are currently taking place, we can safely say that the social value structure is somewhat blurred: it is unclear which values come to the fore and are dominant. The aim of the study is to analyze the terminal and instrumental values of modern students. As research methods, authors used: questionnaire survey and research technique of value orientations, allowing to explore the direction of the personality and determine his/her attitude to the world, to other people, to him/herself, the perception of the world, the key motives of actions, the basis of the worldview. Theoretical and methodological aspects of students' value orientations are considered in the article. Features of dependence between social and demographic characteristics, psychological climate in a family and value orientations of students are revealed. The influence of intensity of students' social contacts on their value orientations is considered. The novelty and originality of the study lies in the fact that the value orientations of modern students are studied. It is shown that among the terminal values the students give the greatest preference to the productivity of life, the fullest use of their capabilities, powers and abilities; self-confidence, inner harmony, freedom from internal contradictions, doubts; financially secure life, the absence of material problems. It is determined that the least preference students give to such values as the happiness of others, welfare, development and improvement of other people, the whole nation, humanity as a whole. It is revealed that the dominant positions in the list of instrumental values are occupied by such values as cheerfulness, optimism, sense of humor; efficiency in business, diligence, productivity in work; self-control, restraint, self-discipline. It is shown that students give the least preference to such values as honesty, truthfulness, and sincerity. It is revealed that students who spent most of their lives in the city, dominated by such value orientations as self-confidence, inner harmony, freedom from internal contradictions, doubts and courage in defending their opinions. It is determined that students who spent most of their lives in an urban-type settlement, the highest marks gave to such value orientations as: financially secure life, lack of material problems, breadth of views, the ability to understand someone else's point of view, respect of other tastes, customs, habits. It is revealed that both groups of students attach great importance to such values as productive life, the fullest use of their capabilities, powers and abilities, self-control, restraint, self-discipline. The data obtained in this work can be used in social psychology, pedagogy, age psychology, sociology, as well as for further theoretical development of this issue.

TI  - PSYCHOLINGUISTIC SECURITY OF THE STUDENT'S PERSONALITY AND ITS PROVISION IN THE PROCESS OF STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of psycholinguistic security of the student's personality in the conditions of digital transformation of the Russian society. The analysis of the state policy in the field of protection of the Russian language and culture is made. An overview of approaches to the definition of linguistic security in linguistics, psychology, philosophy, and cultural studies is presented. Socio-cultural threats to the psycholinguistic security of the individual are summarized: linguistic (related to the transformation of elements of language and culture: westernization, criminalization, simplification and replacement with a visual series, the spread of obscene vocabulary and Internet slang), socio-cultural (devaluation or discrediting of spiritual values), psychological (lowering the threshold of psychological suggestibility and dependence, erosion of personal identity, psychological distress), socio-psychological (distortion of ethnic and civil identity, destructive collective behavior). The purpose of the study was to study psycholinguistic culture and social identity as predictors of psycholinguistic security of the individual. To evaluate psycholinguistic culture a specially developed questionnaire was used, including scales "The socio-cultural and political role of the Russian language", "Threats to the Russian language", "Features of the modern language Internet environment", "Spoken language used". To measure the strength of social (ethnic, civil, global, macrosocial) identity, the modified method "Scale of identification with humanity" was used (S. Mcfarland, in the Russian-language adaptation of T.A. Nestik). The study involved 186 students from Russian universities. The obtained data were processed using the SPSS 23 statistical software package (descriptive statistics, pearson correlation analysis, linear regression analysis). The data obtained suggest that Russian students share the opinion about the importance of the socio-cultural functions of the Russian language. Every second respondent is aware that threats to the Russian language are Internet slang, profanity, westernization, and criminalization. Assessing the features of the modern language Internet environment, half of the students noted that it uses a simple, primitive language, a large amount of information that makes it difficult to perceive, distorts the meaning and meaning of words; a third of the respondents noted that the Internet environment distorts the worldview of a person, promotes Western culture, promotes violence and aggression. About half of the students use Internet slang and foreign words borrowed from other languages in their everyday conversational vocabulary. The study showed that modern Russian students identify themselves equally with representatives of humanity, Russian citizens and representatives of the Russian ethnic group. The study confirmed the fact that psycholinguistic security of the person in terms of digital transformation of the Russian society is provided by ethnic and civil identification, as well as interrelated indicators of psycholinguistic culture: the recognition of threats to the Russian language and risk language of the Internet, as well as use in the spoken vocabulary of the language means providing social and cultural identity. In conclusion, it is concluded that it is necessary to implement educational programs in the education system aimed at developing students ' psychological resources, protection and competence of psycholinguistic security of the individual.

TI  - eDaRT: The Ecosystem Disturbance and Recovery Tracker system for monitoring landscape disturbances and their cumulative effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldwide demand for timely and accurate information about ecosystem dynamics at Landsat spatial scale is growing and as of today still exceeds the availability of information. The diversity of required disturbance metrics and trade-offs between sensitivity, reliability, timelines of information generation, and flexibility toward potential customizations suggests that a single system is not likely to fill such demand in the near future. To address this challenge, the scientific community has been developing and improving various Landsat-based algorithms for land change monitoring. We describe the Ecosystem Disturbance and Recovery Tracker (eDaRT) version 2.9 - a highly automated prototype system in continuous development, which has been operated since 2012 by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region to generate most current disturbance maps at Landsat scale and provide customized information services and inputs to science and land management applications in the Region.The eDaRT processing system utilizes all three dimensions of dense Landsat image time series: spectral, temporal, and spatial. Two anomaly detection algorithms are sequentially applied, one estimating pixels' disturbance status metrics in every processed image and the other detecting disturbance events, the primary output of eDaRT. The first algorithm initially estimates change relative to a user-defined fixed baseline time period, using a stratified version of the Dynamic Detection Model (DDM; Koltunov et al., 2009) applied to Landsat bands and vegetation indexes that reflect canopy greenness, abundance, and moisture content. Using the model residuals and a probabilistic context analysis, the detected anomalies are further classified as disturbed, cloud/snow, or recovered. The resulting residuals, classification maps, and the associated disturbance confidence values provide the most rapid preliminary snapshot of the current cumulative effect of disturbance and regeneration. The second algorithm detects discrete disturbance events as regime changes in the dense time series of the residuals for each pixel. First, the residuals are compared against a recent baseline window and classified to find candidates for disturbance events. Next, candidate-events are accepted based on temporal consistency of their detection. The standard outputs from this algorithm include disturbance event timing (down to 8-16 day precision) and a detection confidence as a proxy for event magnitude.We initially evaluated eDaRT performance with high-resolution imagery and airborne LiDAR data in a test area in California for several types of annual disturbance events at 30-m scale. These tests modeled detection probabilities as functions of canopy cover loss, which estimated detection rates of 96%, 87% and 92% respectively for fire, harvest, and tree mortality events, when canopy loss values follow a uniform prior distribution. The error of commission varied between 10-20% for most forest types (12% on average). Following ongoing optimizations and extended validations, eDaRT will expand beyond Landsat instruments to improve ecosystem monitoring, as an independent system and potentially as a part of an ensemble method.

TI  - Long-Term Variability of Distortion-Product Otoacoustic Emissions in Infants and Children and Its Relation to Pediatric Ototoxicity Monitoring
T2  - EAR AND HEARING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) provide a rapid, noninvasive measure of outer hair cell damage associated with chemotherapy and are a key component of pediatric ototoxicity monitoring. Serial monitoring of DPOAE levels in reference to baseline measures is one method for detecting ototoxic damage. Interpreting DPOAE findings in this context requires that test-retest differences be considered in relation to normal variability, data which are lacking in children. This study sought to (1) characterize normal test-retest variability in DPOAE level over the long time periods reflective of pediatric chemotherapy regimens for a variety of childhood ages and f2 primary frequencies using common clinical instrumentation and stimulus parameters; (2) develop level-shift reference intervals; and (3) account for any age-related change in DPOAE level or measurement error that may occur as the auditory system undergoes maturational change early in life.Design:Serial DPOAE measurements were obtained in 38 healthy children (25 females and 13 males) with normal hearing and ranging in age from one month to 10 years at the initial (baseline) visit. On average, children were tested 5.2 times over an observation period of 6.5 months. Data were collected in the form of DP grams, in which DPOAE level was measured for f2 ranging from 1.4 to 10 kHz, using a fixed f2/f1 ratio of 1.22 and stimulus level of 65/55 dB SPL for L1/L2. Age effects on DPOAE level and measurement error were estimated using Bayesian regression of the longitudinal data. The raw and model-based distribution of DPOAE test-retest differences were characterized using means and standard error of the measurement for several ages and f2's.Results:DPOAE test-retest differences for the children in this study are at the high end of those previously observed in adults, as reflected in the associated shift reference intervals. Further, although we observe substantial child-specific variation in DPOAE level, the pattern of age-related changes is highly consistent across children. Across a wide range of f2's, DPOAE level decreases by 3 to 4 dB from 1 to 13 months of age followed by a more gradual decline of <1 dB/year. An f2 of 6 kHz shows the smallest decrease during the early rapid maturation period. DPOAE measurement error is fairly constant with age. It is 3 to 4 dB at most f2's and is greater (indicating poorer reliability) at 1.5, 8, and 10 kHz.Conclusions:DPOAE level decreases with childhood age, with the greatest changes observed in the first year of life. Maturational effects during infancy and greater measurement error at very low and high f2's affect test-retest variability in children. An f2 of 6 kHz shows minimal maturation and measurement error, suggesting it may be an optimal sentinel frequency for ototoxicity monitoring in pediatric patients. Once validated with locally developed normative data, reference intervals provided herein could be used to determine screen fail criteria for serial monitoring using DPOAEs. Employing state-of-the-art calibration techniques might reduce variability, allowing for more sensitive screen fail criteria.

AB  - The sentinel effect posits that the perception of increased oversight is associated with improved behavior. We consider the association between enhanced government oversight and financial reporting aggressiveness in the healthcare industry. Specifically, we examine the association between criminal cases (pending cases and successful cases) against healthcare providers and the quality of subjective accounts that require significant judgment and have been shown to be linked to healthcare earnings management-revenue accruals and the allowance for doubtful accounts. We find that heightened government oversight is associated with lower financial reporting aggressiveness.

We examine recent advances in remote sensing technology, focusing on the latency, historical availability and spatial and temporal scales of the data these satellites provide. Because of their global coverage, seven variables derived from satellite observations emerge as especially pertinent to drought and famine: precipitation (TRMM/GPM), groundwater (GRACE/GRACE-FO), snow (MODIS), soil moisture (SMOS, SMAP, Sentinel-1), evapotranspiration (MODIS, ECOSTRESS), vegetation health (Landsat, AVHRR, MODIS, SPOT) and chlorophyll fluorescence (OCO-2). We discuss tipping point theory as a possible framework for taking advantage of long time series of these satellite data where they exist in order to enhance the effectiveness of existing famine early warning systems.

TI  - Detecting Land Abandonment in Lodz Voivodeship Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide availability of multispectral satellite imagery through projects such as Landsat and Sentinel, combined with the introduction of deep learning in general and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular, has allowed for the rapid and effective analysis of multiple classes of problems pertaining to land coverage. Taking advantage of the two phenomena, we propose a machine learning model for the classification of land abandonment. We designed a Convolutional Neural Network architecture that outputs a classification probability for the presence of land abandonment in a given 15-25 ha grid element by using multispectral imaging data obtained through Sentinel Hub. For both the training and validation of the model, we used imagery of the Lodz Voivodeship in central Poland. The main source of truth was a 2009 orthophoto study available from the WMS (Web Map Service) of the Geoportal site. The model achieved 0.855 auc (area under curve), 0.47 loss, and 0.78 accuracy for the test dataset. Using the classification results and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, we prepared a map of cold- and hotspots with individual areas that exceed 50 km(2). This thresholded heatmap allowed for an analysis of contributing factors for both low and intense land abandonment, demonstrating that common trends are identifiable through the interpretation of the classification results of the chosen model. We additionally performed a comparative field study on two selected cold- and hotspots. The study, along with the high-accuracy results of the model's validation, confirms that CNN-type models are an effective tool for the automatic detection of land abandonment.

TI  - Landsat 8 Virtual Orange Band for Mapping Cyanobacterial Blooms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has a panchromatic band (503-676 nm) that can be used to derive a novel virtual orange band (590-635 nm) by using the multispectral green band and red band components. The orange band is useful for the accurate detection and quantification of phycocyanin (PC), an accessory pigment in toxin-producing cyanobacterial blooms, because of the specific light absorption characteristics of PC around 600-625 nm. In this study, we compared the Landsat 8 OLI's and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument's (OLCI) derived orange band reflectance and PC products corresponding to a same-date overpass during a severe cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Erie, USA. The goal was to determine if the OLI's virtual orange band can produce results equivalent to the OLCI's actual orange band. Band-by-band match-ups used the OLI's top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance versus TOA reflectance from the OLCI, and surface reflectance (SR) from the OLI versus SR from the OLCI. A significant correlation was observed between the OLI's and OLCI's derived orange band TOA reflectance (R-2 = 0.86; p < 0.001; NRMSE = 9.01%) and orange band SR (R-2 = 0.93; p < 0.001; NRMSE = 20.23%). The PC map produced using the best-fit empirical models from both sensors showed similar PC spatial patterns and concentration levels in the western basin of Lake Erie. The results from this research are particularly important for the study of smaller inland waterbodies with the 30 m resolution of the OLI, which cannot be studied with the 300 m resolution of OLCI data, and for analyzing historical bloom events before the launch of the OLCI. Although more analysis and validation need to be conducted, this study opens up Landsat 8's applicability in research on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs).

TI  - Lake Inventory and Evolution of Glacial Lakes in the Nubra-Shyok Basin of Karakoram Range
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The trends of glacier lake evolution during the past few decades and their future development are still not well understood. The aim of the present study is to investigate the growth and changes in moraine and bed rock dammed glacier lakes of the Nubra and Shyok basin, Karakoram Range using multi-temporal satellite images. The glacier lake inventory is based on Landsat 7 and 8 (15 m spatial resolution), and Sentinels 2A (10 m spatial resolution) satellite imageries. The data revealed that during the years 2002-2017, the number of glacial lakes increased from 215 to 255. The glacial lake area also increased from similar to 9.0 km(2) in 2003 to similar to 9.36 km(2) in 2013 and similar to 11.27 km(2) in 2017. During 2002-2017, the lake area increased by similar to 2.27 km(2), out of which similar to 1.9 km(2) increase is recorded between 2013 and 2017 accounts for almost 84% of the total increase. The lakes with an area of >= 0.2 km(2) have been considered for glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) susceptibility studies and volume estimation. Analyses of the data show a progressive increase in number of glacial lakes and their areal extent. This study would help planners to minimize the adverse effects of GLOF in the Nubra-Shyok basin.

TI  - Water Quality of River Beas, India, and Its Correlation with Reflectance Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River Beas originates in the Himalayas in Central Himachal Pradesh, and merges with river Sutlej at Harike in the state of Punjab and this river is a habitat of the endangered freshwater dolphin, Platanista gangetica minor R. The pollution of water bodies is a significant environmental jeopardy as the river is the prime source of water for the consumption by human beings and aquatic species residing in the river. The water quality indices (WQI) of the river Beas using nine standard parameters recommended by National Sanitation Foundation, were determined for pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and winter seasons at three sampling sites between the towns of Beas and Harike over a stretch of 63 km. The results of WQI of river Beas at Harike before confluence with river Sutlej and at Goindwal Sahib is superior to those at the Beas bridge. This is due to self-purification of the water downstream from Beas bridge to Harike. Season-wise, water quality during the pre-monsoon season was somewhat superior at Harike and Beas. This is attributed to fast degradation of organic matter in river during the summer season. Bioassay for appraising the toxicity of river water was also determined by using Girardinus guppii fish and their results indicate that the water of river Beas is not toxic. Toxicity bioassay using Girardinus guppii fish indicates that the water of river Beas is not toxic. Digital number (DN) values of the river water were obtained from Landsat-TM imagery. PO43-, TDS and turbidity of the river water were regressed on the reflectance values. Using multiple and beta-regression analysis, it was found that PO43-, TDS and turbidity contribute positively to band 2(G) and negatively to band 3(R). Multiple linear regression and beta-regression analysis showed that PO43- and turbidity are regressed on the normalized difference water index negatively and positively respectively. Correlations between the target and output values from artificial neural network for PO43-, TDS and turbidity were highly significant. It is suggested that removal strategies like introduction of aquatic phytoremediation plants must be involved in land management policies in order to mitigate the anthropogenic jeopardy. We affirm that the significance of applying water quality management tools using nature dependent solutions and well-organized management policies.

TI  - <i>A Writer's Diary</i> by F. M. Dostoevsky as a subject of axiological psycholinguistics
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers the possibility of applying an axiologically oriented interdisciplinary psycholinguistic method to the analysis of A Writer's Diary by F. M. Dostoevsky, a periodical bestseller of the 1860-70s. Warmly received by contemporaries, A Writer's Diary became almost an outcast in the next century. For decades, it was overlooked by scientists until a comprehensive historical and philological research, undertaken by I. L. Volgin, caused a new wave of scientific interest to it. The analysis of A Writer's Diary provides insight into value-oriented meanings of the author's consciousness, which were relevant not only for Russia of the second half of the 19th century but also for contemporary society given the social challenges and psychological problems of the personality associated with the loss of values. The gospel ideals that formed the basis of Dostoyevsky's ideology never fade when it concerns searching for the "super sense" of life. The writer's method, whose life experience, worldview, and numerous insights are embodied in A Writer's Diary, finds a response in the modern approaches of the existential analysis of V. Frankl and Christian or "moral" psychology. These approaches extend the methodology of psycholinguistics in axiological dimension. Some common features between new psychological approaches and the method of Dostoyevsky can be revealed: a personal approach, the openness of a personality to the future, axiological approach, the opposition of morality and utilitarianism, etc.

TI  - Phenology-Based Mapping of an Alien Invasive Species Using Time Series of Multispectral Satellite Data: A Case-Study with Glossy Buckthorn in Quebec, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus Mill.) is an alien species in Canada that is invading many forested areas. Glossy buckthorn has impacts on the biodiversity and productivity of invaded forests. Currently, we do not know much about the species' ecology and no thorough study of its distribution in temperate forests has been performed yet. As is often the case with invasive plant species, the phenology of glossy buckthorn differs from that of other indigenous plant species found in invaded communities. In the forests of eastern Canada, the main phenological difference is a delay in the shedding of glossy buckthorn leaves, which occurs later in the fall than for other indigenous tree species found in that region. Therefore, our objective was to use that phenological characteristic to map the spatial distribution of glossy buckthorn over a portion of southern Quebec, Canada, using remote sensing-based approaches. We achieved this by applying a linear temporal unmixing model to a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to create a map of the probability of the occurrence of glossy buckthorn for the study area. The map resulting from the temporal unmixing model shows an agreement of 69% with field estimates of glossy buckthorn occurrence measured in 121 plots distributed over the study area. Glossy buckthorn mapping accuracy was limited by evergreen species and by the spectral and spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 OLI.

TI  - Clinical significance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers expression in the micrometastatic sentinel lymph node of NSCLC
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Metastatic lymph node affectation is the main prognostic factor in localised lung cancer. However, the pathological study of lymph nodes reveals tumour relapse for 20% of patients after oncological curative surgery. Recently, EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) has been established as one of the main factors related to lymphatic dissemination and metastasis. This study evaluated the prognostic value of EMT-related gene expression in micrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods The presence of genes CDH1, CDH2, VIM, TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 in mRNA was analysed in tumours and in the SLN of NSCLC patients for whom surgery was planned for treatment. The significant association between the expression level of EMT-related markers and patients' clinicopathological characteristics and relapse was assessed. Results Of the 96 patients, 56 (58.33%) presented molecular micrometastasis in SLN, which showed higher CDH1, CDH2, and VIM expressions than non-micrometastatic ones. An association linking a low CDH1/CDH2 ratio in SLN with molecular micrometastasis, adenocarcinoma, and non-smoking patients was found. The multivariate Cox regression analysis proved the prognostic accuracy of the CDH1/CDH2 ratio in SLN. Conclusions The molecular EMT status of SLN could be used as an independent prognosis predictor in early stage NSLCL patients, and as a new tool to better stratify and predict patient outcomes.

TI  - Responses of Seasonal Indicators to Extreme Droughts in Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant impact of extreme droughts on human society and ecosystem has occurred in many places of the world, for example, Southwest China (SWC). Considerable research concentrated on analyzing causes and effects of droughts in SWC, but few studies have examined seasonal indicators, such as variations of surface water and vegetation phenology. With the ongoing satellite missions, more and more earth observation data become available to environmental studies. Exploring the responses of seasonal indicators from satellite data to drought is helpful for the future drought forecast and management. This study analyzed the seasonal responses of surface water and vegetation phenology to drought in SWC using the multi-source data including Seasonal Water Area (SWA), Permanent Water Area (PWA), Start of Season (SOS), End of Season (EOS), Length of Season (LOS), precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, evapotranspiration, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and data from water conservancy construction. The results showed that SWA and LOS effectively revealed the development and recovery of droughts. There were two obvious drought periods from 2000 to 2017. In the first period (from August 2003 to June 2007), SWA decreased by 11.81% and LOS shortened by 5 days. They reduced by 21.04% and 9 days respectively in the second period (from September 2009 to June 2014), which indicated that there are more severe droughts in the second period. The SOS during two drought periods delayed by 3 similar to 6 days in spring, while the EOS advanced 1 similar to 3 days in autumn. All of PDSI, SWA and LOS could reflect the period of droughts in SWC, but the LOS and PDSI were very sensitive to the meteorological events, such as precipitation and temperature, while the SWA performed a more stable reaction to drought and could be a good indicator for the drought periodicity. This made it possible for using SWA in drought forecast because of the strong correlation between SWA and drought. Our results improved the understanding of seasonal responses to extreme droughts in SWC, which will be helpful to the drought monitoring and mitigation for different seasons in this ecologically fragile region.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Different Methods for Extracting Water Body Area of Miyun Reservoir and Driving Forces for Nearly 40 Years
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Miyun Reservoir is the most important source of drinking water in Beijing, China. Based on the Landsat satellite series image, this paper compared four index methods (NDWI, RNDWI, MNDWI, AWEIsh-superimposed MNDWI) to extract the water body area of Miyun Reservoir from 1979 to 2018 to study its changes in the past 40 years. Furthermore, the internal and external driving forces of reservoir water body area change are studied by correlation analysis and catastrophe analysis. Compared to the characteristic curve of reservoir area calculation, it indicated that the AWEIsh-superimposed MNDWI method has the highest accuracy. The statistical, temporal and spatial analysis showed that the water body area changes of Miyun Reservoir are mainly divided into four distinct stages: (1) It increased in 1979-1997, which was mainly due to the increase in precipitation and the low level of economic development. In 1997, the maximum value (161.14 km(2)) was reached, which was 108.64 km(2) higher than the minimum value. (2) It shrank rapidly in 1997-2004. The areas had dropped by 101.61 km(2). By 2004, it was 59.61 km(2). The main reason is that the reservoir has suffered from persistent drought for many years after discharging water. (3) It maintained at a lower water level in 2004-2015, with an average annual area of 78 km(2). The reason is the low precipitation and rapid economic development. (4) It grew rapidly after 2015, mainly due to water from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project, coupled with the increased precipitation. By 2018, the water body area reached 125.42 km(2).

TI  - Application of remote sensing technique for shoreline change detection in Ninh Binh and Nam Dinh provinces (Vietnam) during the period 1988 to 2018 based on water indices
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent years, the Ninh Binh and Nam Dinh shoreline had a strong fluctuation due to the impact of natural conditions and economic activity of people. Therefore, the monitoring of shoreline changes is very important for coastal manage in the context of climate change today. In this study, a total of 5 scenes of Landsat 5 TM and 01 scene of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images from 1988 to 2018 were used to extract shoreline based on water indices, such as Automated Extraction Water Index (AWEI(sh), AWEI(nsh)), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized DifferenceWater Index (MNDWI). Assessing the accuracy of automatically extracted shorelines on Ninh Binh and Nam Dinh coastal from Landsat data show that, the accuracy of shoreline extraction using AWEIsh index is higher than using other water indices, which is reflected in the comparison of mean square error (MSE) and Kappa values. The results show that the coastline of Nam Dinh area tends to erode in the period 1988-2018, in which the most eroded length amounted to 987 m. Meanwhile, the coastal area of Ninh Binh province is strongly accreted, with the lengths of accretion amounted to several kilometers in period 1988-2018. The results obtained in the study provide timely informations to help managers on monitoring and protecting coastlines and coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Estimation of the Particulate Organic Carbon to Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Ratio Using MODIS-Aqua in the East/Japan Sea, South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the change of marine environment due to climate change and declining primary productivity have been big concerns in the East/Japan Sea, Korea. However, the main causes for the recent changes are still not revealed clearly. The particulate organic carbon (POC) to chlorophyll-a (chl-a) ratio (POC:chl-a) could be a useful indicator for ecological and physiological conditions of phytoplankton communities and thus help us to understand the recent reduction of primary productivity in the East/Japan Sea. To derive the POC in the East/Japan Sea from a satellite dataset, the new regional POC algorithm was empirically derived with in-situ measured POC concentrations. A strong positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.6579) was observed between the estimated and in-situ measured POC concentrations. Our new POC algorithm proved a better performance in the East/Japan Sea compared to the previous one for the global ocean. Based on the new algorithm, long-term POC:chl-a ratios were obtained in the entire East/Japan Sea from 2003 to 2018. The POC:chl-a showed a strong seasonal variability in the East/Japan Sea. The spring and fall blooms of phytoplankton mainly driven by the growth of large diatoms seem to be a major factor for the seasonal variability in the POC:chl-a. Our new regional POC algorithm modified for the East/Japan Sea could potentially contribute to long-term monitoring for the climate-associated ecosystem changes in the East/Japan Sea. Although the new regional POC algorithm shows a good correspondence with in-situ observed POC concentrations, the algorithm should be further improved with continuous field surveys.

TI  - An Atmospheric Correction Using High Resolution Numerical Weather Prediction Models for Satellite-Borne Single-Channel Mid-Wavelength and Thermal Infrared Imaging Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a single-channel atmospheric correction method for remotely sensed infrared (wavelength of 3-15 mu m) images with various observation angles. The method is based on basic radiative transfer equations with a simple absorption-focused regression model to calculate the optical thickness of each atmospheric layer. By employing a simple regression model and re-organization of atmospheric profiles by considering viewing geometry, the proposed method conducts atmospheric correction at every pixel of a numerical weather prediction model in a single step calculation. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imaging channel (375 m) I4 (3.55 similar to 3.93 mu m) and I5 (10.50 similar to 12.40 mu m) bands were used as mid-wavelength and thermal infrared images to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed single-channel atmospheric correction method. The estimated sea surface temperatures (SSTs) obtained by the proposed method with high resolution numerical weather prediction models were compared with sea-truth temperature data from ocean buoys, multichannel-based SST products from VIIRS/MODIS, and results from MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5), for validation. High resolution (1.5 km and 12 km) numerical weather prediction (NWP) models distributed by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) were employed as input atmospheric data. Nighttime SST estimations with the I4 band showed a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.95 degrees C, similar to that of the VIIRS product (RMSE: 0.92 degrees C) and lower than that of the MODIS product (RMSE: 1.74 degrees C), while estimations with the I5 band showed an RMSE of 1.81 degrees C. RMSEs from MODTRAN simulations were similar (within 0.2 degrees C) to those of the proposed method (I4: 0.81 degrees C, I5: 1.67 degrees C). These results demonstrated the competitive performance of a regression-based method using high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for atmospheric correction of single-channel infrared imaging sensors.

TI  - Interferometric SAR for Wetland Hydrology: An Overview of Methods, Challenges, and Trends
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2000, interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) has been an effective tool to map 2D water-level changes beneath vegetated wetlands with a high spatial resolution and centimetric accuracy. In the last two decades, SAR images obtained from different wavelengths and polarization modes have been tested across various wetland systems, and InSAR-derived water-level-change maps have improved our understanding of wetland hydrology and hydraulics. In this article, we discuss the feasibility and challenges of applying InSAR to wetland areas, present a comprehensive review of InSAR applications for hydraulic and hydrologic analysis, and discuss future trends.

TI  - Spatial cluster detection of regression coefficients in a mixed-effects model
T2  - ENVIRONMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying spatial clusters of different regression coefficients is a useful tool for discerning the distinctive relationship between a response and covariates in space. Most of the existing cluster detection methods aim to identify the spatial similarity in responses, and the standard cluster detection algorithm assumes independent spatial units. However, the response variables are spatially correlated in many environmental applications. We propose a mixed-effects model for spatial cluster detection that takes spatial correlation into account. Compared to a fixed-effects model, the introduced random effects explain extra variability among the spatial responses beyond the cluster effect, thus reducing the false positive rate. The developed method exploits a sequential searching scheme and is able to identify multiple potentially overlapping clusters. We use simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed method in terms of the true and false positive rates of a known cluster and the identification of multiple known clusters. We apply our proposed methodology to particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from the Northeastern United States in order to study the weather effect on PM2.5 and to investigate the association between the simulations from a numerical model and the satellite-derived aerosol optical depth data. We find geographical hot spots that show distinct features, comparing to the background.

TI  - Mapping Forest Vertical Structure in Gong-ju, Korea Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As global warming accelerates in recent years, the frequency of droughts has increased and water management at the national level has become very important. In particular, accurate understanding and management of the forest is essential as the water storage capacity of forest is determined by forest structure. Typically, data on forest vertical structure have been constructed from field surveys that are both costly and time-consuming. In addition, machine learning techniques could be applied to analyze, classify, and predict the uncertainties of internal structures in forest. Therefore, this study aims to map the forest vertical structure for estimating forest water storage capacity from multi-seasonal optical satellite image and topographic data using artificial neural network (ANN) in Gongju-si, South Korea. For this purpose, the 14 input neurons of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), two types of normalized difference water index (NDWI), two types of Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDre), principal component analysis (PCA) texture, and canopy height average and standard deviation maps were generated from Sentinel-2 optical images obtained in spring and fall season and topographic height maps such as digital terrain models (DTM) and digital surface models (DSM). The training/validation and test datasets for the ANN model were derived from forest vertical structures based on field surveys. Finally, the forest vertical classification map, the result of ANN application, was evaluated by creating an error matrix compared with the field survey results. The result showed an overall test accuracy of similar to 65.7% based on the number of pixels. The result shows that forest vertical structure in Gong-ju, Korea can be efficiently classified by using multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 satellite images and the ANN approach.

TI  - Mapping Forest Vertical Structure in Jeju Island from Optical and Radar Satellite Images Using Artificial Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, due to the acceleration of global warming, an accurate understanding and management of forest carbon stocks, such as forest aboveground biomass, has become very important. The vertical structure of the forest, which is the internal structure of the forest, was mainly investigated by field surveys that are labor intensive. Recently, remote sensing techniques have been actively used to explore large and inaccessible areas. In addition, machine learning techniques that could classify and analyze large amounts of data are being used in various fields. Thus, this study aims to analyze the forest vertical structure (number of tree layers) to estimate forest aboveground biomass in Jeju Island from optical and radar satellite images using artificial neural networks (ANN). For this purpose, the eight input neurons of the forest related layers, based on remote sensing data, were prepared: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), NDVI texture, NDWI texture, average canopy height, standard deviation canopy height and two types of coherence maps were created using the Kompsat-3 optical image, L-band ALOS PALSAR-1 radar images, digital surface model (DSM), and digital terrain model (DTM). The forest vertical structure data, based on field surveys, was divided into the training/validation and test data and the hyper-parameters of ANN were trained using the training/validation data. The forest vertical classification result from ANN was evaluated by comparison to the test data. It showed about a 65.7% overall accuracy based on the error matrix. This result shows that the forest vertical structure map can be effectively generated from optical and radar satellite images and existing DEM and DTM using the ANN approach, especially for national scale mapping.

TI  - Extracting Agronomic Information from SMOS Vegetation Optical Depth in the US Corn Belt Using a Nonlinear Hierarchical Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing observations that vary in response to plant growth and senescence can be used to monitor crop development within and across growing seasons. Identifying when crops reach specific growth stages can improve harvest yield prediction and quantify climate change. Using the Level 2 vegetation optical depth (VOD) product from the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, we retrospectively estimate the timing of a key crop development stage in the United States Corn Belt. We employ nonlinear curves nested within a hierarchical modeling framework to extract the timing of the third reproductive development stage of corn (R3) as well as other new agronomic signals from SMOS VOD. We compare our estimates of the timing of R3 to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) survey data for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. We find that 87%, 70%, and 37%, respectively, of our model estimates of R3 timing agree with USDA district-level observations. We postulate that since the satellite estimates can be directly linked to a physiological state (the maximum amount of plant water, or water contained within plant tissue per ground area) it is more accurate than the USDA data which is based upon visual observations from roadways. Consequently, SMOS VOD could be used to replace, at a finer resolution than the district-level USDA reports, the R3 data that has not been reported by the USDA since 2013. We hypothesize the other model parameters contain new information about soil and crop management and crop productivity that are not routinely collected by any federal or state agency in the Corn Belt.

TI  - Skill Assessment of an Atmosphere-Wave Regional Coupled Model over the East China Sea with a Focus on Typhoons
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study performed several sensitivity experiments to investigate the impact of atmosphere-wave coupling on the simulated wind and waves over the East China Sea (ECS) with a focus on typhoon events. These experiments include stand-alone regional atmosphere model (CCLM) simulations, stand-alone spectral wave model (WAM) simulations driven by the regional atmospheric model CCLM or ERA5 reanalysis, and two-way (CCLM-WAM) coupled simulations. We assessed the simulated wind speed and significant wave height against in situ observations and remote sensing data and focused on typhoon events in 2010. We analyzed the differences between the experiments in capturing the surface pressure, wind speed, and roughness length. Both ERA5 reanalysis data and our regional model simulations demonstrate high quality in capturing wind and wave conditions over the ECS. The results show that downscaled simulations tend to be closer to in situ observations than ERA5 reanalysis data in capturing wind variability and probability distribution, dominant wind and wave directions, strong typhoon intensity and related extreme significant wave height. In comparison with satellite observations, the CCLM-WAM simulation outperforms the CCLM in reducing wind bias. The coupled and uncoupled simulations are very similar in terms of other wind and wave statistics. Though there is much improvement in capturing typhoon intensity to ERA5, regional downscaled simulations still underestimate the wind intensity of tropical cyclones.

TI  - Himawari-8-Derived Aerosol Optical Depth Using an Improved Time Series Algorithm Over Eastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8 (H8), as a new generation geostationary meteorological satellite, has great potential for monitoring the spatial-temporal variation of aerosol properties. However, the large amount of spectral data with differing observation geometries require re-formulation of the surface reflectance correction to utilize this new satellite data. This is achieved by using an improved version of the time series (TS) technique proposed by Mei et al., (2012) based on the assumption that the ratio of the surface reflectance in different spectral bands does not change between any two scan times within an hour. In addition, more suitable aerosol models were adopted, based on cluster analysis of local Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. The improved TS algorithm (ITS) was applied to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over eastern China and the results compare favorably with collocated reference AOD data at eleven sun photometer sites (R > 0.8, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) < 0.2). Comparison with the H8 official AOD product and with MODIS Dark Target (DT)-Deep Blue (DB) combined AOD data shows the good performance of the ITS method for AOD retrieval with different observation angles.

TI  - Analysis and Accuracy Evaluation of Scattering Characteristics of GF-3 Full-Polarized SAR
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, the scattering characteristics of GF-3 full-polarization SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images were evaluated based on H/A/alpha polarization decomposition method, and the polarization characteristics of typical ground features in GF-3 and RADARSAT-2 full-polarization SAR images were analyzed. Evaluation method of polarization measurement accuracy based on traditional H/alpha characteristic scattering plane and improved intra-class aggregation and inter-class dispersion were proposed. Results show that the polarization scattering characteristics of GF-3 full-polarization SAR arc clearly for different types of surface features. The average deviations of scattering entropy and scattering angle of three types of surface features arc approximately 0. 101 and 6. 923, respectively, which is better than that of RADARSAT-2 (0. 132 and 7.206, respectively). Based on the evaluation method of H/alpha characteristic scattering plane, the overall polarization accuracy of GF-3 and RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR is similar, both of which arc approximately 0. 7. According to the combined factors of intra-class aggregation and inter-class dispersion, the combined factors of GF-3 arc 85. 34 (water bodies), 28. 99 (buildings), and 122. 72 (plants). The recognition ability of GF-3 full-polarization SAR images for these three typical features is similar to that of RADARSAT-2. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of ground features with different scattering mechanisms and find that the co-polarization measurement accuracy of GF-3 full-polarization SAR is similar to that of RADARSAT-2 but the cross-polarization channel accuracy is slightly worse than that of RADARSAT-2.

TI  - The Long-Term Change of Latent Heat Flux over the Western Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has been experiencing warming and wetting since the 1980s. Under such circumstances, we estimated the summer latent heat flux (LE) using the maximum entropy production model driven by the net radiation, surface temperature, and soil moisture of three reanalysis datasets (ERA5, JRA-55, and MERRA-2) at the Ali site over the western TP during 1980-2018. Compared with the observed LE of the Third Tibetan Plateau Atmospheric Scientific Experiment, the coefficient of determination, root-mean-square error, and mean bias error of the estimated summer LE are 0.57, 9.3 W m(-2), and -2.25 W m(-2) during 2014-2016, respectively, which are better than those of LE of the reanalysis datasets. The estimated long-term summer LE presents a decreasing (an increasing) trend of -7.4 (1.8) W m(-2) decade(-1) during 1980-1991 (1992-2018). The LE variation is closely associated with the local soil moisture influenced by precipitation, glacier, and near-surface water conditions at the Ali site. The summer soil moisture also presents a decreasing (an increasing) trend of -0.082 (0.022) decade(-1) during 1980-1991 (1992-2018). The normalized difference vegetation index generally shows the consistent trend with LE at the Ali site.

TI  - Long-Term (2005-2017) View of Atmospheric Pollutants in Central China Using Multiple Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The air quality in China has experienced dramatic changes during the last few decades. To improve understanding of distribution, variations, and main influence factors of air pollution in central China, long-term multiple satellite observations from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) are used to characterize particle pollution and their primary gaseous precursors, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Hubei province during 2005-2017. Unlike other regions in eastern China, particle and gaseous pollutants exhibit distinct spatial and temporal patterns in central China due to differences in emission sources and control measures. OMI SO2 of the whole Hubei region reached the highest value of 0.2 Dobson unit (DU) in 2007 and then declined by more than 90% to near background levels. By contrast, OMI NO2 grew from 3.2 to 5.9 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) during 2005-2011 and deceased to 3.9 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) in 2017. Unlike the steadily declining SO2, variations of OMI NO2 flattened out in 2016 and increased 0.5 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) during 2017. As result, MODIS AOD at 550 nm increased from 0.55 to the peak value of 0.7 during 2005-2011 and then decreased continuously to 0.38 by 2017. MODIS AOD and OMI SO2 has a high correlation (R > 0.8), indicating that annual variations of SO2 can explain most changes of AOD. The air pollution in central China has notable seasonal variations, which is heaviest in winter and light in summer. While air quality in eastern Hubei is dominated by gaseous pollution such as O-3 and NOx, particle pollutants are mainly concentrated in central Hubei. The high consistency with ground measurements demonstrates that satellite observation can well capture variations of air pollution in regional scales. The increasing ozone (O-3) and NO2 since 2016 suggests that more control measures should be made to reduce O-3-related emissions. To improve the air quality in regional scale, it is necessary to monitor the dynamic emission sources with satellite observations at a finer resolution.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation in AOD and Correlation Analysis with PAR and NPP in China from 2001 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols can elicit variations in how much solar radiation reaches the ground surface due to scattering and absorption, which may affect plant photosynthesis and carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the spatio-temporal variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) are compared with that in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net primary productivity (NPP) during 2001-2017 in China using multiple remote sensing data. The correlations between them are analyzed at different scales. Overall, the AOD exhibited a northeast-to-southwest decreasing pattern in space. A national increasing trend of 0.004 year(-1) and a declining trend of -0.007 year(-1) of AOD are observed during 2001-2008 and 2009-2017. The direct PAR (PAR(dir)) and diffuse PAR (PAR(dif)) present consistent and opposite tendency with AOD during two periods, respectively. The total PAR (PAR(total)) shows a similar variation pattern with PAR(dir). In terms of annual variation, the peaks of AOD coincide with the peaks of PAR(dif) and the troughs of PAR(dir), indicating that aerosols have a significant positive impact on PAR(dir) and a negative impact on PAR(dif). Furthermore, the PAR(dir) has a stronger negative association with AOD than the positive correlation between PAR(dif) and AOD at national and regional scales, indicating that PAR(dir) is more sensitive to aerosol changes. The NPP has higher values in the east than in the west and exhibits a significant increasing trend of 0.035 gCm(-2)day(-1) after 2008. The NPP has a negative correlation (-0.4-0) with AOD and PAR(dif) and a positive correlation (0-0.4) with PAR(dir) in most areas of China. The area covered by forests has the highest NPP-PAR correlation, indicating that NPP in forests is more sensitive to the PAR than is the NPP in grasslands and croplands. This study is beneficial for interpreting the aerosol-induced PAR impact on plant growth and for predicting plant production on haze days.

TI  - Rapid Loss of Tidal Flats in the Yangtze River Delta since 1974
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the home to national nature reserves and a Ramsar wetland, the tidal flats of the Yangtze River Delta are of great significance for ecological security, at both the local and global scales. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal conditions of the tidal flats in the Yangtze River Delta remains lacking. Here, we propose using remote sensing to obtain a detailed spatiotemporal profile of the tidal flats, using all available Landsat images from 1974 to 2018 with the help of the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. In addition, reclamation data were manually extracted from time series Landsat images for the same period. We found that approximately 40.0% (34.9-43.1%) of the tidal flats in the study area have been lost since 1980, the year in which the tidal flat area was maximal. The change in the tidal flat areas was consistent with the change in the riverine sediment supply. We also found that the cumulative reclamation areas totaled 816.6 km(2) and 431.9 km(2) in the Yangtze estuary zone and along the Jiangsu coast, respectively, between 1974 and 2018. Because of reclamation, some areas (e.g., the Hengsha eastern shoal and Pudong bank), which used to be quite rich, have lost most of their tidal flats. Currently, almost 70% of the remaining tidal flats are located in the shrinking branch (North Branch) and the two National Nature Reserves (Chongming Dongtan and Jiuduansha) in the Yangtze estuary zone. Consequently, the large-scale loss of tidal flats observed was primarily associated with reduced sediment supply and land reclamation at the time scale of the study. Because increasing demand for land and rising sea levels are expected in the future, immediate steps should be taken to prevent the further deterioration of this valuable ecosystem.

TI  - Estimating the Growing Stem Volume of Chinese Pine and Larch Plantations based on Fused Optical Data Using an Improved Variable Screening Method and Stacking Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating growing stem volume (GSV) is very important for forest resource management. The GSV estimation is affected by remote sensing images, variable selection methods, and estimation algorithms. Optical images have been widely used for modeling key attributes of forest stands, including GSV and aboveground biomass (AGB), because of their easy availability, large coverage and related mature data processing and analysis technologies. However, the low data saturation level and the difficulty of selecting feature variables from optical images often impede the improvement of estimation accuracy. In this research, two GaoFen-2 (GF-2) images, a Landsat 8 image, and fused images created by integrating GF-2 bands with the Landsat multispectral image using the Gram-Schmidt method were first used to derive various feature variables and obtain various datasets or data scenarios. A DC-FSCK approach that integrates feature variable screening and a combination optimization procedure based on the distance correlation coefficient and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm was proposed and compared with the stepwise regression analysis (SRA) and random forest (RF) for feature variable selection. The DC-FSCK considers the self-correlation and combination effect among feature variables so that the selected variables can improve the accuracy and saturation level of GSV estimation. To validate the proposed approach, six estimation algorithms were examined and compared, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), kNN, Support Vector Regression (SVR), RF, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Stacking. The results showed that compared with GF-2 and Landsat 8 images, overall, the fused image (Red_Landsat) of GF-2 red band with Landsat 8 multispectral image improved the GSV estimation accuracy of Chinese pine and larch plantations. The Red_Landsat image also performed better than other fused images (Pan_Landsat, Blue_Landsat, Green_Landsat and Nir_Landsat). For most of the combinations of the datasets and estimation models, the proposed variable selection method DC-FSCK led to more accurate GSV estimates compared with SRA and RF. In addition, in most of the combinations obtained by the datasets and variable selection methods, the Stacking algorithm performed better than other estimation models. More importantly, the combination of the fused image Red_Landsat with the DC-FSCK and Stacking algorithm led to the best performance of GSV estimation with the greatest adjusted coefficients of determination, 0.8127 and 0.6047, and the smallest relative root mean square errors of 17.1% and 20.7% for Chinese pine and larch, respectively. This study provided new insights on how to choose suitable optical images, variable selection methods and optimal modeling algorithms for the GSV estimation of Chinese pine and larch plantations.

TI  - Changes of productivity with stand development in broadleaf-Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Stand age is a key factor affecting carbon stocks and fluxes of forest ecosystem. Quantification of the changes in forest productivity with stand development is critically important for optimizing forest age structure, facilitating maximum utilization of resources, and better realizing the role of forests in regulating the uptake, storage, and emission of CO2. In this study, using space for time substitution approach, we established 12 chronosequence plots in the broadleaf-Korean pine forests of Lushuihe. Using a locally parameterized Biome-BGC model, we simulated the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) with stand development and examined the changes with stand development in NPP of broadleaf-Korean pine forests under four developmental scenarios. Results showed that the biomass in broadleaf-Korean pine forests of different age-classes ranked in the order of young stand < mid-age stand < mature stand < over-mature stand, with the average value of (224.35 +/- 20.68), (237.23 +/- 39.96), (259.16 +/- 19.51), and (357.57 +/- 84.74) t.hm(-2), respectively. Modelled NPP in broadleaf-Korean pine forests of different developmental stages varied in the range of 489.8-588 g C.m(-2).a(-1), which were consistent with the observed data of MODIS NPP, highlighting the adequacy and accuracy of Biome-BGC model in simulating the carbon flux of broad-leaf-Korean pine forests. Simulated NPP displayed a pattern of initial increase and later decrease with stand development, reaching peak in the mid-age stand and being smallest in the over-mature stand. Simulations of NPP in broadleaf-Korean pine forest under four developmental scenarios showed that, for the two scenarios with planted Korean pine forests experiencing either natural development or controlled cutting, NPP was highest in the mature stage; whereas for the two scenarios with initial natural secondary birch forests experiencing either natural development or controlled cutting, NPP was highest in the young stage.

TI  - Laboratory Study on the Gastroenteritis Outbreak Caused by a Multidrug-Resistant <i>Campylobacter coli</i> in China
T2  - FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Three severe acute gastroenteritis patients were identified within a 5-h period in a sentinel hospital enrolled in the foodborne pathogen surveillance project in Beijing. All patients had high fever (over 38.5 degrees C), diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache. Ten grams of fresh patient stool sample and 25 g of six suspected foods were collected for real-time PCR screening for 10 major pathogens. Bacterial isolation was performed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and antibiotic susceptibility tests were conducted for all the isolates. Whole-genome sequences of the three Campylobacter coli isolates were compared using whole-genome MLST. All stool samples were positive for C. coli, as revealed by PCR. Eleven of the C. coli isolates had the same PFGE and ST type. All isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, consistent with the findings of the in silico antibiotic resistance gene profiling. Most coding sequences (99%, 1736/1739) were identical among the three sequenced isolates, except for three frameshift-mutated genes caused by the simple sequence repeats (poly-Gs). This was likely a single-source outbreak caused by a group of highly clonal C. coli. This was the first outbreak of severe gastroenteritis caused by C. coli in China.

TI  - Discriminating treed and non-treed wetlands in boreal ecosystems using time series Sentinel-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are recognized for their importance to a range of ecosystem goods and services; however, detailed information on wetland presence, type, extent, and persistence is challenging to attain over large areas and/or long time periods due to the spatial complexity and temporal dynamism of wetlands. In this study we explored the potential for within-year time series of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the free and open Sentinel-1 data archive to improve discrimination of treed and non-treed wetlands and non-wetlands in a boreal forest environment. Through a set of 3843 classification experiments for the year 2017, we tested the influence of three factors on classification accuracy: (i) input features (two backscatter coefficients in VV and VH polarization (sigma(VV) and sigma(VH)) and four quantitative measures derived from the Stokes vector); (ii) the temporal form of features (i.e. using all within-year observations versus generalized measures such as monthly/seasonal means or annualized statistics); and (iii) missing observations in Sentinel-1 time series due to varying observation availability across space. Among the tested features, we found the greatest utility in sigma(VV) and sigma(VH). Directly using all within-year observations yielded higher accuracy than using generalized temporal forms. Moreover, the temporal form of the features had a greater impact on classification accuracy than the features themselves. The highest overall accuracy (0.860 +/- 0.002) was achieved using sigma(VV) and sigma(VH) from all within-year observations. The majority of class confusion occurred between treed wetlands and non-wetlands. We found no significant reduction in the overall accuracy by simulated missing observations in time series when using all within-year observations. With the increasing availability of free and open data from the Sentinel-1 archive, new opportunities are emerging to readily integrate within-year time series into large-area land cover mapping, particularly if analysis-ready SAR data products further reduce preprocessing requirements for end users.

TI  - A temporal group attention approach for multitemporal multisensor crop classification
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal observation capability is of great significance in crop classification. Benefiting from time-intensive multitemporal multisensor RS data, we can obtain the fine temporal profiles of crops, and how to dig out the subtle differences of phenological profiles between crops is of great significance. In this paper, we propose a Temporal-Group-Attention classifier to distinguish subtle differences of crops phenology, and the TGA(Temporal-Group-Attention) modules imitate the information selection mechanism of cognitive neuroscience to highlight differences between categories and ignore their similarities. After first obtaining the group sequence features of multitemporal RS images, then we use TGA modules to select time periods with large differences in phenology. And the TGA mechanism utilizes a "feature recalibration" strategy to highlight phenological differences, which firstly performs "group squeeze", then "group excitation", and finally performs "group reweighting". In experiments, the proposed network is illustrated on a multitemporal dataset with sequence length of 65, in which the samples from Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8 are acquired over Central Valley of California throughout 2018. Then, we perform multiresolution fusion for the sensors with different spatial resolutions. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve better classification accuracies over the categories with similar phenological profiles, compared with traditional methods and regular group convolution network without attention mechanism.

TI  - A hierarchical interannual wheat yield and grain protein prediction model using spectral vegetative indices and meteorological data
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing data for predicting wheat yield and quality is becoming a more feasible alternative to destructive and post-harvest laboratory-based test methods. However, most prediction models which make use of remote sensing data are statistical rather than mechanistic, therefore difficult to extend at interannual and regional scales. In this work, an interannual expandable wheat yield and quality predicting model using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was developed, integrating hyperspectral and meteorological data. The results showed that the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for predicting wheat yield and grain protein content (GPC), one key indicator of grain quality, had low stability at the interannual extension. The predictive power for yield by HLM method was higher than OLS, with R-2, RMSEv and nRMSE values of 0.75, 1.10 t/ha, and 20.70 %, respectively. GPC prediction by the HLM method was enhanced when the gluten type was considered, with R-2, RMSEv and nRMSE values of 0.85, 1.02 %, and 6.87 %, respectively. The results of this study confirmed that HLM can be a robust method for improving yield and GPC predicting stability under various growing seasons in winter wheat.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Multi-Temporal RADARSAT-2 and VENμS Data for Crop Classification Based on 1D Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual crop inventory information is important for many agriculture applications and government statistics. The synergistic use of multi-temporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and available multispectral remote sensing data can reduce the temporal gaps and provide the spectral and polarimetric information of the crops, which is effective for crop classification in areas with frequent cloud interference. The main objectives of this study are to develop a deep learning model to map agricultural areas using multi-temporal full polarimetric SAR and multi-spectral remote sensing data, and to evaluate the influence of different input features on the performance of deep learning methods in crop classification. In this study, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) was proposed and tested on multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 and VEN mu S data for crop classification. Compared with the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and non-deep learning methods including XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machina (SVM), the Conv1D performed the best when the multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data (Pauli decomposition or coherency matrix) and VEN mu S multispectral data were fused by the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation. The Pauli decomposition and coherency matrix gave similar overall accuracy (OA) for Conv1D when fused with the VEN mu S data by the MNF transformation (OA = 96.65 +/- 1.03% and 96.72 +/- 0.77%). The MNF transformation improved the OA and F-score for most classes when Conv1D was used. The results reveal that the coherency matrix has a great potential in crop classification and the MNF transformation of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 and VEN mu S data can enhance the performance of Conv1D.

TI  - Extracting urban water bodies from high-resolution radar images: Measuring the urban surface morphology to control for radar's double-bounce effect
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is an effective method for extracting water bodies on a large scale. Radar imagery, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, can penetrate clouds and provide opportunities for water body identification when in situ observations are difficult to obtain because of severe weather conditions. However, when using SAR images in urban areas to extract water bodies, the radar's double-bounce effect results in complicated backscatter patterns of water near urban features such as buildings due to the side-looking properties of SAR sensors and the vertical urban structures. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a reliable urban water extraction framework for SAR images that integrates urban surface morphological features for controlling radar's multiple bounces. Statistical (logistic regression) and machine-learning (random forest) models were used to explore how radar's double-bounce effect influences the prediction performance of urban water extraction. Our findings indicate that when extracting urban water bodies, urban water's backscatter values could be significantly interfered by the neighboring building density above a threshold height that contributes to radar's multiple bounces. Without model calibration, our framework incorporating urban surface morphology demonstrates high prediction ability with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.914 and with 97.0% of urban water cells correctly identified by testing in another city sharing similar urban forms. In summary, our study provides a better understanding of the role of the urban surface morphology in the double-bounce effect in SAR images, specifically for differentiating urban water and land, thereby improving the accuracy of urban water extraction and enhancing the feasibility of further applications of SAR imagery under complex urban landscapes.

TI  - Sentinel-1 interferometry with ionospheric correction from global and local TEC maps for land displacement detection in Taiwan
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 satellite launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) offers an opportunity to apply the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) in 12-day revisit, a potential solution to effectively measure surface deformation. However, for areas affected by the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) in a global ionosphere pattern, the total electron content (TEC) irregularity between snapshots may induce extra fringes and further mislead the unwrapping and displacement results. To test the necessity of ionospheric correction, we utilize global and regional ionospheric vertical TEC maps, namely the Global Ionosphere Map (GIM) released by the International GNSS Service and the Taiwan Regional Ionospheric Map (TRIM) provided by a local GNSS network, to compensate ionospheric phases in the interferograms.Our experiments investigate 47 ascending image pairs in 2016 and 2017. Among them, two pairs of images whose differenced TEC (Delta TEC) stronger than 16.73 TEC unit in azimuthal gradient contain the clearest extra fringes. The results show that TRIM outperforms in reducing extra fringes caused by the ionospheric effect, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimated satellite line-of-sight displacement reduced from 105.03 mm to 9.94 mm as compared against ground truth data. We conclude that TRIM TEC map is able to remove long-wavelength background of ionosphere-induced displacement when a differenced TEC gradient larger than an empirical threshold of 15 TECU.

TI  - Regional Recurrence Rates With or Without Complete Axillary Dissection for Breast Cancer Patients with Node-Positive Disease on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Current standard of care for patients with breast cancer with a positive node on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is axillary dissection with irradiation of the regional nodes, but it is unknown whether axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be safely omitted if complete axillary radiation is delivered instead.Methods and Materials: We identified 161 patients found to have a positive sentinel lymph node on SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer between December 2006 and October 2017, who were treated with or without completion ALND. Local, regional, and distant recurrence and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patient, disease, and treatment factors potentially predictive of each outcome were entered into Cox regression analysis.Results: Median follow-up was 28.8 months (range, 2.5-137.0). The 3-year regional control rate did not differ according to extent of axillary surgery (92.6% for SLNB alone vs 96.4% for SLNB with ALND, P = .616). Regional recurrence occurred as part of first recurrence in 9 patients (5.6%). Five patients failed in axillary levels 1 or 2, 6 failed in axillary level 3 or supraclavicular nodes, and 2 failed in internal mammary nodes, with some patients failing in multiple regional nodal areas. Extent of axillary dissection (SLNB only vs SLNB plus ALND) did not predict for disease control or survival. Patients who underwent ALND were significantly more likely to have lymphedema (25.0% vs 9.4%, P = .021).Conclusions: Careful selection of patients with a positive sentinel node on SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for omission of completion ALND in favor of irradiation of the undissected axilla does not compromise local, regional, or distant control or overall survival and results in lower rates of lymphedema.

TI  - MODIS Fractional Snow Cover Mapping Using Machine Learning Technology in a Mountainous Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the poor accuracy of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) daily fractional snow cover product over the complex terrain of the Tibetan Plateau (RMSE = 0.30), unmanned aerial vehicle and machine learning technologies are employed to map the fractional snow cover based on MODIS over this terrain. Three machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machine, and back-propagation artificial neural network models, are trained and compared in this study. The results indicate that compared with the MODIS daily fractional snow cover product, the introduction of a highly accurate snow map acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles as a reference into machine learning models can significantly improve the MODIS fractional snow cover mapping accuracy. The random forest model shows the best accuracy among the three machine learning models, with an RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 0.23, especially over forestland and shrubland, with RMSEs of 0.13 and 0.18, respectively. Although the accuracy of the support vector machine and back-propagation artificial neural network models are worse over forestland and shrubland, their average errors are still better than that of MOD10A1. Different fractional snow cover gradients also affect the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, the random forest model remains stable in different fractional snow cover gradients and is, therefore, the best machine learning algorithm for MODIS fractional snow cover mapping in Tibetan Plateau areas with complex terrain and severely fragmented snow cover.

TI  - Analysis of Total Columns of Greenhouse Gas Based on Direct Observation and Comparison with Satellite Data in Hefei
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Observation of the total columns of H2O, CO2, CH4, and CO in Hefei is presented based on ground-based Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (EM27/SUN). The results show that, the XH2O and XCO2 vary greatly during the measurement period while the XCH4 and XCO vary slightly. The range of H2O and CO2 are 1 353.17 similar to 5 289.43 ppm and 409.22 similar to 415.05 ppm, at the same time, the standard deviation of XCH4 and XCO are in the order of 10(-2). The average values of XH2O, XCO2, XCH4 and XCO are 2 109.10 ppm, 411.59 ppm, 1.87 ppm and 0.13 ppm respectively. The measured XCO2 and XCH4 are compared with the WACCM model and GOSAT satellite data, respectively. The comparison results show that the XCO2 and XCH4 calculated by WACCM model are relatively stable, with only slight changes near the average value. The GOSAT observations are slightly lower than those of EM27/SUN observations, with the relative deviations of XCO2 and XCH4 are 0.45% and 0.34%, respectively. The time series of the total column of XCO2 and XCH4 from 2010 to 2018 are analyzed by the GOSAT satellite data. It is found that the value of XCO2 increases from 390.83 ppm to 410.30 ppm, with a relative growth rate of 4.9%; the value of XCH4 increases from 1.802 ppm to 1.869 ppm, with a relative growth rate of 3.7%. The results may provide the theoretical basis for tracking the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in Hefei and its surrounding areas.

TI  - An Empirical Model to Estimate Abundance of Nanophase Metallic Iron (npFe<SUP>0</SUP>) in Lunar Soils
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar soils gradually become mature when they are exposed to a space environment, and nanophase metallic iron (npFe(0)) generates within them. npFe(0) significantly changes the optical properties of lunar soils and affects the interpretation of the remotely sensed data of the lunar surface. In this study, a correlation analysis was conducted between npFe(0) abundance and reflectance spectra at short wavelengths for lunar soil samples in four size groups based on their spectral and compositional data, collected by the Lunar Soil Characterization Consortium (LSCC). Results show that 540 nm single scattering albedo (SSA) of lunar soils correlates well with their corresponding npFe(0) abundance for each size group of lunar soil samples. However, it is poorly correlated with npFe(0) abundance when all size groups were considered because of the strong interference from grain size variation of lunar soils. To minimize the effect of grain size, the correlation of npFe(0) abundance with the spectral ratio of 540 nm/810 nm SSA of all size groups for LSCC samples was calculated and results show that a higher correlation existed between them (R-2 = 0.91). This ratio can serve as a simple empirical model for estimating npFe(0) abundance in lunar soils. However, bias could be introduced to the estimation result when lunar soils possess a high content of agglutinitic glass and ilmenite. Our future work will focus on improving the model's performance for these lunar soils.

TI  - Event alert and detection in smart cities using anomaly information from remote sensing earthquake data
T2  - COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The weak seismic thermal infrared (TIR) anomaly information in offshore earthquake is one of the important contents of earthquake monitoring and event alert and detection of smart cities in coastal areas. To tackle the characteristics of offshore seismic TIR anomaly in the adjacent sea of mainland, this paper proposed a detailed event alert and detection method of offshore earthquake's weak TIR anomaly information in smart cities from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In this method, the monthly and quarterly brightness temperature background field was first established, and then the offshore seismic TIR anomaly were got by wavelet transform and relative power spectrum method from MODIS data. Finally, the current seismic TIR anomaly in the adjacent sea is analyzed and discussed in terms of space-time changes, sequential variation of power spectrum, relationship between anomaly area and earthquake magnitude, sensor performance and the assimilation of brightness temperature background field. Our experiments present that the distribution of weak seismic TIR anomaly information from remote sensing data is good agreement with the seismic activity fault belts. The results reveal that the weak seismic TIR anomaly information can potentially contribute the event alert and detection the offshore earthquake in the adjacent sea and monitoring earthquake.

TI  - A remote sensing and artificial neural network-based integrated agricultural drought index: Index development and applications
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable drought monitoring is critical for evaluating drought risk and reducing potential agricultural losses. However, many existing drought indices developed by a single indicator may not properly describe the complex features of agricultural drought. Here, we propose a new drought index-the integrated agricultural drought index (IDI), which describes the relationship between multiple variables and agricultural drought conditions. The derivation of IDI is based on the remote sensing data and the back-propagation (BP) neural network, capable of identifying the non-stationary relationship of drought conditions. Development of IDI involves the following meteo-hydrological variables: precipitation, land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil water capacity, and elevation. The lagging effect of NDVI with respect to precipitation and LST changes can also be captured by the proposed IDI. Our results indicate that the IDI based on a machine learning method can relax the assumption used in many existing indices that the input and output data are linearly correlated. Results also demonstrate that the IDI is close to SPI-3 and SPEI-3 in a case study of the North China Plain (NCP). Moreover, we found the drought condition in the NCP area is highly correlated with 10 cm depth soil moisture at 8 agrometeorological stations and the newly developed IDI can effectively monitor the drought in terms of onset, duration, extent, and intensity of a drought episode. Additionally, the IDI provides spatial information about root zone soil moisture that can facilitate agricultural drought monitoring. The proposed framework of IDI can also be applied in other regions of the world for agriculture management.

TI  - Remote sensing image fusion based on two-stream fusion network
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion (also known as pan-sharpening) aims at generating a high resolution multi-spectral (MS) image from inputs of a high spatial resolution single band panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution multi-spectral image. Inspired by the astounding achievements of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a variety of computer vision tasks, in this paper we propose a Two-stream Fusion Network (TFNet) to address the problem of pan-sharpening. Unlike many previous CNN based methods that consider pan-sharpening as a super-resolution problem and perform pan-sharpening through mapping the stacked PAN and MS to the target high resolution MS image, the proposed TFNet aims to fuse PAN and MS images in feature domain and reconstruct the pan-sharpened image from the fused features. The TFNet mainly consists of three parts. The first part is comprised of two networks extracting features from PAN and MS images, respectively. The subsequent network fuses them together to form compact features that represent both spatial and spectral information of PAN and MS images, simultaneously. Finally, the desired high spatial resolution MS image is recovered from the fused features through an image reconstruction network. Experiments on Quickbird and GaoFen-1 images demonstrate that the proposed TFNet can fuse PAN and MS images effectively, and produce pan-sharpened images competitive with even superior to state of the arts.

TI  - Prediction of Continuous Time Series Leaf Area Index Based on Long Short-Term Memory Network : a Case Study of Winter Wheat
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous time series of Leaf Area Index (LAI) can reflect the growth of winter wheat, and the prediction of future LAI is important for guiding agricultural production. The crop growth models, such as the World Food Studies (WO-FOST), can predict the future LAI by simulating the growth and development of winter wheat. But the simulation depends on numerous input parameters, such as future meteorological data, which is difficult to obtain. Due to the continuity and regularity of LAI variations of winter wheat, the future LAI can be predicted with historical LAI through deep learning methods. However, deep learning methods require a large number of samples with labels to build training dataset. The scarcity of training dataset limits the application of deep learning methods in practice. To solve the above problems, we used data assimilation framework to combine remote sensing data with WOFOST model and constructed 15-year time series dataset of winter wheat LAI in Hebei province. Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm was applied to minimize difference between corrected MODIS LAI and simulated LAI for optimizing initial parameters of WOFOST. Based on the dataset, multiple LAI prediction models with different input lengths of historical LAI were established by using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The abilities of different prediction models to delineate LAI variations of winter wheat were evaluated. Results showed that the LSTM-based models can predict the future LAI of winter wheat effectively. The prediction model with an input length of 20 days achieved the highest accuracy. and RMSE of the prediction model were 0. 986 5 and 0. 183 6 after winter wheat returned green. For different stages of winter wheat growth, the accuracy was higher before winter wheat bloomed and reduced slightly after winter wheat bloomed. Therefore, it could be concluded that the method of constructing training dataset proposed in this study could be a reference for the application of deep learning methods in similar problems. The prediction models built in this study also verified the effectiveness of the LSTM, which provided a helpful way for predicting the future LAI of crops.

TI  - Quantifying geographic accessibility to improve efficiency of entomological monitoring
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundVector-borne diseases are important causes of mortality and morbidity in humans and livestock, particularly for poorer communities and countries in the tropics. Large-scale programs against these diseases, for example malaria, dengue and African trypanosomiasis, include vector control, and assessing the impact of this intervention requires frequent and extensive monitoring of disease vector abundance. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases are low.Methodology/Principal findingsWe developed a system that allows the identification of monitoring sites where pre-intervention densities of vectors are predicted to be high, and travel cost to sites is low, highlighting the most efficient locations for longitudinal monitoring. Using remotely sensed imagery and an image classification algorithm, we mapped landscape resistance associated with on- and off-road travel for every gridded location (3m and 0.5m grid cells) within Koboko district, Uganda. We combine the accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine the most efficient locations for longitudinal data collection. Our modelled predictions were validated against empirical measurements of travel-time and existing maps of road networks. We applied this approach in northern Uganda where a large-scale vector control program is being implemented to control human African trypanosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by trypanosomes transmitted by tsetse flies. Our accessibility surfaces indicate a high performance when compared to empirical data, with remote sensing identifying a further similar to 70% of roads than existing networks.Conclusions/Significance By integrating such estimates with predictions of tsetse abundance, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal placement of sentinel monitoring sites for evaluating control programme efficacy, moving from a nuanced, ad-hoc approach incorporating intuition, knowledge of vector ecology and local knowledge of geographic accessibility, to a reproducible, quantifiable one.Author summaryAssessing the impact of vector control programmes requires longitudinal measurements of the abundance of insect vectors within intervention areas. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases of disease are low. Efficient monitoring involves a prior selection of monitoring sites that are easy to reach and produce rich information on vector abundance. Here, we used image classification and cost-distance algorithms to produce estimates of accessibility within Koboko district, Uganda, where vector control is contributing to the elimination of sleeping sickness, a neglected tropical disease (NTD). We combine an accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine locations which are associated with low cost (lowest travel time) and potential for longitudinal data collection (high pre-intervention abundance). Our method could be adapted for use in the planning and monitoring of tsetse- and other vector-control programmes. By providing methods to ensure that vector control programmes operate at maximum efficiency, we can ensure that the limited funding associated with some of these NTDs has the largest impact.

TI  - Identifying Spatially Correlated Patterns between Surface Water and Frost Risk Using EO Data and Geospatial Indices
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Frost is one the most significant hazards affecting various aspects of human lives including infrastructure, agriculture, economy and biodiversity. Water bodies are one of the key factors controlling temperature fluctuations and frost. This study introduces a contemporary method for identifying and spatially analyzing frost risk and also explores its spatial correlation with water bodies. The proposed technique is based on coupling freely distributed geospatial data with a time series of land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. A region located in NW Greece, which annually suffers from very low temperatures and frost conditions and hosts important infrastructure and other human activities, was selected as a case study. In total, 5944 images were processed covering a 14-year long period. A frost frequency map of the study area was compiled along with two geospatial indices associated to distance from rivers/lakes (Hydro Distance Index-HDI) and from the seashore (Sea Distance Index-SDI). Their combined statistical and spatial correlation analysis indicated a protective buffer zone from frost at distances up to 20 km from sea and up to 5 km from lakes and rivers respectively, suggesting that the protective buffer zone depends on the water volume. Statistically, frost frequency was found to be positively correlated with both SDI (rs = 0.527) and HDI (rs = 0.145). Also, the effect of topography was examined in our analysis. Results showed that altitude and slope were moderately correlated to frost frequency; yet, the significance of the correlation was reported to be lower to SDI. Furthermore, the spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed a correspondence in the clustering of frost frequency maps with the HDI and SDI. Our findings demonstrate that water bodies are a major controlling factor for frost occurrence, by lowering frost frequency in water surrounding areas. Furthermore, it highlights the promising potential of our proposed methodology in quantifying frost effects, which can form a potentially useful tool assisting effective planning of protection measures and frost hazard mitigation in general.

TI  - Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA in sentinel lymph nodes of patients with cervical cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (CC). In addition, the present study compared the positive rate of SLNs metastasis detected by routine pathological examination, and investigated the value of HPV-DNA in the detection of early CC lymph node micrometastasis. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used in order to evaluate the HPV DNA detection in all CC samples [International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA2-IIA2]. The consistency of HPV-DNA was compared between primary lesions and SLNs. The positive rates of HPV-DNA were compared with pathological diagnosis of SLN metastasis, and the association between the positive expression of HPV-DNA in SLNs and the clinical and pathological parameters of patients with cervical cancer were analyzed. A total of 345 sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 100 patients with IA2-IIA2 CC. The positive rates of RT-qPCR and conventional histopathological detection of SLNs metastasis were 31.6% (109/345) and 12.8% (44/345), respectively (P<0.001). The positive expression of HPV-DNA in SLNs was associated with the clinical stage and tumor diameter (P<0.05), but not with patients' age, depth of cervical invasion, histological grade, lymphatic and vascular space invasion (LVSI), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCAg) (P>0.05). The detection of HPV-DNA expression in pelvic lymph nodes of early CC may be used to improve the detection rate of micrometastasis, guide the postoperative adjuvant therapy more accurately and improve prognosis. Patients with positive HPV-DNA would require closer surveillance than those with negative HPV-DNA.

TI  - Variation of alpine lakes from 1986 to 2019 in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River, Tibetan Plateau using Google Earth Engine
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the variations in surface water associated with changes in air temperature, precipitation, and permafrost in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR), we studied the dynamics of alpine lakes larger than 0.01 km(2) during 1986-2019 using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The surface areas of water bodies in the HAYR were processed using mass remote sensing images consisting of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI, Sentinel-2A, and MODIS based on automatic extraction of water indices under GEE. Besides, the lake ice phenology of the Sister Lakes (the Gyaring Lake and the Ngoring Lake) was derived by threshold segmenting of water/ice area ratio. Results demonstrate that the change of surface areas experienced four stages: decreasing during 1986-2004, increasing during 2004-2012, decreasing again during 2012-2017, and increasing again during 2017-2019. Correspondingly, the number of small lakes decreased (-26.5 per year), increased (139.5 per year), again decreased (-109.0 per year), and again increased (433.0 per year). Eight lakes larger than 1 km(2 )disappeared in 2004 but restored afterward. The overall trends in the area of small lakes (0.01-1 km(2)), large lakes (>1 km(2)), and all lakes during 1986-2019 were 0.4, 3.1, and 3.4 km(2) per year, respectively. Although the onsets of freezing, freeze-up, breaking and the break-up of the Sister Lakes varied from year to year, there is no obvious trend regarding the lake ice phenology. Tendencies of lake variations in the HAYR are primarily related to the increased net precipitation and the declined aridity, followed by the construction of hydropower station around the outlet of the Ngoring Lake, as well as permafrost degradation.

TI  - Polarimetric Stationarity Omnibus Test (PSOT) for Selecting Persistent Scatterer Candidates with Quad-Polarimetric SAR Datasets
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the traditional single polarimetric persistent scatterers interferometric (PSI) technology, the amplitude dispersion index (ADI) is usually used to select persistent scatterer candidates (PSC). Obviously, based on single polarimetric information, it is difficult to use the statistical characteristics for comprehensively describing the temporal stability of scatterers, which leads to a decrease in persistent scatterer (PS) density. Considering that the temporal polarimetric stationarity of PS, the paper is based on complex Wishart distribution and proposes the polarimetric stationarity omnibus test (PSOT) for identifying PSC. The nonstationary pixels can be removed by the preset significance threshold, which reduces the subsequent processing error and the calculation cost. Then, the exhaustive search polarimetric optimization (ESPO) method is selected for improving the phase quality of PSCs while suppressing the sidelobe of the strong scatterer effectively. For validating the effectiveness of the proposed method, we select a time-series quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR-1 images in an urban area as experimental data and mainly perform five group experiments for detailed analysis, including the PSOT+ESPO, ADI+ESPO, ADI+HH, ADI+HV, and ADI+VV. The results show that the proposed PSOT+ESPO method has a better performance on both PSC selection and interferometric phase optimization aspects than that of other methods. Specifically, compared to the last four methods, both the PSCs and PSs identified by the proposed PSOT+ESPO are more concentrated in the high-coherence region. The PSs with the standard deviation (STD) less than 5mm in the PSOT+ESPO method account for 94% of all PSs, which is greater than that of the ADI+ESPO, ADI+HH, ADI+HV, and ADI+VV methods, respectively.

TI  - Retrieval and Validation of Water Turbidity at Metre-Scale Using Pleiades Satellite Data: A Case Study in the Gironde Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the use of frequent metre-scale resolution Pleiades satellite imagery to monitor water quality parameters in the highly turbid Gironde Estuary (GE, SW France). Pleiades satellite data were processed and analyzed in two representative test sites of the GE: 1) the maximum turbidity zone and 2) the mouth of the estuary. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) validate the Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction developed by Vanhellemont and Ruddick (2018) applied to Pleiades satellite data recorded over the GE; (ii) highlight the benefits of frequent metre-scale Pleiades observations in highly turbid estuaries by comparing them to previously validated satellite observations made at medium (250/300 m for MODIS, MERIS, OLCI data) and high (20/30 m for SPOT, OLI and MSI data) spatial resolutions. The results show that the DSF allows for an accurate retrieval of water turbidity by inversion of the water reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) and red wavebands. The difference between Pleiades-derived turbidity and field measurements was proven to be in the order of 10%. To evaluate the spatial variability of water turbidity at metre scale, Pleiades data at 2 m resolution were resampled to 20 m and 250 m to simulate typical coarser resolution sensors. On average, the derived spatial variability in the GE is lower than or equal to 10% and 26%, respectively, in 20-m and 250-m aggregated pixels. Pleiades products not only show, in great detail, the turbidity features in the estuary and river plume, they also allow to map the turbidity inside ports and capture the complex spatial variations of turbidity along the shores of the estuary. Furthermore, the daily acquisition capabilities may provide additional advantages over other satellite constellations when monitoring highly dynamic estuarine systems.

TI  - Mapping the multi-decadal mangrove dynamics of the Australian coastline
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves globally provide a diverse array of ecosystem services but these are impacted upon by both natural and anthropogenic drivers of change. In Australia, mangroves are protected by law and hence the natural drivers predominate. To determine annual national level changes in mangroves between 1987 and 2016, their extent (by canopy cover type) and dynamics were quantified using dense time-series (nominally every 16 days cloud permitting) of 25 m spatial resolution Landsat sensor data available within Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The potential area that mangroves occupied over this period was established as the union of mangrove maps generated for 1996, 2007-2010 and 2015/16 through the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW). Within this area, the green vegetation fractional cover (GVpc) was retrieved from each available cloud-masked Landsat scene through linear spectral unmixing. The 10th percentile (GVpc10) was then determined for each calendar year by comparing these data in a time-series. The percentage Planimetric Canopy Cover (PCC%) for each Landsat pixel was then estimated using a relationship between GVpc10 and LiDAR-derived PCC% (<1 m resolution and based on acquisitions from all states supporting mangroves, excluding Victoria). The resulting annual maps of mangrove extent and cover for Australia are the first to be generated at a continental scale and on an annual basis. These indicated that the total area of mangrove forest (canopy cover >20%; resolvable at the Landsat resolution) varied from a minima of 10,715 +/- 36 km(2) (95% confidence interval) in 1992 to a maxima of 11,388 km(2) +/- 38 km(2) (95% CI) in 2010, declining to 11,142 +/- 57 km(2) (95% CI) in 2017. In 2010 (maximum extent), the forests were classified as closed canopy (38.8%), open canopy (49.0%) and woodland mangrove (12.2%). The majority of change occurred along the northern Australian coastline and was concentrated in the major gulfs and sounds. The 30 national maps of annual mangrove extent represent a reference dataset, which is publicly available through the Terrestrial Environment Research Network (TERN) landscapes portal. Future efforts are focusing on the routine production of annual mangrove maps beyond 2019 as part of Australia's efforts to monitor the coastal environment.

TI  - Alexander Solodovnikov's poetry: aesthetics and worldview
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with a phenomenon of religious poetry of Alexander Solodovnikov, who was a poet-prisoner of GULAG. The research problem is to define the esthetic principles of his poetry as well as to reveal how the Christian outlook manifests itself in art comprehension of the world and the man. The most important components of spiritual life of the Christian poet are chosen for the analysis: relation to suffering and death, tendency to humility and repentance, faith in Providence and praise to the Creator. Such external objects of his poetic reflection as the nature, time, history, the fate of Russia, Old Russian culture and scientific progress are also analyzed. A subject of consideration is also the bible context of his creativity, namely using of evangelic reminiscences as a semantic support of the poem and the development of an old psalm tradition. Observations over texts allow to conclude that the ethic and esthetic principles of Solodovnikov's poetry have the fundamental difference from modern secular culture. The center of his poetic system is not the subjective perception of the various phenomena and events but a religious image itself.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal data fusion for massive sea surface temperature data from MODIS and AMSR-E instruments
T2  - ENVIRONMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have been widely used to study various geophysical processes. With the advances in remote sensing technology, massive amount of remote sensing data are collected in space over time. Different satellite instruments typically have different footprints, measurement-error characteristics, and data coverages. To combine data sets from different satellite instruments, we propose a dynamic fused Gaussian process (DFGP) model that enables fast statistical inference such as filtering and smoothing for massive spatio-temporal data sets in a data-fusion context. Based upon a spatio-temporal-random-effect model, the DFGP methodology represents the underlying true process with two components: a linear combination of a small number of basis functions and random coefficients with a general covariance matrix, together with a linear combination of a large number of basis functions and Markov random coefficients. To model the underlying geophysical process at different spatial resolutions, we rely on the change-of-support property, which also allows efficient computations in the DFGP model. To estimate model parameters, we devise a computationally efficient stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm to ensure its scalability for massive data sets. The DFGP model is applied to a total of 3.7 million sea surface temperature data sets in the tropical Pacific Ocean for a one-week time period in 2010 from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instruments.

TI  - Contemporary forest carbon dynamics in the northern US associated with land cover changes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of the spatial-temporal distributions of forest carbon (C) stocks subject to land use and cover changes is critical to greenhouse gas (GHG) estimation and reporting. Based on national forest inventory (NFI) and Landsat time series data, we applied matrix models to estimate and map spatial-temporal distributions of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) C, standing dead C, downed dead C, litter C, and soil organic C from 1990 to 2018 attributed to land cover changes and harvests in the northern United States (US). From predicted pixel-level maps, we found that all five forest C pools of northeast states and northern tier of Great Lake states had higher C density than other regions in the study area. We estimated that forest-related land cover changes reduced the forest C sink by 0.15 ton C ha(-1) yr(-1) (with a range of 0.12 to 0.18 ton C ha(-1) yr(-1)) a accounting for 29% of forest C reductions over the study period. Forests remaining forests sequestered 2.38 Pg C (2.05 to 2.61 Pg C), hence the net forest sink of the northern US increased 1.73 Pg C (1.52 to 1.93 Pg C) during 1990-2018, which is an annual rate of 0.88 ton C ha(-1) yr(-1) (0.77 to 0.98 ton C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Moreover, forest C was captured in harvested wood products by 0.33 ton C ha(-1) yr(-1). An uncertainty analysis with fuzzy sets suggested that the absolute uncertainties of land cover change and harvest impacts on standing dead C, downed dead C, and litter C were lower than 4.50 ton ha(-1) during 1990-2018. In comparison, there were high uncertainties associated with estimates of soil organic C and AGB C densities at approximately 12-40 ton ha(-1) in northern Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Maine, New Hampshire, and New York. This study demonstrates methods for adhering to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change good practice guidelines for national GHG reporting and presents spatially explicit attribution of regional trends in C fluxes to particular activities and events. The resolved estimates from this analysis can be used to examine local and regional land use and cover change policies and practices in the context of C management in the northern US.

TI  - Efficacy of multi-season Sentinel-2 imagery for compositional vegetation classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation maps are essential tools for the conservation and management of landscapes as they contain essential information for informing conservation decisions. Traditionally, maps have been created using field-based approaches which, due to limitations in costs and time, restrict the size of the area for which they can be created and frequency at which they can be updated. With the increasing availability of satellite sensors providing multi-spectral imagery with high temporal frequency, new methods for efficient and accurate vegetation mapping have been developed. The objective of this study was to investigate to what extent multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery can assist in mapping complex compositional classifications at fine spatial scales. We deliberately chose a challenging case study, namely a visually and structurally homogenous scrub vegetation (known as kwongan) of Western Australia. The classification scheme consists of 24 target classes and a random 60/40 split was used for model building and validation. We compared several multi-temporal (seasonal) feature sets, consisting of numerous combinations of spectral bands, vegetation indices as well as principal component and tasselled cap transformations, as input to four machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines; SVM, Nearest Neighbour; NN, Random Forests; RF, and Classification Trees; CT) to separate target classes. The results show that a multi-temporal feature set combining autumn and spring images sufficiently captured the phenological differences between the classes and produced the best results, with SVM (74%) and NN (72%) classifiers returning statistically superior results compared to RF (65%) and CT (50%). The SWIR spectral bands captured during spring, the greenness indices captured during spring and the tasselled cap transformations derived from the autumn image emerged as most informative, which suggests that ecological factors (e.g. shared species, patch dynamics) occurring at a sub-pixel level likely had the biggest impact on class confusion. However, despite these challenges, the results are auspicious and suggest that seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery has the potential to predict compositional vegetation classes with high accuracy. Further work is needed to determine whether these results are replicable in other vegetation types and regions.

TI  - Ensemble averaging based assessment of spatiotemporal variations in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over Delhi, India, during 2010-2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated levels of ambient air pollution has been implicated as a major risk factor for morbidities and premature mortality in India, with particularly high concentrations of particulate matter in the Indo-Gangetic plain. High resolution spatiotemporal estimates of such exposures are critical to assess health effects at an individual level. This article retrospectively assesses daily average PM2.5 exposure at 1 km. 1 km grids in Delhi, India from 2010 to 2016, using multiple data sources and ensemble averaging approaches. We used a multi-stage modeling exercise involving satellite data, land use variables, reanalysis based meteorological variables and population density. A calibration regression was used to model PM2.5: PM10 to counter the sparsity of ground monitoring data. The relationship between PM2.5 and its spatiotemporal predictors was modeled using six learners; generalized additive models, elastic net, support vector regressions, random forests, neural networks and extreme gradient boosting. Subsequently, these predictions were combined under a generalized additive model framework using a tensor product based spatial smoothing. Overall cross-validated prediction accuracy of the model was 80% over the study period with high spatial model accuracy and predicted annual average concentrations ranging from 87 to 138 mu g/m(3). Annual average root mean squared errors for the ensemble averaged predictions were in the range 39.7-62.7 mu g/m(3) with prediction bias ranging between 4.6 and 11.2 mu g/m(3). In addition, tree based learners such as random forests and extreme gradient boosting outperformed other algorithms. Our findings indicate important seasonal and geographical differences in particulate matter concentrations within Delhi over a significant period of time, with meteorological and land use features that discriminate most and least polluted regions. This exposure assessment can be used to estimate dose response relationships more accurately over a wide range of particulate matter concentrations.

T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. An understanding of large herbivore habitat choices in heterogeneous African protected areas is important for the better management of these key ecosystems.Aims. To determine habitat use of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and plains zebra (Equus quagga) in a heterogeneous protected area.Methods. Zambezi National Park (ZNP), Zimbabwe, was divided into five vegetation types using an unsupervised classification on a Landsat satellite image that was classified into five land cover classes, using the K-means classification algorithm. African buffalo and plains zebra densities were then determined in each vegetation type using road transect surveys monthly between January 2013 and December 2015. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), grass biomass, grass height and grass quality (nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and acid detergent fibre content) were determined in each vegetation type during the wet (November to April) and dry (August to October) seasons to establish their quality as habitats for African buffalo and plains zebra.Key results. Both African buffalo and plains zebra mostly foraged in mixed and grassland areas, and avoided Zambezi teak vegetation type. Zambezi teak vegetation type had high NDVI due to the dense tree cover. Both African buffalo and plains zebra preferred vegetation types with intermediate grass biomass (approximately 300 g m(-2)) and grass height (approximately 16 cm). Grass nutritive value (in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and acid detergent fibre) declined from wet to dry season in all vegetation types.Conclusions. African buffalo and plains zebra in the ZNP confined their habitat use mostly to two vegetation types (mixed and grassland), which together covered 25% of the protected area.Implications. Teak (Baikiaea plurijuga) vegetation, which accounted for about 60% of the ZNP, was avoided by both African buffalo and plains zebra, suggesting that a significant part of the protected area was not used by the two herbivores.

M3  - Article
AB  - Nuclear power plants accidents should be seen as very complex issues, once they encompass environmental and social aspects that must be integrated to sustain appropriate management measures in a potential disaster event. Therefore, emergency plans require sounds spatial information knowledge and the interactions of their environments. The herein study aims to contribute to the emergency plans, especially to the possible evacuation routes identification for a Nuclear Power Plant located in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. The study was conducted within 120 km radius around the power plant. Results indicate that evacuation plans should be elaborated for the urban cores with low roads availability, or even for high population density areas, that in spite of being well served by alternative routes, exhibit increased road traffic and population flow. These results present important information to provide support to local emergency management actions and guidelines, playing a key role to assist on the evacuation planning.

TI  - Considerations for using distributed research networks to conduct aspects of randomized trials
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stakeholders in the clinical research enterprise are aligned around the need to make clinical research in general, and randomized controlled trials in particular, more meaningful and efficient. To that end, we have built distributed research networks (DRNs) for the Sentinel System, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Collaboratory, and the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). DRNs reuse electronic health record (EHR) and claims data for research. The design and use of health data DRNs is complicated by lack of uniformity in data collection, a fragmented healthcare system, and the imperative to protect research participants.We describe the key elements of successful DRNs, as well as methods, challenges, and solutions we have encountered in using DRNs to support different phases of randomized, multi-site, clinical research. This work supports "real-world" efforts to build a learning health system and will enable others to conduct randomized clinical trial research using a DRN.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: performance of hysteroscopic injection of tracers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo report on the performance of hysteroscopic injection of tracers (indocyanine green (ICG) and technetium-99m (Tc-99m)) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial cancer.MethodsSingle-center retrospective evaluation of consecutive patients who underwent SLN mapping following hysteroscopic peritumoral injection of tracer. Detection rate (overall/bilateral/aortic) diagnostic accuracy, and oncologic outcomes were evaluated.ResultsA total of 221 procedures met the inclusion criteria. Mean patient age was 60 (range 28-84) years and mean body mass index was 26.9 (range 15-47) kg/m(2) . In 164 cases (70.9%) mapping was performed laparoscopically. The overall detection rate of the technique was 94.1% (208/221 patients). Bilateral pelvic mapping was found in 62.5% of cases with at least one SLN detected and was more frequent using ICG than with Tc-99m (73.8% vs 53.3%; p<0.001). In 47.6% of cases SLNs mapped in both pelvic and aortic nodes, and in five cases (2.4%) only in the aortic area. In eight patients (3.8%) SLNs were found in aberrant (parametrial/presacral) areas. Mean number of detected SLNs was 3.7 (range 1-8). In 51.9% of cases at least one node other than SLNs was removed. Twenty-six patients (12.5%) had nodal involvement: 12 (46.2%) macrometastases, six (23.1%) micrometastases, and eight (30.7%) isolated tumor cells. In 12 cases (46.8%) the aortic area was involved. Overall, 6/221 (2.7%) patients had isolated para-aortic nodes. Three false-negative results were found, all in the Tc-99m group. All had isolated aortic metastases. Overall sensitivity was 88.5% (95% CI 71.7 to 100.0) and overall negative predictive value was 96.5% (95% CI 86.8 to 100.0). There were 10 (4.8%) recurrences: five abdominal/distant, four vaginal, and one nodal (in the aortic area following a unilateral mapping plus side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy). Most recurrences (9/10 cases) were patients in whom a completion lymphadenectomy was performed. No deaths were reported after a mean follow-up of 47.7 months.ConclusionsHysteroscopic injection of tracers for SLN mapping in endometrial cancer is as accurate as cervical injection with a higher detection rate in the aortic area. ICG improves the bilateral detection rate. Adding lymphadenectomy to SLN mapping does not reduce the risk of relapse.

TI  - The vocal repertoire of the Cactus Conure<i>Eupsittula cactorum</i>(Aves; Psittaciformes)
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Few species of Psittaciformes have the vocal repertoire used to facilitate complex social interactions described. The Cactus Conure (Eupsittula cactorum) is not an exception since it depends on acoustic communication for many aspects of its biology. Here, we describe the vocal repertoire ofE. cactorum. The research was undertaken between September 2015 and April 2016 at Quixada (Ceara state, Brazil), where the birds were recorded in the early mornings (05:00-09:00 h) and late afternoons (15:00-18:00 h). During the observations, we recorded the calls and described the behavioral responses to each of these calls. We found nine calls, namely sentinel, flight contact, food appeal, flight call, alarm, alarm II; juvenile alarm, agonistic, congregation. A multinomial regression shows that each of these components is structurally different, and displays enough call differentiation to guarantee efficient communication. The species is especially vocally active when the individuals are in large flocks, but the individuals are discreet and quiet when alone or in pairs. On these behavioral contexts, it was common to observe low-intensity signals, proper for close-range interactions. Overall,E. cactorumshows a complex repertoire, which is somewhat expected for social species.

AB  - R. Zvi Yehudah ha-Kohen Kook (RZiYah, 1891-1982), the head of the yeshivah at "Merkaz ha-Hay" in Jerusalem, was one of the most prominent religious Zionist leaders of the twentieth century. He was also the son of H. Abraham Isaac ha-Kohen Kook, a relationship that had a decisive impact on his thought and work throughout his life. The purpose of the present study is to shed light on RZiYah's attitude toward work. Did he see work as a basic human obligation spelled out by the physical need for survival? Did he associate an ideological value with work, as part of a worldview integrating religious values with extra-religious ones, similar to socialism? Or did he see work as a religious value, one that stemmed from his theology?

TI  - Volcanic Hot-Spot Detection Using SENTINEL-2: A Comparison with MODIS-MIROVA Thermal Data Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the satellite thermal remote sensing, the new generation of sensors with high-spatial resolution SWIR data open the door to an improved constraining of thermal phenomena related to volcanic processes, with strong implications for monitoring applications. In this paper, we describe a new hot-spot detection algorithm developed for SENTINEL-2/MSI data that combines spectral indices on the SWIR bands 8a-11-12 (with a 20-meter resolution) with a spatial and statistical analysis on clusters of alerted pixels. The algorithm is able to detect hot-spot-contaminated pixels (S2Pix) in a wide range of environments and for several types of volcanic activities, showing high accuracy performances of about 1% and 94% in averaged omission and commission rates, respectively, underlining a strong reliability on a global scale. The S2-derived thermal trends, retrieved at eight key-case volcanoes, are then compared with the Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP) derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and processed by the MIROVA (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity) system during an almost four-year-long period, January 2016 to October 2019. The presented data indicate an overall excellent correlation between the two thermal signals, enhancing the higher sensitivity of SENTINEL-2 to detect subtle, low-temperature thermal signals. Moreover, for each case we explore the specific relationship between S2Pix and VRP showing how different volcanic processes (i.e., lava flows, domes, lakes and open-vent activity) produce a distinct pattern in terms of size and intensity of the thermal anomaly. These promising results indicate how the algorithm here presented could be applicable for volcanic monitoring purposes and integrated into operational systems. Moreover, the combination of high-resolution (S2/MSI) and moderate-resolution (MODIS) thermal timeseries constitutes a breakthrough for future multi-sensor hot-spot detection systems, with increased monitoring capabilities that are useful for communities which interact with active volcanoes.

TI  - Determining subsurface oceanic changes in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean using Argo float data
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is one of the most prominent climate modes in the southern hemisphere. Although the influence of SAM on the surface ocean state has been revealed by remote-sensing data, its influence on the subsurface ocean state is not well-defined. Starting in the mid-2000s, the Argo-float network was extended into higher-latitude regions in front of the sea ice zone, in particular in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Integrated data, including several shipboard observations, enables us to investigate the relationship between interannual changes in the SAM and the surface-to-2000-m oceanic state. In this paper, we show that recent interannual changes in the wintertime subsurface oceanic state in the Indian sector are consistent with the fast response to the SAM proposed by previous model studies. In particular, the change in salinity is highly correlated with SAM variation, which has not been previously reported.

TI  - Daily MODIS Snow Cover Maps for the European Alps from 2002 onwards at 250 m Horizontal Resolution Along with a Nearly Cloud-Free Version
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Snow cover dynamics impact a whole range of systems in mountain regions, from society to economy to ecology; and they also affect downstream regions. Monitoring and analyzing snow cover dynamics has been facilitated with remote sensing products. Here, we present two high-resolution daily snow cover data sets for the entire European Alps covering the years 2002 to 2019, and with automatic updates. The first is based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and its implementation is specifically tailored to the complex terrain, exploiting the highest possible resolution available of 250 m. The second is a nearly cloud-free product derived from the first using temporal and spatial filters, which reduce average cloud cover from 41.9% to less than 0.1%. Validation has been performed using an extensive network of 312 ground stations, and for the cloud filtering also with cross-validation. Average overall accuracies were 93% for the initial and 91.5% for the cloud-filtered product using the ground stations; and 95.3% for the cross-validation of the cloud-filter. The data can be accessed online and via the R and python programming languages. Possible applications of the data include but are not limited to hydrology, cryosphere and climate.

TI  - Improving Hayabusa2 trajectory by combining LIDAR data and a shape model
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise information of spacecraft position with respect to target body is of importance in terms of scientific interpretation of remote sensing data. In case of Hayabusa2, a sample return mission from asteroid Ryugu, such information is also necessary for landing site selection activity. We propose a quick method to improve the spacecraft trajectory when laser altimeter range measurements and a shape model are provided together with crude initial trajectory, spacecraft attitude information, and asteroid spin information. We compared topographic features contained in the altimeter data with those expressed by the reference shape model, and estimated long-period trajectory correction so that discrepancy between the two topographic profiles was minimized. The improved spacecraft positions are consistent with those determined by image-based stereophotoclinometry method within a few tens of meters. With such improved trajectory, the altimeter ranges can be converted to Ryugu's topographic profiles that are appropriate for geophysical interpretation. We present a geophysical application that invokes possibility of impact-induced formation of the Ryugu's western bulge.

TI  - Sensitivity of Arctic Sea Ice Extent to Sea Ice Concentration Threshold Choice and Its Implication to Ice Coverage Decadal Trends and Statistical Projections
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice extent has been utilized to monitor sea ice changes since the late 1970s using remotely sensed sea ice data derived from passive microwave (PM) sensors. A 15% sea ice concentration threshold value has been used traditionally when computing sea ice extent (SIE), although other threshold values have been employed. Does the rapid depletion of Arctic sea ice potentially alter the basic characteristics of Arctic ice extent? In this paper, we explore whether and how the statistical characteristics of Arctic sea ice have changed during the satellite data record period of 1979-2017 and examine the sensitivity of sea ice extents and their decadal trends to sea ice concentration threshold values. Threshold choice can affect the timing of annual SIE minimums: a threshold choice as low as 30% can change the timing to August instead of September. Threshold choice impacts the value of annual SIE minimums: in particular, changing the threshold from 15% to 35% can change the annual SIE by more than 10% in magnitude. Monthly SIE data distributions are seasonally dependent. Although little impact was seen for threshold choice on data distributions during annual minimum times (August and September), there is a strong impact in May. Threshold choices were not found to impact the choice of optimal statistical models characterizing annual minimum SIE time series. However, the first ice-free Arctic summer year (FIASY) estimates are impacted; higher threshold values produce earlier FIASY estimates and, more notably, FIASY estimates amongst all considered models are more consistent. This analysis suggests that some of the threshold choice impacts to SIE trends may actually be the result of biased data due to surface melt. Given that the rapid Arctic sea ice depletion appears to have statistically changed SIE characteristics, particularly in the summer months, a more extensive investigation to verify surface melt impacts on this data set is warranted.

TI  - Independent Component Analysis and Parametric Approach for Source Separation in InSAR Time Series at Regional Scale: Application to the 2017-2018 Slow Slip Event in Guerrero (Mexico)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Separating different sources of signal in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) studies over large areas is challenging, especially between the long-wavelength changes of atmospheric conditions and tectonic deformations, both correlated to elevation. In this study, we focus on the 2017-2018 slow slip event (SSE) in the Guerrero state (Mexico) where (1) the permanent GPS network has a low spatial density (less than 30 stations in an area of 300 x 300 km) with uneven distribution; (2) the tropospheric phase delays can be as high as 20 cm of apparent ground displacements, with a complex temporal evolution; (3) the tested global weather models fail to correct interferograms with enough accuracy (with residual tropospheric signal higher than the tectonic signal); and (4) the surface displacement caused by the seismic cycle shows complex interactions between seismic sequences and aseismic events. To extract the SSE signal from Sentinel-1 InSAR time series, we test two different approaches. The first (parametric method) consists of a least squares linear inversion, imposing a functional form for each deformation or atmospheric component. The second uses independent component analysis of the InSAR time series. We obtain time series maps of surface displacements along the radar line of sight associated with the SSE and validate these results with a comparison to GPS. Combining those two approaches, we propose a method to separate atmospheric delays and tectonic deformation on time series data not corrected from atmospheric delays. From the extracted ground deformation maps, we propose a first-order slip inversion model at the subduction interface during this SSE.

TI  - Foucault on the Wards: Rediscovering Reflection as a Social Pediatrician in Training
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author states that as a second-year medical student with a liberal arts degree, it was often difficult for him to reconcile his former liberal arts education with the current demands of his training. Although the medical curriculum increasingly acknowledges the importance of a biopsychosocial model, the prioritization of knowledge remains the same: know your biological, pharmacological, and anatomical facts. However, the author's experience with a social pediatrics research summer studentship moved him beyond this basic sciences mindset and provided a practical framework for the application of his liberal arts training. The experience was twofold: he worked on a research project while simultaneously shadowing a pediatrician twice a week. His project applied a Foucauldian critical discourse analysis (CDA) to an archive of texts that sought to better characterize the term social pediatrics. The author concludes that the thought-changing reflection, mentorship, and concrete clinical experiences made possible by the summer studentship expanded his worldview.The author discusses the complementary relationship between CDA, clinical experience, and self-reflection in the developing clinician. The purpose of his essay is threefold. First, by drawing on concepts from Descartes' Meditations and Plato's allegory of the cave, he establishes educational continuity between his liberal arts and medical training. Second, using clinical examples, he explores the practicality of discourse analysis and how skills regarding empathy and bias awareness are transferrable to the wards. Last, he highlights the importance of cognitive dissonance and transformative learning in the maturing physician.

TI  - Work Incentives for "Welfare Mothers" in 1970s Ontario: Screening Out the Political
T2  - LABOUR-LE TRAVAIL
M3  - Article
AB  - THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES the politics surrounding the 1970s/early 1980s introduction of work-incentive measures for "welfare mothers" in Ontario. It uses governance and assemblage theory to analyze the substance and dynamics of the debates in this area as they involved state officials, social policy and social welfare advocates, and welfare mother activists. Using a wide array of archival documents and media accounts, the article uncovers the discursive and other kinds of practices that government officials used in seeking to contain the debate and foreclose more radical possibilities, as well as the role that progressive groups sometimes played in reinforcing official expertise. The article concludes that the work incentives for welfare mothers measures were not just benign policy but mechanisms that screened out the political and, ultimately, further disempowered and marginalized welfare mothers. Such programs operate to this day to reinforce a worldview that ignores structural oppression and inequality.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymphedema is a feared complication of cancer treatments that negatively affects survivors' quality of life. The true incidence of lymphedema is difficult to determine given its long latency period. As the number of survivors of cancer is increasing in the United States, lymphedema is poised to be a major health concern. The most noteworthy risk factor for lymphedema is comprehensive lymph node dissection. The last 2 decades have witnessed a dramatic shift in cancer treatment in an attempt to systematically de-escalate therapeutic interventions, specifically seeking to shift treatment away from routine lymph node dissection in favor of sentinel node biopsy or radiation strategies, thereby reducing the risk for lymphedema while maintaining survival outcomes. A growing body of robust evidence supports prospective screening and thereby a prospective surveillance model (PSM) for early diagnosis and intervention for the prevention and treatment of lymphedema. Finally, investigators are actively evaluating the effectiveness of contemporary surgical procedures in ameliorating the symptoms and disability of patients with lymphedema and reducing the risk of future episodes of cellulitis, with outcomes of surgery significantly better than with conservative therapy alone. In this article, we review the current data surrounding these initiatives.

TI  - An Effective Way to Map Land-Use Intensity with a High Spatial Resolution Based on Habitat Type and Environmental Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring agricultural land-use intensity (LUI) changes are essential for understanding their effects on biodiversity. Current land-use models provide a rather coarse spatial resolution, while in-situ measurements of LUI cover only a limited extent and are time-consuming and expensive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using habitat type, topo-climatic, economic output, and remote-sensing data to map LUI at a high spatial resolution. To accomplish this, we first rated the habitat types across the agricultural landscape in terms of the amount and frequency of fertiliser input, pesticide input, ploughing, grazing, mowing, harvesting, and biomass output. We consolidated these ratings into one LUI index per habitat type that we then related to topo-climatic, economic output, and remote-sensing predictors. The results showed that the LUI index was strongly related to plant indicator values for mowing tolerance and soil nutrient content and to aerial nitrogen deposition, and thus, is an adequate index. Topo-climatic, and, to a smaller extent, economic output and remote-sensing predictors, proved suitable for mapping LUI. Large- to medium-scale patterns are explained by topo-climatic predictors, while economic output predictors explain medium-scale patterns and remote-sensing predictors explain local-scale patterns. With the fine-scale LUI map produced from this study, it is now possible to estimate within unvarying land-use classes, the effect on agrobiodiversity of an increase in LUI on fertile and accessible lands and of a decrease of LUI by the abandonment of marginal agricultural lands, and thus, provide a valuable base for understanding the effects of LUI on biodiversity. Due to the worldwide availability of remote-sensing and climate data, our methodology can be easily applied to other countries where habitat-type data are available. Given their low explanatory power, economic output variables may be omitted if not available.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining operations across the world often lead to contamination of land, water resources, ecosystems and in some cases, entire communities. Results of recent health and ground sampling studies revealed extensive lead contamination within the populace and around the City of Cerro de Pasco, Peru. Tailings excavated from a large open pit zinc mine in the center of the city have been aggregated in four large stockpiles within close proximity to neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals. Visual comparison of ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) imagery from 2001 and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2018 suggests a size increase in one tailing stockpile in particular near the neighborhood of Paragsha. Due to ongoing mining efforts, the hypothesis motivating the work presented here is that Pb-bearing minerals would be detectable through multispectral analysis, an increase in Pb mineral percent abundance would be observed and tailing stockpile volume would be detectable between 2001 and 2016. This hypothesis is tested using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE), and Jeffries-Matusita distance calculation on ASTER (2001) and Sentinel-2 (2018) VNIR and SWIR bands. Volume and area estimate of tailing stockpiles were calculated using a photogrammetrically derived point cloud. SAM detected the presence of five Pb-bearing minerals around Cerro de Pasco and Paragsha. The results of the temporal SAM analysis displayed an increase of approximately 17% of Pb-bearing minerals around the greater Cerro de Pasco city area and approximately 11% for the neighborhood of Paragsha. Jeffries-Matusita distance results suggest clear correlation between contamination sources and affected locations. Total tailing stockpile volume was measured to be approximately 200,300,000 m(3). Volume for Pile 4 was estimated to have increased by approximately 46,000,000 m(3) between 2001 and 2018. These presented results will hopefully inspire and guide future remote sensing campaigns, perhaps involving a UAV or aircraft-based hyperspectral instrument. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating Land and Sea Surface Temperature From Cross-Calibrated Chinese Gaofen-5 Thermal Infrared Data Using Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Joint Polar Satellite System enterprise algorithm and the quadratic split-window (SW) algorithm were adapted to high spatial resolution thermal infrared (TIR) data of Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF5) to estimate the land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST), respectively. Lacking official calibration coefficients, GF5 TIR data were cross-calibrated by the well-characterized Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. The coefficients of two SW algorithms were obtained by linear regression from the simulated data set generated via comprehensive radiative transfer modeling. The performance of the two algorithms was first evaluated by independent simulation data and then cross-validated by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST/SST, VIIRS LST/SST, and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) SST products. The preliminary results show good agreement between estimated GF5 LSTs/SSTs and referenced LST/SST products, with an average bias (root mean square error) of -0.26 (1.74), -2.48 (3.49), 0.18 (2.43), and -1.47 K (2.86 K) for VLSTO, VNP21, MYD11, and MYD21 LST products, -0.79 (1.55), -0.28(1.58), and -1.71 (2.21) K for VIIRS, MODIS, and AHI SST products. This is the first time that both LST and SST are retrieved from the real GF5 data. This letter provides a practical method to estimate LST and SST from Chinese Gaofen-5.

TI  - Harmonization of Space-Borne Infra-Red Sensors Measuring Sea Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is observed by a constellation of sensors, and SST retrievals are commonly combined into gridded SST analyses and climate data records (CDRs). Differential biases between SSTs from different sensors cause errors in such products, including feature artefacts. We introduce a new method for reducing differential biases across the SST constellation, by reconciling the brightness temperature (BT) calibration and SST retrieval parameters between sensors. We use the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) as reference sensors, and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the MetOp-A mission to bridge the gap between these references. Observations across a range of AVHRR zenith angles are matched with dual-view three-channel skin SST retrievals from the AATSR and SLSTR. These skin SSTs act as the harmonization reference for AVHRR retrievals by optimal estimation (OE). Parameters for the harmonized AVHRR OE are iteratively determined, including BT bias corrections and observation error covariance matrices as functions of water-vapor path. The OE SSTs obtained from AVHRR are shown to be closely consistent with the reference sensor SSTs. Independent validation against drifting buoy SSTs shows that the AVHRR OE retrieval is stable across the reference-sensor gap. We discuss that this method is suitable to improve consistency across the whole constellation of SST sensors. The approach will help stabilize and reduce errors in future SST CDRs, as well as having application to other domains of remote sensing.

TI  - ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM, POPULISM, AND MOTIVATED RESISTANCE TO EXPERT CONSENSUS
T2  - PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have maintained that public attitudes often diverge from expert consensus due to ideology-driven motivated reasoning. However, this is not a sufficient explanation for less salient and politically charged questions. More attention needs to be given to anti-intellectualism-the generalized mistrust of intellectuals and experts. Using data from the General Social Survey and a survey of 3,600 Americans on Amazon Mechanical Turk, I provide evidence of a strong association between anti-intellectualism and opposition to scientific positions on climate change, nuclear power, GMOs, and water fluoridation, particularly for respondents with higher levels of political interest. Second, a survey experiment shows that anti-intellectualism moderates the acceptance of expert consensus cues such that respondents with high levels of anti-intellectualism actually increase their opposition to these positions in response. Third, evidence shows anti-intellectualism is connected to populism, a worldview that sees political conflict as primarily between ordinary citizens and a privileged societal elite. Exposure to randomly assigned populist rhetoric, even that which does not pertain to experts directly, primes anti-intellectual predispositions among respondents in the processing of expert consensus cues. These findings suggest that rising anti-elite rhetoric may make anti-intellectual sentiment more salient in information processing.

TI  - Categorical versus dimensional thinking: improving anti-stigma campaigns by matching health message frames and implicit worldviews
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite growing applications of social and healthcare marketing to enhance public well-being through anti-stigma campaigns, little research investigates how public stigma surrounding health conditions might limit the outcomes of these campaigns. By drawing on the theory of implicit worldviews, this study identifies reasons for public stigma as well as associated message frames to address these reasons. Study 1a provides evidence that implicit worldviews are relevant to campaign results. Study 1b and Study 2 demonstrate that fitting consumers' implicit worldview with suitable (i.e., biomedical or biopsychosocial) health frames reduces stigma endorsement. Study 3 identifies the perceived severity of a mental illness as a boundary condition; marketing communications have the greatest impact when they refer to an illness with lower perceived severity. Finally, Study 4 expands understanding of the phenomenon by extending the findings to physical health conditions (i.e., obesity). The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for policy and future applications.

TI  - Comparison of Image Fusion Techniques Using <i>Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre</i> (SPOT) 6 Satellite Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Preservation of spectral and spatial information is an important requirement for most quantitative remote sensing applications. In this study, we use image quality metrics to evaluate the performance of several image fusion techniques to assess the spectral and spatial quality of pansharpened images. We evaluated twelve pansharpening algorithms in this study; the Local Mean and Variance Matching (IMVM) algorithm was the best in terms of spectral consistency and synthesis followed by the ratio component substitution (RCS) algorithm. Whereas the IMVM and RCS image fusion techniques showed better results compared to other pansharpening methods, it is pertinent to highlight that our study also showed the credibility of other pansharpening algorithms in terms of spatial and spectral consistency as shown by the high correlation coefficients achieved in all methods. We noted that the algorithms that ranked higher in terms of spectral consistency and synthesis were outperformed by other competing algorithms in terms of spatial consistency. The study, therefore, concludes that the selection of image fusion techniques is driven by the requirements of remote sensing application and a careful trade-off is necessary to account for the impact of scene radiometry, image sharpness, spatial and spectral consistency, and computational overhead.

TI  - Between and betwixt: Catholic teachers in English secular schools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRISTIANITY & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article gives voice to Catholic teachers working in secular English schools. Their experience is an under-researched area and, despite a wealth of teaching on the vocation of the teacher, the specific vocation of the Catholic teacher in a secular school receives scant attention from the Catholic Church and researchers. Through in-depth interviews, participants articulated their idiographic experiences of inhabiting a liminal space. The main themes arising from the data were a strong sense of vocation, the absence of a metanarrative in the schools and the teachers' strong awareness of their Catholic identity. The findings challenge school leaders, the Catholic Church and the government to recognise the presence and experience of Catholic teachers in secular schools and to be attentive to their experiences and needs. The teachers themselves are challenged to acknowledge and value their own worldview and develop their understanding of the relationship between their religious commitment and their practice.

TI  - Surface urban heat islands in 57 cities across different climates in northern Fennoscandia
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is one of the most evident local climate phenomena in urbanized areas. Although much is known about the UHI in low- and mid-latitude cities, knowledge about the UHI in high latitudes is still fragmentary. Understanding this urban climate phenomenon in the high latitudes is essential to support sustainability and resilience of northern settlements that experience accelerated Arctic warming. This study focuses on Fennoscandia, which is the most urbanized northern region. Here, small and medium sized cities are numerous. The urban population is expected to grow as well as the importance of the region for the global resource supply and geopolitical arena. This study includes all 57 cities located above 64 degrees N in this complex region. Their combined urban population is of 1,700,000. The study is based on statistical analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in the period 2001-2017. The analysis of the LST data determines a surface UHI or SUHI. We find strong and persistent winter and summer SUHIs in most of the studied cities. The SUHI intensity varies from city to city. It is remarkably heterogeneous due to bioclimatic and socioeconomic differences between the cities. The SUHI is particularly intense in the coastal cities of the Atlantic region. Our analysis shows that the cities with warmer rural background and larger fraction of land covered by more productive vegetation (low albedo) around the cities have lower SUHI intensity. Conversely, the cities with colder background rural climate and less fraction of land with more productive vegetation (high albedo) have higher SUHI. Large thermal inertia of water bodies additionally complicates the determination and interpretation of the SUHI as both the relative strength and the direction of the urban effects (cooling or warming) depend on the fraction of water surfaces in the rural background. In this maritime climate zone, neither population nor the city area size reveal strong correlations with the SUHI intensity. The size of the population is found to be the strongest SUHI predictor in cities with more continental climate. The mean SUHI intensity is found in the range 0-5 degrees C. The intensity is larger for the largest cities of Murmansk and Oulu (3-5 degrees C).

TI  - On the Performances of Trend and Change-Point Detection Methods for Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting change-points and trends are common tasks in the analysis of remote sensing data. Over the years, many different methods have been proposed for those purposes, including (modified) Mann-Kendall and Cox-Stuart tests for detecting trends; and Pettitt, Buishand range, Buishand U, standard normal homogeneity (Snh), Meanvar, structure change (Strucchange), breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST), and hierarchical divisive (E.divisive) for detecting change-points. In this paper, we describe a simulation study based on including different artificial, abrupt changes at different time-periods of image time series to assess the performances of such methods. The power of the test, type I error probability, and mean absolute error (MAE) were used as performance criteria, although MAE was only calculated for change-point detection methods. The study reveals that if the magnitude of change (or trend slope) is high, and/or the change does not occur in the first or last time-periods, the methods generally have a high power and a low MAE. However, in the presence of temporal autocorrelation, MAE raises, and the probability of introducing false positives increases noticeably. The modified versions of the Mann-Kendall method for autocorrelated data reduce/moderate its type I error probability, but this reduction comes with an important power diminution. In conclusion, taking a trade-off between the power of the test and type I error probability, we conclude that the original Mann-Kendall test is generally the preferable choice. Although Mann-Kendall is not able to identify the time-period of abrupt changes, it is more reliable than other methods when detecting the existence of such changes. Finally, we look for trend/change-points in land surface temperature (LST), day and night, via monthly MODIS images in Navarre, Spain, from January 2001 to December 2018.

TI  - Crop Loss Evaluation Using Digital Surface Models from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are revolutionizing agriculture management methods. Remote sensing data, image analysis and Digital Surface Models derived from Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereopsis offer new and fast methods to detect the needs of crops, greatly improving crops efficiency. In this study, we present a tool to detect and estimate crop damage after a disturbance (i.e., weather event, wildlife attacks or fires). The types of damage that are addressed in this study affect crop structure (i.e., plants are bent or gone), in the shape of depressions in the crop canopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four unsupervised methods based on terrain analyses, for the detection of damaged crops in UAV 3D models: slope detection, variance analysis, geomorphology classification and cloth simulation filter. A full workflow was designed and described in this article that involves the postprocessing of the raw results from the terrain analyses, for a refinement in the detection of damages. Our results show that all four methods performed similarly well after postprocessing-reaching an accuracy above to 90%-in the detection of severe crop damage, without the need of training data. The results of this study suggest that the used methods are effective and independent of the crop type, crop damage and growth stage. However, only severe damages were detected with this workflow. Other factors such as data volume, processing time, number of processing steps and spatial distribution of targets and errors are discussed in this article for the selection of the most appropriate method. Among the four tested methods, slope analysis involves less processing steps, generates the smallest data volume, is the fastest of methods and resulted in best spatial distribution of matches. Thus, it was selected as the most efficient method for crop damage detection.

TI  - Evaluating estimated sediment delivery by Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Sediment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) in the Talar Watershed, Iran
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) as the most widely used soil erosion model is a challenging issue. Accordingly, the objective of this study is investigating the estimated sediment delivery by the RUSLE method and Sediment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model. To this end, the Talar watershed in Iran was selected as the study area. Further, 700 paired sediment-discharge measurements at Valikbon and Shirgah-Talar hydrometric stations between the years 1991 and 2011 were collected and used in sediment rating curves. Nine procedures were investigated to produce the required RUSLE layers. The estimated soil erosion by RUSLE was evaluated using sediment rating curve data by two methods including least squares and quantile regression. The average annual suspended sediment load was calculated for each sub-watershed of the study area using the SEDD model. Afterwards, a sediment rating curve was estimated by least squares and quantile regression methods using paired discharge-sediment data. The average annual suspended sediment load values were calculated for two hydrometric stations and were further evaluated by the SEDD model. The results indicated that the first considered procedure, which utilized 15-min rainfall measurements for the rainfall factor (R), and the classification method of SENTINEL-2 MSI image for the cover management factor (C), offered the best results in producing RUSLE layers. Furthermore, the results revealed the advantages of utilizing satellite images in producing cover management layer, which is required in the RUSLE method.

TI  - Detection of coffee berry necrosis by digital image processing of landsat 8 oli satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee berry necrosis is a fungal disease that, at a high level, significantly affects coffee productivity. With the advent of surface mapping satellites, it was possible to obtain information about the spectral signature of the crop on a time scale pertinent to the monitoring and detection of plant phenological changes. The objective of this paper was to define the best machine learning algorithm that is able to classify the incidence CBN as a function of Landsat 8 OLI images in different atmospheric correction methods. Landsat 8 OLI images were acquired at the dates closest to sampling anthracnose field data at three times corresponding to grain filling period and were submitted to atmospheric corrections by DOS, ATCOR, and 6SV methods. The images classified by the algorithms of machine learning, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and Naive Bayes were tested 30 times in random sampling. Given the overall accuracy of each test, the algorithms were evaluated using the Friedman and Nemenyi tests to identify the statistical difference in the treatments. The obtained results indicated that the overall accuracy and the balanced accuracy index were on an average around 0.55 and 0.45, respectively, for the Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms in the ATCOR atmospheric correction. According to the Friedman and Nemenyi tests, both algorithms were defined as the best classifiers. These results demonstrate that Landsat 8 OLI images were able to identify an incidence of the coffee berry necrosis by means of machine learning techniques, a fact that cannot be observed by the Pearson correlation.

TI  - Realistic and simplified models of plant and leaf area indices for a seasonally dry tropical forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) models that consider all phenological stages have not been developed for the Caatinga, the largest seasonally dry tropical forest in South America. LAI models that are currently used show moderate to high covariance when compared to in situ data, but they often lack accuracy in the whole spectra of possible values and do not consider the impact that the stems and branches have over LAI estimates, which is of great influence in the Caatinga. In this study, we develop and assess PAI (Plant Area Index) and LAI models by using ground-based measurements and satellite (Landsat) data. The objective of this study was to create and test new empirical models using a multi-year and multi-source of reflectance data. The study was based on measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) from above and below the canopy during the periods of 2011-2012 and 2016-2018. Through iterative processing, we obtained more than a million candidate models for estimating PAI and LAI. To dean up the small discrepancies in the extremes of each interpolated series, we smoothed out the dataset by fitting a logarithmic equation with the PAI data and the inverse contribution of WAI (Wood Area Index) to PAL that is the portion of PAI that is actually LAI (LAI(C)). LAI(C) can be calculated as follows: LAI(C) = 1 - (WAI/PAI)). We subtracted the WAI values from the PAI to develop our in situ LAI dataset that was used for further analysis. Our in situ dataset was also used as a reference to compare our models with four other models used for the Caatinga, as well as the MODIS-derived LAI products (MCD15A3H/A2H). Our main findings were as follows: (i) Six models use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) as input, and performed well, with r(2) ranging from 0.77 to 0.79 (PAI) and 0.76 to 0.81 (LAI), and RMSE with a minimum of 0.41 m(2) m(-2) (PAI) and 0.40 m(2) m(-2) (LAI). The SAVI models showed values 20% and 32% (PAI), and 21% and 15% (LAI) smaller than those found for the models that use EVI and NDVI, respectively; (ii) the other models (ten) use only two bands, and in contrast to the first six models, these new models may abstract other physical processes and components, such as leaves etiolation and increasing protochlorophyll. The developed models used the near-infrared band, and they varied only in relation to the inclusion of the red, green, and blue bands. (iii) All previously published models and MODIS-LAI underperformed against our calibrated models. Our study was able to provide several PAI and LAI models that realistically represent the phenology of the Caatinga.

TI  - Comparative and Functional Genomic Resource for Mechanistic Studies of Human Blood Pressure-Associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
T2  - HYPERTENSION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the current study is to use comparative and functional genomic analysis to help to understand the biological mechanism mediating the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on blood pressure. We mapped 26 585 SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium with 1071 human blood pressure-associated sentinel SNPs to 9447 syntenic regions in the mouse genome. Approximately 21.8% of the 1071 linkage disequilibrium regions are located at least 10 kb from any protein-coding gene. Approximately 300 blood pressure-associated SNPs are expression quantitative trait loci for a few dozen known blood pressure physiology genes in tissues including specific kidney regions. Blood pressure-associated sentinel SNPs are significantly enriched for expression quantitative trait loci for blood pressure physiology genes compared with randomly selected SNPs (P<0.00023, Fisher exact test). Using a newly developed deep learning method and other methods, we identified SNPs that were predicted to influence the conservation of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) binding across cell types, transcription factor binding, mRNA splicing, or secondary structures of RNA including long noncoding RNA. The SNPs were more likely to be located in CTCF-binding regions than what would be expected from the whole genome (P=4.90x10(-7), Pearson chi(2) test). One example synonymous SNP rs9337951 was predicted to influence the secondary structure of its host mRNA JCAD (junctional cadherin 5 associated) and was experimentally validated to influence JCAD protein expression. These findings provide an extensive comparative and functional genomic resource for developing experiments to test the functional significance of human blood pressure-associated SNPs in human cells and animal models.

AB  - Objective To validate a case definition for speech and language disorders in community-dwelling older adults and to determine the prevalence of speech and language disorders in a primary care population.Design This is a combined case definition validation and cross-sectional prevalence study. Chart review was considered the reference standard and was used to estimate prevalence. This study used de-identified electronic medical record data from participating SAPCReN-CPCSSN (Southern Alberta Primary Care Research Network-Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network) primary care clinics.Setting Southern Alberta.Participants Men and women aged 55 years and older who had visited a SAPCReN-CPCSSN physician or nurse practitioner at least once in the 2 years before the beginning of the study.Main outcome measures Validation analysis included estimation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Prevalence was the other main outcome measure.Results The prevalence of speech and language disorders within the sample of 1384 patients was 1.2%. The case definition had a favourable specificity (99.9%, 95% CI 99.6% to 100.0%), positive predictive value (75.6%, 95% CI 25.4% to 96.6%), and negative predictive value (99.0%, 95% CI 98.8% to 99.2%). Sensitivity was not sufficient for validity (18.8%, 95% CI 4.05% to 45.6%).Conclusion The case definition did not meet an acceptable standard for validity and thus cannot be used for future epidemiologic research. However, owing to the case definition's high positive predictive value, it might be useful for clinical purposes and for cohort studies. Finally, white the case definition did not prove valid, this study has provided a conservative estimate of prevalence (1.2%) given the case definition's high specificity.

TI  - INCORPORATING KENAF AND OIL PALM NANOCELLULOSE IN BUILDING MATERIALS FOR INDOOR RADON GAS EMANATION REDUCTION
T2  - RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to reduce radon gas emanations in the indoor environment by incorporating kenaf and oil palm nanocellulose that act as nano-fillers into building materials. Fabrication of composite brick was carried out according to the MS and ASTM standards. In this research, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 200 ml of nanocellulose were used to replace the usage of sand, stone and cement materials, respectively. Kenaf and oil palm nanocellulose were utilised to reduce the internal and surface porosity as well as to replace the radon resources (stone), which indirectly reduced radon gas emanation. Radon gas emanated from each composite brick was measured within 10 consecutive days in an airtight prototype Perspex room using Radon Monitor Sentinel 1030. A compression test was also carried out to investigate the physical strength of the fabricated composite bricks. The results showed that 40 ml of kenaf and oil palm nanocellulose was the optimum amount in reducing the radon concentration, where the radon readings were 1.4 and 0.93 pCi per l, respectively. Meanwhile, the brick with no nanocellulose exhibited the highest radon reading of 3.77 pCi per l. Moreover, the Young modulus for the composite brick of both kenaf and oil palm nanocellulose was 28.92 and 27.8 N per mm(2) compared to the control brick, which was 27 N per mm(2). The results proved that radon gas emanations were reduced by 62.86% for kenaf and 75.3% for oil palm by incorporating the organic nanocellulose, which has high potential towards a healthy indoor environment.

TI  - Do remotely-sensed vegetation health indices explain credit risk in agricultural microfinance?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers' vulnerability to adverse weather events, which are likely to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change, is a major impediment to a sufficient credit supply. Smallholder farmers' access to credit is, among other factors, crucial for productivity and output growth. Index insurance could help lenders to compensate for lacking installment payments in years with severe weather conditions and, thus, is considered to accelerate agricultural lending. Using a unique borrower dataset provided by a Microfinance Institution (MFI) in Madagascar, we analyze whether remotely-sensed vegetation health indices can explain the credit risk of the MFI's agricultural loan portfolio. Therefore, we utilize sequential logit models and quantile regressions. More specifically, we consider the remotely-sensed Vegetation Condition Index, Temperature Condition Index and the Vegetation Health Index as independent variables at the individual branch and the aggregated bank level. These indices are available globally and can potentially enhance the effectiveness of index insurance by reducing basis risk (imperfect correlation between the index and the underlying exposure), a major drawback of index insurance. Moreover, we consider loan- and socio-demographic variables of the borrowers as additional independent variables. Our results show that the credit risk of the MFI is explained, to a large extent, by the vegetation health indices. Moreover, the results from quantile regressions show that the explanatory power of the vegetation health indices increases with increasing credit risk. Thus, utilizing remotely-sensed vegetation health indices for index insurance designs might be particularly valuable for MFIs to hedge the credit risk of their agricultural loan portfolio. Facing lower default rates, MFIs could reduce interest rates. Remotely-sensed index insurance could therefore enhance access to credit, contributing to sustainable development in the study region.

TI  - A blended census and multiscale remote sensing approach to probabilistic cropland mapping in complex landscapes
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are used to map the extent of croplands. They are especially useful in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where landscapes are complex and farms are small, i.e. less than two ha. In this study, a hierarchical remote sensing approach was developed to estimate field fractions at 30 m spatial resolution in a highly fragmented agricultural region of Ethiopia. The landscape was stratified into crop production system (CPS) zones with ten-day SPOT Proba-V 1 km normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites. The CPS zones were used to disaggregate agricultural census statistics to 1 km field fractions and mask "wet" and "dry" seasons. Long-term average wet-dry season NDVI and topographic information derived from 30 m Landsat-8 (OLI) surface reflectance and the SRTM digital elevation model were combined with 1 km field fractions in a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to produce the field fractions. Sample dot grids were manually interpreted from very high-resolution DigitalGlobe imagery on the Google Earth platform for training and testing. The model yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.71 and R-2 of 0.65 in the holdout sample set. The high AUC reveals the model was effective at classifying 30 m pixels as "crop" or "not crop" while the high R-2 indicated leveraging at the extremes (100 and 0% probability), meaning at 30 m resolution, subpixel variations were difficult to discern. The improved model skill compared to previous cropland mapping studies using GAMs can be attributed to the stratification and decomposition of the Landsat time series using CPS-defined phenology. Additional remote sensing model inputs, such as Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 red-edge reflectance, could provide additional explanatory power. Wall-to-wall national coverage for agricultural production estimation or other food security related application could be achieved by manually digitizing additional sample data in other regions of Ethiopia or using existing crowd-sourced databases, such as Geo-Wiki.

TI  - Risks to water resources and development of a management strategy in the river basins of the Hengduan Mountains, Southwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to disclose the water resource risks influenced by climate extremes and human activities and therefore to propose a management strategy for the river basins (Lancang and Jinsha rivers) in the Hengduan Mountains, Southwest China. In this study, a slope changing ratio of cumulative quantity (SCRCQ) approach is introduced to separate the contributions of climate change and human activities from runoff changes, and to propose a conceptual model to secure a management strategy under the implications of the changing environment, based on these datasets, including observation climate and runoff data, satellite remote sensing images (MODIS and Landsat) and the observed land use data. Through this investigation, the following results were achieved. Firstly, the annual average runoff exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend from upstream to downstream over the Lancang and Jinsha rivers with a change rate of -26.3 mm/10 year, the runoff had a sharp decrease in drought years, especially in 1984, 2006 and 2009 by 26%, 28% and 24%, respectively, at the Jiajiu station. Secondly, the cropland decreased by 803 Km(2) and the forestland increased by 423 Km(2) which finally resulted in a significant decline in runoff, the change rate was -15 mm per year (4%) and -71 mm per year (8%) over the Lancang and Jinsha river basins, respectively from 2000 to 2010. Thirdly, the average observed runoff in the "pre-dam" period (1980-1992) increased by 7% in the "post-dam" period (1993-2015). Improving the weather modifications and water-saving technology can help retain water resources in the rainy seasons to relieve drought in the dry seasons. Finally, a comprehensive assessment model was applied to select plant species in the ecological restoration areas, which have implications for environmental protection, water resource management and ecological restoration in the rivers of southwest China.

TI  - Lake Volume Data Analyses: A Deep Look into the Shrinking and Expansion Patterns of Lakes Azuei and Enriquillo, Hispaniola
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the development of an evenly spaced volume time series for Lakes Azuei and Enriquillo both located on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The time series is derived from an unevenly spaced Landsat imagery data set which is then exposed to several imputation methods to construct the gap filled uniformly-spaced time series so it can be subjected to statistical analyses methods. The volume time series features both gradual and sudden changes the latter of which is attributed to North Atlantic cyclone activity. Relevant cyclone activity is defined as an event passing within 80 km and having regional monthly rainfall averages higher than a threshold value of 87 mm causing discontinuities in the lake responses. Discontinuities are accounted for in the imputation algorithm by dividing the time series into two sub-sections: Before/after the event. Using leave-p-out cross-validation and computing the NRMSE index the Stineman interpolation proves to be the best algorithm among 15 different imputation alternatives that were tested. The final time series features 16-day intervals which is subsequently resampled into one with monthly time steps. Data analyses of the monthly volume change time series show Lake Enriquillo's seasonal periodicity in its behavior and also its sensitivity due to the occurrence of storm events. Response times feature a growth pattern lasting for one to two years after an extreme event, followed by a shrinking pattern lasting 5-7 years returning the lake to its original state. While both lakes show a remarkable long term increase in size starting in 2005, Lake Azuei is different in that it is much less sensitive to storm events and instead shows a stronger response to just changing seasonal rainfall patterns.

TI  - Incorporation and Use of Earth Remote Sensing Imagery within the NOAA/NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe weather events including tornadoes, damaging winds, hail, and their combination produce changes in land surface vegetation and urban settings that are frequently observed through remote sensing. Capabilities continue to improve through a growing constellation of governmental and commercial assets, increasing the spatial resolution of visible, near to shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared remote sensing. Here, we highlight cases where visual interpretation of imagery benefitted severe weather damage assessments made within the NOAA/NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit. Examples demonstrate utility of imagery in assessing tracks and changes in remote areas where staffing limitations or access prevent a ground-based assessment.

TI  - Using remote sensing products to predict recovery of vegetation across space and time following energy development
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using localized studies to understand how ecosystems recover can create uncertainty in recovery predictions across landscapes. Large archives of remote sensing data offer opportunities for quantifying the spatial and temporal factors influencing recovery at broad scales and predicting recovery. For example, energy production is a widespread and expanding land use among many semi-arid ecosystems of the Western United States dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), a keystone species providing a variety of ecological services. With remotely-sensed (Landsat) estimates of vegetation cover collected every 2-5 years from southwestern Wyoming, USA, over nearly three decades (1985-2015), we modeled changes in sagebrush cover on 375 former oil and gas well pads in response to weather and site-level conditions. We then used modeled relationships to predict recovery time across the landscape as an indicator of resilience for vegetation after well pad disturbances, where faster recovery indicates a greater capacity to recover when similarly disturbed. We found the rate of change in sagebrush cover generally increased with moisture and temperature, particularly at higher elevations. Rate of change in sagebrush cover also increased and decreased with greater percent sand and larger well pads, respectively. We predicted 21% of the landscape would recover to pre-disturbance conditions within 60 years, whereas other areas may require > 100 years for recovery. These predictions and maps could inform future restoration efforts as they reflect resilience. This approach also is applicable to other disturbance types (e.g., fires and vegetation removal treatments) across landscapes, which can further improve conservation efforts by characterizing past conditions and monitoring trends in subsequent years.

TI  - Postmastectomy radiation therapy in early breast cancer: Utility or futility?
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) has been shown to reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR), in patients with locally advanced breast cancer who are considered of high-risk because of large tumors (> 5 cm) or presence of axillary lymph-node involvement, as well as to reduce breast cancer mortality. However, controversy still remains with respect to indication of PMRT in case of early-stages invasive tumors. This review aims to analyze the impact that PMRT has on final results in women with breast tumors in different scenarios that would otherwise be considered as early breast cancer, such as extensive DCIS, tumors without axillary lymph-node involvement or with minimal microscopic nodal-involvement. The existence of risk factors including young age, premenopausal status, and presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), high grade or tumor size > 2 cm has been associated with an increased risk of LRR in these patients at early-stages and advises to consider PMRT in selected cases.

TI  - Scalable Bayesian Inference for the Inverse Temperature of a Hidden Potts Model
T2  - BAYESIAN ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inverse temperature parameter of the Potts model governs the strength of spatial cohesion and therefore has a major influence over the resulting model fit. A difficulty arises from the dependence of an intractable normalising constant on the value of this parameter and thus there is no closed-form solution for sampling from the posterior distribution directly. There is a variety of computational approaches for sampling from the posterior without evaluating the normalising constant, including the exchange algorithm and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). A serious drawback of these algorithms is that they do not scale well for models with a large state space, such as images with a million or more pixels. We introduce a parametric surrogate model, which approximates the score function using an integral curve. Our surrogate model incorporates known properties of the likelihood, such as heteroskedasticity and critical temperature. We demonstrate this method using synthetic data as well as remotely-sensed imagery from the Landsat-8 satellite. We achieve up to a hundredfold improvement in the elapsed runtime, compared to the exchange algorithm or ABC. An open-source implementation of our algorithm is available in the R package bayesImageS.

TI  - Steady infiltration rate spatial modeling from remote sensing data and terrain attributes in southeast Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to describe the development of steady infiltration rate (SIR) spatial prediction models using accessible input data. The models were created from SIR data collected through simulated rainfall at 71 points in part of the Cachimbal stream watershed (a Paraiba do Sul River tributary watershed) in Rio de Janeiro state-Brazil, using as covariates: terrain attributes derived from digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing data and soil class, physical and chemical attributes maps. Itwas discussed how different land uses and soil degradation levels affect SIR and how NDVI can be used to represent themon SIR modeling. Among the soil physical properties, bulk density (BD) and total sand (TS) were selected as covariates. SIR was higherwhen lower the bulk density and higher the sand content. Soil types play a big role in SIR, highlighting the Gleissolos Haplicos (Gleysols) as the soil class that presented the lower average SIR values and the Latossolos Vermelho Amarelos and Nitossolos Haplicos (Ferralsols and Nitisols) that presented the highest. Topographic position Index (TPI), curvature, and TopographicWetness Index (TWI) were the terrain covariates used in the models. Their usage indicate lower SIR in concave, lower and wetter parts of the landscape. The results demonstrated that is possible to achieve satisfactory results for SIR spatialmodeling using easily accessible data (remote sensing and terrain attributes), but soil information is also necessary to develop better prediction models.

TI  - Mapping Forest Canopy Fuels in the Western United States with LiDAR-Landsat Covariance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive spatial coverage of forest canopy fuels is relied upon by fire management in the US to predict fire behavior, assess risk, and plan forest treatments. Here, a collection of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets from the western US are fused with Landsat-derived spectral indices to map the canopy fuel attributes needed for wildfire predictions: canopy cover (CC), canopy height (CH), canopy base height (CBH), and canopy bulk density (CBD). A single, gradient boosting machine (GBM) model using data from all landscapes is able to characterize these relationships with only small reductions in model performance (mean 0.04 reduction in R-2) compared to local GBM models trained on individual landscapes. Model evaluations on independent LiDAR datasets show the single global model outperforming local models (mean 0.24 increase in R-2), indicating improved model generality. The global GBM model significantly improves performance over existing LANDFIRE canopy fuels data products (R-2 ranging from 0.15 to 0.61 vs. -3.94 to -0.374). The ability to automatically update canopy fuels following wildfire disturbance is also evaluated, and results show intuitive reductions in canopy fuels for high and moderate fire severity classes and little to no change for unburned to low fire severity classes. Improved canopy fuel mapping and the ability to apply the same predictive model on an annual basis enhances forest, fuel, and fire management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Wildfires in the Forest Tundra of Western Siberia
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate change that has taken place in recent decades has significantly increased the threat of the occurrence and distribution of wildfires in northwestern Siberia. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of fires and their relationship with climate and vegetation in this area. As a result of processing Landsat satellite images for 1985-2017, it was determined that 10.5% of the Western Siberia forest tundra was exposed to fires. The maximum relative area of burned forests (23%) was found in larch and spruce-larch lichen woodlands. One geobotanical indicator of increased fire hazard is the dominance of synusiae of epigeic lichens in the vegetation cover. It is shown that most of the severely burned areas were distributed in the central part of the forest tundra within the largest gas fields. Our results have shown a positive significant correlation between square of areas burned and summer temperature regime (average and maximum summer temperatures) and a negative correlation between burned areas and the amount of summer precipitation. A dendrochronological analysis showed that the frequency of fires varied from 15 to 60 years (an average of about 30 years).

TI  - Current and novel mapping substances in gynecologic cancer care
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Many tracers have been introduced into current medical practice with the purpose of improving lymphatic mapping techniques, anatomic visualization, and organ/tissue perfusion assessment. Among them, three tracers have dominated the field: indocyanine green, technetium-99m radiocolloid (Tc99(m)), and blue dye. Tc99(m) and blue dye are used individually or in combination; however, given particular challenges with these tracers, such as the need for a preoperative procedure by nuclear medicine and cost, other options have been sought. Indocyanine green has proven to be a promising alternative for certain procedures, as it is easy to use and has quick uptake. Its use in the management of gynecologic cancers was first described for sentinel lymph node mapping in cervical cancer, and later for endometrial and vulvar cancers. This review provides an in-depth look at these mapping substances, their uses, and the potential for new discoveries.

Hyperspectral remote sensing is an effective means to discriminate plant species, providing possibilities to track such weed invasions and improve precision agriculture. However, essential baseline information using remotely sensed data is missing, specifically for the Striga weed in Africa. In this study, we investigated the spectral uniqueness of Striga compared to other co-occurring maize crops and weeds. We used the in-situ FieldSpec (R) Handheld 2 (TM) analytical spectral device (ASD), hyperspectral data and their respective narrow-band indices in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) and four machine learning discriminant algorithms (i.e. random forest: RF, linear discriminant analysis: LDA, gradient boosting: GB and support vector machines: SVM) to discriminate among different levels of Striga (Striga hermonthica) infestations in maize fields in western Kenya. We also tested the utility of Sentinel-2 waveband configurations to map and discriminate Striga infestation in heterogenous cereal crop fields. The in-situ hyperspectral reflectance data were resampled to the spectral waveband configurations of Sentinel-2 using published spectral response functions. We sampled and detected seven Striga infestation classes based on three flowering Striga classes (low, moderate and high) against two background endmembers (soil and a mixture of maize and other co-occurring weeds). A guided regularized random forest (GRRF) algorithm was used to select the most relevant hyperspectral wavebands and vegetation indices (VIs) as well as for the resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands for Striga infestation discrimination. The performance of the four discriminant algorithms was compared using classification accuracy assessment metrics. We were able to positively discriminate Striga from the two background endmembers i.e. soil and co-occurring vegetation (maize and co-occurring weeds) based on the few GRRF selected hyperspectral vegetation indices and the GRRF selected resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. RF outperformed all the other discriminant methods and produced the highest overall accuracy of 91% and 85%, using the hyperspectral and resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands, respectively, across the four different discriminant models tested in this study. The class with the highest detection accuracy across all the four discriminant algorithms, was the "exclusively maize and other co-occurring weeds" (>70%). The GRRF reduced the dimensionality of the hyperspectral data and selected only 9 most relevant wavebands out of 750 wavebands, 6 VIs out of 15 and 6 out of 10 resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands for discriminating among the Striga and co-occurring classes. Resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral wavebands 3 (green) and 4 (red) were the most crucial for Striga detection. The use of the most relevant hyperspectral features (i.e. wavebands and VIs) significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the overall classification accuracy and Kappa scores (+/- 5% and +/- 0.2, respectively) in all the machine learning discriminant models. Our results show the potential of hyperspectral, resampled Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and machine learning discriminant algorithms as a tool to accurately discern Striga in heterogenous maize agro-ecological systems.

TI  - Assessing the fidelity of Landsat-based fAPAR models in two diverse sugarcane growing regions
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is a globally important crop used for producing sugar and for generating renewable energy. Timely and accurate forecasts of sugarcane yield and production are needed to optimize supply chain operations. Crop growth models (CGMs) are frequently used for sugarcane yield forecasting and have been shown to benefit from using remotely sensed data to force (calibrate) biophysical state variables, such as the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR). Little is known about the robustness of multispectral vegetation indices for modelling fAPAR in sugarcane growing regions were environmental conditions and farming practices are diverse. This study investigated how the relationships between multispectral Landsat-8 satellite imagery and in situ sugarcane fAPAR measurements vary over large heterogeneous areas. Specifically, it examined which spectral bands and indices are most appropriate for modelling fAPAR under particular production environments and assessed the robustness of the models for application in areas where sugarcane is grown under varying agroclimatic conditions. It was found that cropping and environmental conditions were the main drivers of sugarcane fAPAR modelling success. Significantly (40%) lower mean root mean squared errors (RMSEs) values were recorded in Pongola, which is attributed to the relatively homogenous conditions under which sugarcane is being grown in this area. Generally, the Sezela models were much weaker and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) models performed relatively poorly, with the best performing models being dominated by the SWIR bands and/or indices generated from it. The non-linear models dominated and are thus recommended for operational implementation owing to their relative simplicity and robustness. From these results we conclude that the use of remotely sensed data for estimating fAPAR throughout the growing season is highly beneficial, but that the selection of suitable variable (index) is critical, especially when the sugarcane area being considered is diverse in terms of farming practices, terrain and climate.

TI  - The end of gunpoint conservation: forest disturbance after the Colombian peace agreement
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2016, after 52 years of armed conflict, the Colombian government and the primary rebel group, the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) reached a peace agreement. The agreement incorporated three changes to institutions governing forest land occupation and use: (a) the demobilization of FARC from forested places, (2) the future distribution of legal land titles and new road construction into forests, and (3) the eradication of illicit crops. However, we document unprecedented rates of forest disturbance in the months following the peace agreement in biodiversity hotspots across the country. Are the declaration of peace and the increased rates of forest disturbance related? Here, we present the first systematic assessment of the impact of the Colombian peace agreement on forest disturbance. Focusing on the Andes-Amazon Transition Belt (AATB), we used automated satellite image disturbance detection methods and ethnographic data to quantify and interpret forest cover change from 2010 to 2018 that span wartime, peace negotiation, and post-peace agreement stages. Our findings indicate that during the post-peace agreement period (2017-2018), the area of forest disturbance increased by 50% (about 238 000 ha) across the AATB in comparison with the four-year peace negotiation stage (2013-2016); these changes reflect the end of FARC-led gunpoint conservation in the region. Forest disturbance also spread deeper into the Amazon watershed and increased in area by 187% within the AATB's protected areas. We find that following the peace agreement and the withdrawal of FARC, key actors (viz. drug cartels, large landowners, campesinos and dissidents) with expectations of favorable land tenure policies swept into the region; this led to increases in large-scale cattle ranching, coca cultivation dispersal, and speculative illegal land markets each of which contributed to the widespread forest disturbance that we mapped. The rapid increase in forest disturbance occurred despite the interest of the international community in promoting forest conservation initiatives in the AATB and Colombia's existing conservation and land titling frameworks for public lands. Our findings underscore the need for conservation strategies sensitive to rapid institutional and demographic changes in the course of the peace agreement to prevent forests from becoming an unexpected casualty of premature and unstable peace.

TI  - Survey of Community Livelihoods and Landscape Change along the Nzhelele and Levuvhu River Catchments in Limpopo Province, South Africa
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape-change studies have attracted increasing interest because of their importance to land management and the sustainable livelihoods of rural communities. However, empirical studies on landscape change and its drivers are often poorly understood, particularly, in small rural communities in developing countries such as South Africa. The present study surveyed local community livelihoods and perceptions of landscape change in the Nzhelele and Levuvhu river catchments in Limpopo Province, South Africa. These areas have experienced land reform and are also characterized by environmental degradation, poverty, inequality and environmental justice concerns among other issues. Land-cover maps derived from Landsat satellite imagery were used for purposes of correlating and validating the survey data findings and results. The survey results showed that education levels, working status and marital status have statistically significant effects on community livelihoods (indicated by levels of income, p < 0.05). Maize, fruits and vegetables are the main cultivated crop varieties in the study area, and these crops are mainly used for subsistence to meet household self-consumption requirements. Moreover, local community members and stakeholders argue that the landscape has changed over the past 20 years mainly as a result of urban expansion, deforestation, agricultural diversification and forestry intensification. These landscape changes were largely confirmed by the land-cover change maps derived from satellite imagery. Soil erosion as a result of landscape changes was identified as a major threat and hazard in the study area. Political, natural, economic and cultural factors have been identified as the major underlying drivers for the observed landscape changes. These results have implications for understanding landscape change, coupled with human-nature relationships as well as informing government policy with respect to advancing land management and further promotion of the sustainable livelihoods of rural communities. Overall, the study proposes a multiple stakeholders' approach and ecosystem-based approach to promote the sustainable management of landscapes in rural areas.

TI  - Validation of ASTER Emissivity Retrieval Using the Mako Airborne TIR Imaging Spectrometer at the Algodones Dune Field in Southern California, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of emissivity (epsilon) retrievals from spaceborne thermal infrared (TIR) sensors typically requires spatial extrapolations over several orders of magnitude for a comparison between centimeter-scale laboratory epsilon measurements and the common decameter and lower resolution of spaceborne TIR data. In the case of NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) temperature and epsilon separation algorithm (TES), this extrapolation becomes especially challenging because TES was originally designed for the geologic surface of Earth, which is typically heterogeneous even at centimeter and decameter scales. Here, we used the airborne TIR hyperspectral Mako sensor with its 2.2 m/pixel resolution, to bridge this scaling issue and robustly link between ASTER TES 90 m/pixel emissivity retrievals and laboratory epsilon measurements from the Algodones dune field in southern California, USA. The experimental setup included: (i) Laboratory XRD, grain size, and TIR spectral measurements; (ii) radiosonde launches at the time of the two Mako overpasses for atmospheric corrections; (iii) ground-based thermal measurements for calibration, and (iv) analyses of ASTER day and night epsilon retrievals from 21 different acquisitions. We show that while cavity radiation leads to a 2% to 4% decrease in the effective emissivity contrast of fully resolved scene elements (e.g., slipface slopes and interdune flats), spectral variability of the site when imaged at 90 m/pixel is below 1%, because at this scale the dune field becomes an effectively homogeneous mixture of the different dune elements. We also found that adsorption of atmospheric moisture to grain surfaces during the predawn hours increased the effective epsilon of the dune surface by up to 0.04. The accuracy of ASTER's daytime emissivity retrievals using each of the three available atmospheric correction protocols was better than 0.01 and within the target performance of ASTER's standard emissivity product. Nighttime emissivity retrievals had lower precision (<0.03) likely due to residual atmospheric effects. The water vapor scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction protocol was required to obtain accurate (<0.01) nighttime ASTER emissivity retrievals.

TI  - Impact of Satellite and In Situ Data Assimilation on Hydrological Predictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of different satellite and in situ products generally improves the hydrological model predictive skill. Most studies have focused on assimilating a single product at a time with the ensemble size subjectively chosen by the modeller. In this study, we used the European-scale Hydrological Predictions for the Environment hydrological model in the Umealven catchment in northern Sweden with the stream discharge and local reservoir inflow as target variables to objectively choose an ensemble size that optimised model performance when the ensemble Kalman filter method is used. We further assessed the effect of assimilating different satellite products; namely, snow water equivalent, fractional snow cover, and actual and potential evapotranspiration, as well as in situ measurements of river discharge and local reservoir inflows. We finally investigated the combinations of those products that improved model predictions of the target variables and how the model performance varied through the year for those combinations. We found that an ensemble size of 50 was sufficient for all products except the reservoir inflow, which required 100 members and that in situ products outperform satellite products when assimilated. In particular, potential evapotranspiration alone or as combinations with other products did not generally improve predictions of our target variables. However, assimilating combinations of the snow products, discharge and local reservoir without evapotranspiration products improved the model performance.

TI  - Assessing factors impacting the spatial discrepancy of remote sensing based cropland products: A case study in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many African countries are facing increasing risks of food insecurity due to rising populations. Accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution of cropland is critical for the effective management of crop production and yield forecast. Most recent cropland products (2015 and 2016) derived from multi-source remote sensing data are available for public use. However, discrepancies exist among these cropland products, and the level of discrepancy is particularly high in several Africa regions. The overall goal of this study was to identify and assess the driving factors contributing to the spatial discrepancies among four cropland products derived from remotely sensed data. A novel approach was proposed to evaluate the spatial agreement of these cropland products and assess the impact of environmental factors such as elevation dispersion, field size, land-cover richness and frequency of cloud cover on these spatial differences. Results from this study show that the overall accuracies of the four cropland products are below 65%. In particular, large disagreements are seen on datasets covering Sahel zone and along the West African coasts. This study has identified land-cover richness as the driving factor with the largest contribution to the spatial disagreement among cropland products over Africa, followed by the high frequency of cloud cover, small and fragmented field size, and elevation complexity. To improve the accuracy of future cropland products for African regions, the data producers are encouraged to take a multi-classification approach and incorporate multi-sensors into their cropland mapping processes.

TI  - Woody Cover Fractions in African Savannas From Landsat and High-Resolution Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The challenge of mapping savanna vegetation has limited our understanding of the factors that shape these ecosystems at large scales. We tested seven methods for mapping savanna woody cover (trees and shrubs; WC) across 12 protected areas (PAs) in eastern Africa using Landsat 8 imagery. Because we wanted a method viable for mapping across the often-limited Landsat historical archive, we limited ourselves to three images: one each from the wet, dry, and transition (halfway between wet and dry) seasons. Models were trained and tested using 1,330 WC reference points and the variance explained by cross validation (VEcv) accuracy metric. Of the methods we tested, RF significantly (p < 0.001) outperformed the others with the best models in nine PAs scoring over 75% (range of 34.5%-91.1%). RF models trained using data from all the PAs and tested in the individual PAs significantly (p < 0.001) outperformed their single-PA-derived counterparts (67.7 +/- 23.3% versus 30.5 +/- 27.4%). We also found that while the transition image appears to be critical to mapping WC and the wet season image should be avoided, no single season or seasonal combination significantly outperformed all the others, allowing some flexibility in image selection. Our findings show that with proper sampling of landscape heterogeneity, even with limited imagery, accurate maps of savanna WC are possible and could catalyze discoveries in this crucial biome.

TI  - Management Recommendations for Merkel Cell Carcinoma-A Danish Perspective
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare malignant neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin with a poor prognosis and an apparent increase in incidence. Due to its rarity, evidence-based guidelines are limited, and there is a lack of awareness among clinicians. This review constitutes the consensus management recommendations developed by the Danish MCC expert group and is based on a systematic literature search. Patients with localized disease are recommended surgical excision and adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site; however, this may be omitted in patients with MCC with low risk features. Patients with regional lymph node involvement are recommended complete lymph node removal and adjuvant radiotherapy in case of extracapsular disease. Metastatic disease was traditionally treated with chemotherapy, however, recent clinical trials with immune therapy have been promising. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) /programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) axis should therefore be strongly considered as first-line treatment for fit patients. A 5-year follow-up period is recommended involving clinical exam every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for the following 3 years and PET-CT one to two times a year or if clinically indicated. These national recommendations are intended to offer uniform patient treatment and hopefully improve prognosis.

TI  - Spirituality and effective factors in education: A qualitative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Spirituality in education, as a necessity in improving the quality of teaching and learning, is affected by various personal, social, religious, and cultural factors. Since the identification of these factors can empower the faculties and facilitate the transfer of spiritual concepts through teaching, the aim of this study is explanation of the factors affecting the spirituality transfer in education process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative content analysis approach study included 22 faculty members of medical universities, 25 faculty members of seminary, and 19 medical students interested in participating in the study. They were studied according to purposive sampling method. Data collection was done by interviewing a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis method. RESULTS: The factors influencing the spiritual transfer in teaching process were classified into two main forms of teacher-related factors and peripheral-related factors. Teacher-related factors include the teacher's insight and worldview, adherence to religious principles, belief in ethical virtues, the positive and constructive interaction of the teacher with the student, and the mastery of teaching skills. The peripheral-related factors include the highly skilled classrooms and the talented learners. CONCLUSION: The intensification of the insight, religious worldview and the basic of beliefs, consolidating ethics and empowering faculty members in teaching skills along with building a positive and constructive relationship with the students, as well as institutionalizing spirituality as the inseparable teaching element can facilitate the transfer of spirituality concepts. More studies are needed in this regard.

TI  - Imaging sedimentary basins from high-resolution aeromagnetics and texture analysis
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Image texture is an important property of gridded aeromagnetic data that together with the availability of closer survey line-spacings and more sensitive instrumentation, has become more relevant for qualitative interpretations. Problems arise though when it is used as a basis for geological interpretation, since visual textures are difficult to define. This can introduce bias when interpretations are not validated against repeatable and testable quantitative measures. We propose the use of well-established unsupervised texture segmentation techniques that use multi-scale, orientation-selective Gabor filters to automatically domain contrasting textures in aeromagnetic maps. These methods are applied to tilt-derivative reduced-to-pole magnetics over the Palaeoproterozoic Earaheedy Basin, that was deposited over the northeastern Yilgarn Craton in a marginal setting prior to the ca. 1800 Ma Capricorn Orogeny Western Australia. These results are then validated against a geophysically constrained interpretation of the area and a review of the magnetic characteristics of the region. Our results demonstrate how automatic texture domaining from gridded magnetic-field data can produce geologically feasible results that can be used to constrain the architecture of basins that contain magnetic sedimentary rocks.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Flood Detection under Multiple Modes and Multiple Orbit Conditions: A Case Study in Japan on Typhoon Hagibis, 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood detection using a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become a powerful tool for organizing disaster responses. The detection accuracy is increased by accumulating pre-event observations, whereas applying multiple observation modes results in an inadequate number of observations with the same mode from the same orbit. Recent flood detection studies take advantage of the large number of pre-event observations taken from an identical orbit and observation mode. On the other hand, those studies do not take account of the use of multiple orbits and modes. In this study, we examined how the analysis results suffered when pre-event observations were only taken from a different orbit or mode to that of the post-event observation. Experimental results showed that inundation areas were overlooked under such non-ideal conditions. On the other hand, the detection accuracy could be recovered by combining analysis results from possible alternate datasets and became compatible with ideal cases.

AB  - According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global mean sea levels may rise from 0.43 m to 0.84 m by the end of the 21st century. This poses a significant threat to coastal cities around the world. The shoreline of Karachi (a coastal mega city located in Southern Pakistan) is vulnerable mainly due to anthropogenic activities near the coast. Therefore, the present study investigates rates and susceptibility to shoreline change using a 76-year multi-temporal dataset (1942 to 2018) through the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Historical shoreline positions were extracted from the topographic sheets (1:250,000) of 1942 and 1966, the medium spatial resolution (30 m) multi-sensor Landsat images of 1976, 1990, 2002, 2011, and a high spatial resolution (3 m) Planet Scope image from 2018, along the 100 km coast of Karachi. The shoreline was divided into two zones, namely eastern (25 km) and western (29 km) zones, to track changes in development, movement, and dynamics of the shoreline position. The analysis revealed that 95% of transects drawn for the eastern zone underwent accretion (i.e., land reclamation) with a mean rate of 14 m/year indicating that the eastern zone faced rapid shoreline progression, with the highest rates due to the development of coastal areas for urban settlement. Similarly, 74% of transects drawn for the western zone experienced erosion (i.e., land loss) with a mean rate of -1.15 m/year indicating the weathering and erosion of rocky and sandy beaches by marine erosion. Among the 25 km length of the eastern zone, 94% (23.5 km) of the shoreline was found to be highly vulnerable, while the western zone showed much more stable conditions due to anthropogenic inactivity. Seasonal hydrodynamic analysis revealed approximately a 3% increase in the average wave height during the summer monsoon season and a 1% increase for the winter monsoon season during the post-land reclamation era. Coastal protection and management along the Sindh coastal zone should be adopted to defend against natural wave erosion and the government must take measures to stop illegal sea encroachments.

TI  - The Religion-Environment (Climate Change) Connection <i>Evidence from Nigeria</i>
T2  - WORLDVIEWS-GLOBAL RELIGIONS CULTURE AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following Lynn White's thesis of 1967 which indicted some Christian values for the current ecological crisis, many studies have been conducted on the connection between religion and environment/ecological crisis. These studies have sought to know whether religious beliefs and values influence environmental/climate change perceptions of people. However, while these studies have been geographically biased, their results have remained inconclusive. This study therefore examined this age-long debate with evidence from Nigeria. The study involved 30 church leaders drawn from Catholic, Anglican and Pentecostal churches in five geographical zones in Nigeria. The data was analyzed using descriptive analytical method. Findings show that religious values/schemas in forms of Eschatological/End-Time beliefs, Dominion beliefs, Theological fatalism, Pessimism etc. influenced climate change perceptions among the church leaders. The study also found that religious affiliation and theology mattered with respect to the influence of some religious beliefs. The implications of findings for the research on religion-environmental/climate change connection are discussed.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Value Distribution Along the Agroecological Gradient in North-Central Ethiopia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and the associated ecosystem service functions vary with changes in agroecological conditions. This study analyzed the distribution of ecosystem service values along the agroecological gradient in Borena landscape. Land-cover information was extracted from Landsat satellite images; and ecosystem service values were estimated using established global and local databases. Land-cover types were constrained in one or two agroecological zones with varying proportions. Cultivated land covering 53.7% of the total landscape area, plantation forest (32.3%) and grassland (9.4%) land-cover types exist in all agroecological zones, with the highest proportion in the humid highland. The highest long-term average ecosystem service value was observed along the humid highland accounting for about 21.8-33.11 million $US. The sub-humid highland consisted 5.67-8.88 million $US. Ecosystem service value showed a decreasing trend between 1973 and 2001 along all agroecological zones and increased in 2016. Moreover, the highest depletion was found along the humid highland (7.27-18.93 million $US) and least depletion was observed along the cold highland (1.79-4.40). Occurrence of the highest depletion along the most inhabited zone, i.e., humid highland, revealed that many of the impacts are human induced. Agroecological gradient substantially determines the amount and distribution of ecosystem service values. Sustainable land management efforts and proper land-use planning are required with special attention to susceptible zones to conserve and increase ecosystem service values.

TI  - Effects of prediction accuracy of the proportion of vegetation cover on land surface emissivity and temperature using the NDVI threshold method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting land surface energy budgets requires precise information of land surface emissivity (LSE) and land surface temperature (LST). LST is one of the essential climate variables as well as an important parameter in the physics of land surface processes at local and global scales, while LSE is an indicator of the material composition. Despite the fact that there are numerous publications on methods and algorithms for computing LST and LSE using remotely sensed data, accurate prediction of these variables is still a challenging task. Among the existing approaches for calculating LSE and LST, particular attention has been paid to the normalised difference vegetation index threshold method (NDVITHM), especially for agriculture and forest ecosystems. To apply NDVITHM, knowledge of the proportion of vegetation cover (P-V) is essential. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the prediction accuracy of the P-V on the estimation of LSE and LST when using NDVITHM. In August 2015, a field campaign was carried out in mixed temperate forest of the Bavarian Forest National Park, in southeastern Germany, coinciding with a Landsat-8 overpass. The P-V was measured in the field for 37 plots. Four different vegetation indices, as well as artificial neural network approaches, were used to estimate P-V and to compute LSE and LST. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of P-V improved using an artificial neural network (R-CV(2) = 0.64, RMSECV = 0.05) over classic vegetation indices (R-CV(2) = 0.42, RMSECV = 0.06). The results of this study also revealed that variation in the accuracy of the estimated P-V affected calculation results of the LSE. In addition, our findings revealed that, though LST depends on LSE, other parameters should also be taken into account when predicting LST, as more accurate LSE results did not increase the prediction accuracy of LST.

TI  - Targeting Mitochondrial Apoptosis to Overcome Treatment Resistance in Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Deregulated cellular apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and chemotherapy resistance. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family members are sentinel molecules that regulate the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery and arbitrate cell fate through a delicate balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. The recognition of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene as an oncogenic driver in hematological malignancies has directed attention toward unraveling the biological significance of each of the BCL-2 superfamily members in cancer progression and garnered interest in the targeting of apoptosis in cancer therapy. Accordingly, the approval of venetoclax (ABT-199), a small molecule BCL-2 inhibitor, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia has become the proverbial torchbearer for novel candidate drug approaches selectively targeting the BCL-2 superfamily. Despite the inspiring advances in this field, much remains to be learned regarding the optimal therapeutic context for BCL-2 targeting. Functional assays, such as through BH3 profiling, may facilitate prediction of treatment response, development of drug resistance and shed light on rational combinations of BCL-2 inhibitors with other branches of cancer therapy. This review summarizes the pathological roles of the BCL-2 family members in cancer, discusses the current landscape of their targeting in clinical practice, and highlights the potential for future therapeutic inroads in this important area.

TI  - Characterizing land cover/land use from multiple years of Landsat and MODIS time series: A novel approach using land surface phenology modeling and random forest classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 20 years, substantial amounts of grassland have been converted to other land uses in the Northern Great Plains. Most of land cover/land use (LCLU) assessments in this region have been based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Cropland Data Layer (USDA - CDL), which may be inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate an approach to map land cover utilizing multi-temporal Earth Observation data from Landsat and MODIS. We first built an annual time series of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from MODIS 8-day composites of land surface temperatures. Using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat Collection 1's surface reflectance, we then fit at each pixel a downward convex quadratic model to each year's progression of AGDD (i.e., EVI = alpha + beta x AGDD - gamma x AGDD(2)). Phenological metrics derived from fitted model and the goodness of fit then are submitted to a random forest classifier (RFC) to characterize LCLU for four sample counties in South Dakota in three years (2006, 2012, 2014) when reference point datasets are available for training and validation. To examine the sensitivity of the RFC to sample size and design, we performed classifications under different sample selection scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method accurately mapped major crops in the study area but showed limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. Although all RFC models exhibit high accuracy, estimated land cover areas from alternative models could vary widely, suggesting the need for a careful examination of model stability in any future land cover supervised classification study. Among all sampling designs, the "same distribution" models (proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population) tend to yield best land cover prediction. RFC used only the most eight important variables (e.g., three fitted parameter coefficients [alpha, beta, and gamma]; maximum modeled EVI; AGDD at maximum modeled EVI; the number of observations used to fit CxQ model; and the number of valid observations) have slightly higher accuracy compared to those using all variables. By summarizing annual image time series through land surface phenology modeling, LCLU classification can embrace both seasonality and interannual variability, thereby increasing the accuracy of LCLU change detection.

TI  - Shifts in the Molecular Epidemiology of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> Infections in a Sentinel Region of New Zealand following Implementation of Food Safety Interventions by the Poultry Industry
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2006, New Zealand had the highest notification rate of campylobacteriosis in the world, and poultry was considered the leading source of campylobacteriosis. Implementation of food safety interventions by the poultry industry led to a decrease in the campylobacteriosis notification rate. The aim is to examine the impact of targeted food safety interventions implemented by the New Zealand poultry industry on the source attribution of Campylobacter jejuni infections in a sentinel region. Campylobacter jejuni isolates collected from the Manawatu region of New Zealand between 2005 and 2007 ("before intervention") and 2008 and 2015 ("after intervention") from human clinical cases, chicken meat, ruminant feces, environmental water, and wild bird sources were subtyped by multilocus sequence typing. Viable counts of Campylobacter spp. from carcasses were analyzed using a zero-inflated Poisson regression model. In the period before intervention, sequence type 474 (ST-474) was the most common sequence type (ST) recovered from human cases, accounting for 28.2% of the isolates. After intervention, the proportion of human cases positive for ST-474 reduced to 9.3%. Modeling indicated that chicken meat, primarily from one supplier, was the main source of C. jejuni infection in the Manawatu region before intervention. However, after intervention poultry collectively had a similar attribution to ruminants, but more human cases were attributed to ruminants than any single chicken supplier. Viable counts on carcasses were lower in all poultry suppliers after intervention. This study provides evidence of changes in the source attribution of campylobacteriosis following targeted food safety interventions in one sector of the food supply chain.IMPORTANCE This study provides a unique insight into the effects of food safety interventions implemented in one sector of the food industry on the transmission routes of a major foodborne agent. Following the implementation of food safety interventions by the poultry industry, shifts in the molecular epidemiology of Campylobacter jejuni infections in a sentinel region of New Zealand were observed. Targeted interventions to reduce disease incidence are effective but require continued surveillance and analysis to indicate where further interventions may be beneficial.

TI  - The state of truth in the context of globalization
T2  - EKONOMIA I PRAWO-ECONOMICS AND LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivation: This article addresses the issue of the functioning of modern societies in the context of worldview transformations related to globalization processes. Whether today's globalization processes - the dissemination of specific models, designs, systems, tools and narrations in socio-cultural-economic-political dimensions - have significantly redefined the notion of truth and strengthened (or perhaps weakened) its validity (phenomenon)? The main motivation to undertake this research was the desire to show the role and the strengthening of value (truth) in social practice, in particular in relation to scientific and economic practice.Aim: The purpose of the article is to answer the question how globalization (in the socio-economic-cultural aspect) affects new ways of redefining the truth, treated as the axiological basis of scientific practice. The economic aspect has been taken into account in particular in the context of the establishment of a new (technological) approach to truth based on globalization processes taking place within the framework of network economics and on-demand economy. The literature review reconstructs two historically significant ways of redefining truth as the base value for scientific practice (autotelic and socio-useful) in order to show the breadth of socio-economic changes associated with the new definition of truth (as a technological value). The article is theoretical, based on philosophical considerations, recognized in a cultural perspective; the humanistic interpretation was applied.Results: The result of the research is to show: 1. the continuity of the process of redefining the truth, 2. the need to take into account the axiological context in relation to new types of economic practice.

TI  - Wildfire Smoke Particle Properties and Evolution, from Space-Based Multi-Angle Imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emitted smoke composition is determined by properties of the biomass burning source and ambient ecosystem. However, conditions that mediate the partitioning of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) formation, as well as the spatial and temporal factors that drive particle evolution, are not understood adequately for many climate and air-quality related modeling applications. In situ observations provide considerable detail about aerosol microphysical and chemical properties, although sampling is extremely limited. Satellites offer the frequent global coverage that would allow for statistical characterization of emitted and evolved smoke, but generally lack microphysical detail. However, once properly validated, data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System's Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument can create at least a partial picture of smoke particle properties and plume evolution. We use in situ data from the Department of Energy's Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) field campaign to assess the strengths and limitations of smoke particle retrieval results from the MISR Research Aerosol (RA) retrieval algorithm. We then use MISR to characterize wildfire smoke particle properties and to identify the relevant aging factors in several cases, to the extent possible. The RA successfully maps qualitative changes in effective particle size, light absorption, and its spectral dependence, when compared to in situ observations. By observing the entire plume uniformly, the satellite data can be interpreted in terms of smoke plume evolution, including size-selective deposition, new-particle formation, and locations within the plume where BC or BrC dominates.

TI  - Mapping Forest Disturbances between 1987-2016 Using All Available Time Series Landsat TM/ETM plus Imagery: Developing a Reliable Methodology for Georgia, United States
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest resources have a high economic value in the State of Georgia (USA) and the landscape is frequently disturbed as a part of forest management activities, such as plantation forest management activities. Thus, tracking the stand-clearing disturbance history in a spatially referenced manner might be pivotal in discussions of forest resource sustainability within the State. The two major objectives of this research are (i) to develop and test a reliable methodology for statewide tracking of forest disturbances in Georgia, (ii) to consider and discuss the use and implications of the information derived from the forest disturbance map. Two primary disturbance detection methods, a threshold algorithm and a statistical boundary method, were combined to develop a robust estimation of recent forest disturbance history. The developed model was used to create a forest disturbance record for the years 1987-2016, through the use of all available Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data. The final product was a raster database, where each pixel was assigned a value corresponding to the last disturbance year. The overall accuracy of the forest disturbance map was 87%, and it indicated that 4,503,253 ha, equivalent to 29.2% of the total land area in Georgia, experienced disturbances between 1987 and 2016. The estimated disturbed area in each year was highly variable and ranged between 84,651 ha (+/- 36,354 ha) to 211,780 ha (+/- 49,504 ha). By combining the use of the disturbance map along with the 2016 database from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), we also analyzed the regional variation in the disturbance history. This analysis indicated that disturbed forests in urban areas were more likely to be converted to other land-uses. The forest disturbance record created in this research provides the necessary spatial data and address forest resource sustainability in Georgia. Additionally, the methodology used has application in the analysis of other resources, such as the estimation of the aboveground forest biomass.

TI  - Inter-local climate zone di fferentiation of land surface temperatures for Management of Urban Heat in Nairobi City, Kenya
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid Urbanisation often leads to the formation of Urban Heat Island (UHI), which is believed to link to the characteristics of a city. Proper management of UHI, would, therefore, require recognition of the possible range of heat load increase. This paper presents results of inter-local climate zone (LCZ) differentiation of land surface temperature (LST) for the management of urban hotspots in Nairobi city. WUDAPT methodology and LST_Landsat_8_split_window toolbox were used to generate LCZ and LST maps, respectively. Nairobi LCZs had a unique thermal climate that showed statistically significant differences (< 0.05) in mean LSTs among typical LCZs. LST patterns exhibited sensitivity to building densities and heights, land cover types and surface wetness. Dry and Natural zones were more thermally responsive than wet and built-up zones. However, build-up LCZs with heavy industry, compact buildings, lightweight lowrise (slums) and large lowrise buildings were characterised with warmer LSTs while natural LCZs with water bodies, dense trees and sparsely built classes were associated with slightly lower LSTs. The findings further demonstrate and support the use of LCZs for the delimitation and investigation of the influence of complex urban morphology on local climate formation in an equatorial city like Nairobi.

TI  - Correlation Between the Inframammary Fold and Sixth Rib: Application to Breast Reconstruction
T2  - CLINICAL ANATOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inframammary fold (IMF) is an essential aesthetic element that influences the outcome of breast surgery. In this study, we introduced a new method for finding the IMF based on retrospective analysis of chest computed tomography (CT) scans of women's breasts. Sagittal sections of 80 female chest CTs were analyzed. Sagittal sections of 80 female chest CTs were analyzed by a single plastic surgeon. The distances between the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs and the IMF were measured using Photoshop, and the location of the IMF was statistically analyzed according to age and height using paired t tests and Pearson's correlation test. As determined by our new method, the average distance between the IMF and the sixth rib was 5.33 mm, which was less than that between the IMF and any other rib. The IMF was closest to the sixth rib in all age groups (P < 0.001), and all IMFs were located between 39.5 mm superior and 24 mm inferior to the sixth rib. The sixth rib, one of the most visible reference structures in women's surface anatomy, is the "sentinel rib" for the IMF and the most predictive indicator of the location of the IMF. Knowing the original anatomic location of the IMF will enable better outcomes during breast surgery. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characterisation of droughts using selected indices in Upper Tana River watershed, Kenya
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and assessment of drought is key to modelling, impact assessment, mitigation and prediction of occurrence. The Upper Tana River watershed hosts two of Kenya's main water towers, Mt. Kenya and Aberdare Ranges, and is increasingly under threat from reduced water levels in the river basins due to unsustainable anthropogenic activities. The occurrence of drought in the region often exacerbates the impact of such activities on the natural resource-base. The study evaluated temporal and spatial characteristics of meteorological drought in Upper Tana Watershed using remotely sensed data from 1981 to 2018. Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Modern-Era Retro-Analysis for Research and Applications-Assimilation Model (MERRA) products provided precipitation and temperature data via Google Earth Engine platform. GeoClim was used in the retrieval of Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), while Standardised Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data were downloaded from SPEI Global Drought Monitor. Values for these datasets were plotted against time to facilitate temporal analysis of the drought. Spatially, the most intense meteorological drought period was from 2007 to 2009 in that the years were hit by severe drought for three consecutive years that covered the entire watershed. Temporally, drought incidences were observed in 1982, 1989, 1994, 2000, 2006, and 2011 and 2017. Both SPI and SPEI indices showed similar drought years. Drought mitigation measures should be implemented across the watershed. The findings provide insights that can be used by natural resource management practitioners in; drought forecasting, early warning systems, and in planning and management of water resources within the watershed. We recommend characterisation of the other types of droughts, agricultural and socio-economic droughts, for a holistic understanding of their spatial-temporal manifestations and the impact on the livelihoods of the watershed.

TI  - Applications of SAR Interferometric Coherence Time Series: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Geomorphic Transitions in the South-Central Andes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment transport domains in mountain landscapes are characterized by fundamentally different processes and rates depending on several factors, including geology, climate, and biota. Accurately identifying where transitions between transport domains occur is an important step to quantify the past, present, and future contribution of varying erosion and sedimentation processes and enhance our predictive capabilities. We propose a new methodology based on time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric coherence images to map sediment transport regimes across arid and semiarid landscapes. Using 4 years of Sentinel-1 data, we analyze sediment transport regimes for the south-central Andes in northwestern Argentina characterized by steep topographic and climatic gradients. We observe seasonally low coherence during the regional wet season, particularly on hillslopes and in alluvial channels. The spatial distribution of coherence is compared to drainage areas extracted from digital topography to identify two distinct transitions within watersheds: (a) a hillslope-to-fluvial and (b) a fluvial-to-alluvial transition. While transitions within a given basin can be well-constrained, the relative role of each sediment transport domain varies widely over the climatic and topographic gradients. In semiarid regions, we observe larger relative contributions from hillslopes compared to arid regions. Across regional gradients, the range of coherence within basins positively correlates to previously published millennial catchment-wide erosion rates and to topographic metrics used to indicate long-term uplift. Our study suggests that a dense time series of interferometric coherence can be used as a proxy for surface sediment movement and landscape stability in vegetation-free settings at event to decadal timescales.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Response of Vegetation Indices to Rainfall and Temperature in A Semiarid Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, vegetation indices (VIs) were analyzed as indicators of the spatio-temporal variation of vegetation in a semi-arid region. For a better understanding of this dynamic, interactions between vegetation and climate should be studied more widely. To this end, the following methodology was proposed: (1) acquire the NDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI, and NDMI by classification of vegetation and land cover categories in a monthly period from 2014 to 2018; (2) perform a geostatistical analysis of rainfall and temperature; and (3) assess the application of ordinary and uncertainty least squares linear regression models to experimental data from the response of vegetation indices to climatic variables through the BiDASys (bivariate data analysis system) program. The proposed methodology was tested in a semi-arid region of Zacatecas, Mexico. It was found that besides the high values in the indices that indicate good health, the climatic variables that have an impact on the study area should be considered given the close relationship with the vegetation. A better correlation of the NDMI and EVI with rainfall and temperature was found, and similarly, the relationship between VIs and climatic factors showed a general time lag effect. This methodology can be considered in management and conservation plans of natural ecosystems, in the context of climate change and sustainable development policies.

TI  - Axillary intranodal pressure measurement: A complementary technique for detection of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER INVESTIGATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is growing evidence that intranodal pressure (INP) can predict metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The objective of this study was to measure and utilize INP to evaluate the metastatic involvement of axillary SLNs in breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: INP was measured in 73 clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer patients who were candidate for SLN biopsy. Clinical evaluation of the lymph node, coupled with frozen section analysis of the same excised SLN, was conducted. The level of suspicion (LOS) was used to assess the likelihood of metastases in the SLNs by the surgeons. Then, the miniature catheter tip pressure transducer was used to measure INP in the operation room. Finally, excised SLN was sent for permanent pathologic analysis as a gold standard for the evaluation of SLNs metastatic.Results: We identified the statistically significant increase in INP in nodes containing tumor metastasis in comparison with tumor-free SLNs (19.17 +/- 13.63 vs. 8.82 +/- 4.23) (P = 0.003). We considered the cutoff value for INP at 16 mmHg, which resulted in sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 87%. When the combination of INP above 16 mmHg and the LOS were taken into account for determining the likelihood of metastatic involvement of the LNs, the sensitivity and specificity were 87.5% and 91.7%, respectively. Conclusion: Our data suggest that INP measurement has the potential to help surgeons differentiate metastatic and nonmetastatic SLNs in combination with LOS. Meanwhile, it can be used along with frozen analysis to decrease false-negative rate.

TI  - Wind-Driven Coastal Upwelling near Large River Deltas in the Laptev and East-Siberian Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lena, Kolyma, and Indigirka rivers are among the largest rivers that inflow to the Arctic Ocean. Their discharges form a freshened surface water mass over a wide area in the Laptev and East-Siberian seas and govern many local physical, geochemical, and biological processes. In this study we report coastal upwelling events that are regularly manifested on satellite imagery by increased sea surface turbidity and decreased sea surface temperature at certain areas adjacent to the Lena Delta in the Laptev Sea and the Kolyma and Indigirka deltas in the East-Siberian Sea. These events are formed under strong easterly and southeasterly wind forcing and are estimated to occur during up to 10%-30% of ice-free periods at the study region. Coastal upwelling events induce intense mixing of the Lena, Kolyma, and Indigirka plumes with subjacent saline sea. These plumes are significantly transformed and diluted while spreading over the upwelling areas; therefore, their salinity and depths abruptly increase, while stratification abruptly decreases in the vicinity of their sources. This feature strongly affects the structure of the freshened surface layer during ice-free periods and, therefore, influences circulation, ice formation, and many other processes at the Laptev and East-Siberian seas.

TI  - Improved Semantic Segmentation of Water Bodies and Land in SAR Images Using Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEMANTIC COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of computationally efficient and powerful Deep Learning frameworks and high-resolution satellite imagery has created new approach for developing complex applications in the field of remote sensing. The easy access to abundant image data repository made available by different satellites of space agencies such as Copernicus, Landsat, etc. has opened various avenues of research in monitoring the world's oceans, land, rivers, etc. The challenging research problem in this direction is the accurate identification and subsequent segmentation of surface water in images in the microwave spectrum. In the recent years, deep learning methods for semantic segmentation are the preferred choice given its high accuracy and ease of use. One major bottleneck in semantic segmentation pipelines is the manual annotation of data. This paper proposes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on the training data (images and their corresponding labels) to create an enhanced dataset on which the networks can be trained, therefore, reducing human effort of manual labeling. Further, the research also proposes the use of deep-learning approaches such as U-Net and FCN-8 to perform an efficient segmentation of auto annotated, enhanced data of water body and land. The experimental results show that the U-Net model without GAN achieves superior performance on SAR images with pixel accuracy of 0.98 and F1 score of 0.9923. However, when augmented with GANs, the results saw a rise in these metrics with PA of 0.99 and F1 score of 0.9954.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 'observed rice yield (ton acre(-1))' and 'remotely sensed backscatter'are modelled using artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods for East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh in India. The biophysical variables viz. backscatter (bs), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Chlorophyll (chfl), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), leaf area index (LAI), canopy water content (CWC), and fraction of vegetation cover (F-cover) were derived from Scatterometer Satellite-1 (SCATSAT-1), Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 satellite data.lnputs selected are bs, NDVI, chfl, FAPAR, LAI, CWC, and F-cover for rice yield model, whereas NDVI, chfl, FAPAR, LAI, CWC, and F-cover are inputs for backscatter models. The performance of ANN and MLR models was evaluated using three indices such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). The results concluded that the ANN models achieved R-2 of 0.908 and 0.884 which are 42.73% and 28.85% higher than that of the MLR method for rice yield and backscatter, respectively.

TI  - An Evaluation of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) Implementation Focused on Cancer DRGs in Greek Public Hospitals
T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS-OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The main aims of this study were to evaluate the Greek version of the diagnosis-related group reimbursement system (KEN-DRG) and to compare the KEN-DRG prices with the average actual cost of each group of study cases. Along with other aspects, the differences between the KEN-DRG average length of stay (ALOS) and the actual ALOS was evaluated in selected cases. Methods In the first part of this study, the top-down costing approach was selected in order to break down the total operating costs of the hospital, by hospital department. The aim of this stage was identification of the total operating costs and the average cost per patient day for each Internal Medicine Department of the 'Hippokration' General Hospital of Athens during the period 2014-2015. The final cost drivers were identified using the concept of cluster-related incidents in the hospital. In a subsequent stage, the 13 most frequent cancer KEN-DRG prices charged by Internal Medicine Departments were selected as a sample for further data analysis. Results With regard to the costing of the oncological KEN-DRG, the present study illustrates that a majority of the current reimbursement rates for oncological KEN-DRG codes are under-reimbursed, taking into account the actual costs of hospitalization for each group of cases. The results also reveal that the ALOS of the KEN-DRG does not reflect the actual ALOS in the sample of cases examined. In addition, under the scope of this study, two proposed models for the KEN-DRG price recalculation were developed, based on the average estimated cost of hospitalization for the sample incidents, which could improve the existing reimbursement system for Greek hospitals in the medium term. Conclusions The KEN-DRG payment system that was implemented in Greece for the first time in 2012 needs redesigning in terms of the true cost of hospital services and the actual cost of each patient's treatment. With regard to the existing KEN-DRG reimbursement system, the current study suggested the use of a DRG price calculation model that consists of a relative weight factor and a base price, based on a real cost calculation process on an annual basis. Moreover, it should be stressed that the present study, as well as other related studies, make it possible to know the actual cost of hospitalization, and can contribute to the creation of a cost database over time at the level of hospitals or specific clinical departments.

TI  - Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in deep learning (DL) have allowed for the development of more complex and powerful neural architectures. The adoption of deep convolutional-based architectures with residual learning [residual networks (ResNets)] has reached the state-of-the-art performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Traditionally, ResNets have been considered as stacks of discrete layers, where each one obtains a hidden state of the input data. This formulation must deal with very deep networks, which suffer from an important data degradation as they become deeper. Moreover, these complex models exhibit significant requirements in terms of memory due to the amount of parameters that need to be fine tuned. This leads to inadequate generalization and loss of accuracy. In order to address these issues, this article redesigns the ResNet as a continuous-time evolving model, where hidden representations (or states) are obtained with respect to time (understood as the depth of the network) through the evaluation of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is combined with a deep neural architecture. Our experimental results, conducted with four well-known HSI data sets, indicate that redefining deep networks as continuous systems through ODEs offers flexibility when processing and classifying these kinds of remotely sensed data, achieving significant performance even when a very few training samples are available.

TI  - CoDR: Correlation-Based Data Reduction Scheme for Efficient Gathering of Heterogeneous Driving Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A variety of deep learning techniques are actively employed for advanced driver assistance systems, which in turn require gathering lots of heterogeneous driving data, such as traffic conditions, driver behavior, vehicle status and location information. However, these different types of driving data easily become more than tens of GB per day, forming a significant hurdle due to the storage and network cost. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel scheme, called CoDR, which can reduce data volume by considering the correlations among heterogeneous driving data. Among heterogeneous datasets, CoDR first chooses one set as a pivot data. Then, according to the objective of data collection, it identifies data ranges relevant to the objective from the pivot dataset. Finally, it investigates correlations among sets, and reduces data volume by eliminating irrelevant data from not only the pivot set but also other remaining datasets. CoDR gathers four heterogeneous driving datasets: two videos for front view and driver behavior, OBD-II and GPS data. We show that CoDR decreases data volume by up to 91%. We also present diverse analytical results that reveal the correlations among the four datasets, which can be exploited usefully for edge computing to reduce data volume on the spot.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of National Land Cover Database Shrubland Products on the Sagebrush Steppe Fringe
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data products depicting physical and ecological attributes of a landscape are becoming invaluable tools in wildlife and rangeland management. However, if such geospatial tools and data layers are to be used in management, their accuracy and appropriateness for such use needs to be vetted and validated. We assessed accuracy of two National Land Cover Database (NLCD) shrubland products for use in western South Dakota-percent sagebrush and sagebrush height-by comparing them to ground-truthed data. Western South Dakota sagebrush communities are an ecotone between sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and grassland. This ecotone is typified by shorter- and lower-density sagebrush than interior sagebrush steppe ecosystem. This distinction could make it difficult to remotely detect and map sagebrush in this area. We determined NLCD correlations with ground estimates of sagebrush canopy cover (r = 0.17) and sagebrush height (r = 0.40). The NLCD percent sagebrush accurately predicted sagebrush presence similar to 73-76% of the time once resampled to 100-m pixels and 50-m mean values, respectively. Cohen's kappa values were estimated to determine if the ground-truthed and remoted-sensed data were in agreement when determining sagebrush presence. Kappa values were 0.26 +/- 0.06 and 0.28 +/- 0.06 for mean values within 50-m and resampled 100-m pixels, respectively, indicating a "fair" level of agreement between the ground-truthed and remote-sensed data types when determining presence of sagebrush. The NLCD data sufficiently described the presence of sagebrush in South Dakota, which is useful for estimating geographic distributions of sagebrush obligate species, species distribution models in which presence or absence of sagebrush is of interest, or mapping the occurrence of sagebrush in South Dakota. Inaccuracies of the NLCD shrubland products in predicting sagebrush height and sagebrush canopy cover may limit their utility as continuous variables in species distribution models, habitat selection, and suitability models or when assessing rangeland quality in South Dakota.

TI  - Assessment of shifting cultivation fallows in Northeastern India using Landsat imageries
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation (Jhum) has been a threat to the rich biodiversity of Northeastern India (NEI). Here, we applied an integrated spectral enhancement technique to map the shifting cultivation fallow/ current jhum area in NEI for 2014, 2016 and 2018 using Landsat-8 data. The natural vegetation in shifting cultivation fallow land was analyzed through field sampling. Manipur state occupied the highest shifting cultivation fallow area of 1528.5 km(2) (2014), and it was minimum in Tripura state with 178.3 km(2) (2018). The shifting cultivation fallow hotspot map was derived to identify the repetitive patches, in which the state of Arunachal Pradesh topped with 24.9% and Tripura with lowest 3.6%. Field sampling revealed dominance of four invasive species viz., Mikania micrantha, Ageratum houstonianum, Chromolaena odorata and Ageratina adenophora. We provided an insight into shifting cultivation fallow dynamics and vegetation composition in less than 3 year old shifting cultivation fallow lands. The study using remote sensing approach revealed that the fragile ecosystems of NEI are still facing the threat from shifting cultivation, though the trend has started declining. The generated database can be regularly updated in future using recent Sentinel-2 data with higher spatial and temporal resolution that would enhance the quality of land use management plans.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Landslide Numerical Risk Factor Model and Landslide Inventory Prepared Through OBIA in Chenab Valley, Jammu and Kashmir (India)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A landslide is the movement of rock, debris or earth down along the slope under the gravity. It may cause to loss of people's life and their private and public properties. Landslide is a common hazard in steep slope areas, especially during the rainy season. A study of landslide helps urban planners, engineers and local communities to reduce losses caused by existing and future landslides by means of prevention, mitigation and avoidance. Therefore, the prime aim of this paper is to produce acceptable landslide hazard map for Chenab valley, Jammu and Kashmir. Semiautomatic extraction of the landslide is a suitable method that has been used in this paper to extract the location and extent of the landslides. IRS LISS-IV and CartoDEM have been used for object-based image analysis to extract and prepare a landslide inventory map. About 84 landslide potential sites have been identified by the semiautomatic extraction approach. Landslide numerical risk factor model is derived by using thirteen thematic layers with landslide inventory to prepare the landslide hazard map. The result showed that 21% area of the Chenab valley is falling under the very high hazard zone category of the landslide. The final result of the investigation will definitely be useful in the decision-making procedure at the time of emergency and will be used to prepare a preparedness plan for high-risk areas of Chenab valley. The ROC curve method is used for accuracy assessment that signifies the acceptable result for landslide susceptibility zonation of Chenab valley with 0.956 AUC value.

TI  - A 60-year chronology of glacier surges in the central Karakoram from the analysis of satellite image time-series
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers in the Karakoram have recently been studied intensely using satellite data. The related studies investigated a large variety of characteristics (e.g. short and long-term variability in flow velocities, elevation changes and extent) and revealed a behaviour that differs largely from most other regions of the world (e.g. advancing or stable termini and balanced to positive mass budgets over the past decades). In part, this is also due to the high concentration of surge-type glaciers that are particular attractive for remote sensing studies owing to their large short-term changes. Other studies provided a comprehensive overview on the timing of surges in the Karakoram over recent decades. However, limited information is available for the details of the individual surges and what happened before 1989, partly resulting in a wrong understanding of the dynamics. To provide a more extended base of glacier surging in the central Karakoram, this study utilises the abundant declassified satellite images from the Keyhole Mission (Corona and Hexagon) covering the period 1961 to 1980 as well as a historic map from 1937 to decipher the surge history of 27 glaciers since the 1960s and before. The focus is on the detailed description of the pictorial evidence and the conclusions that can be drawn from it. A major outcome of this analysis is that most of the glaciers that have surged recently, have also surged in the 1950 to 1960s as surge cycles are often in the 40 to 60 year range. Combined with further evidence of previous surges, it seems that the so-called 'Karakoram Anomaly' is around since at least 200 years. It is also shown that two glaciers that are listed as surging are only expanding, that flow blocking of tributaries plays an important role for several surges, that surging glaciers are mostly free of debris, and that surges show a great variability in regard to surge durations (from 2 to 50+ years) and surge cycles (from 20 to 80+ years). Despite this variability, the pattern of postsurge down-wasting and disintegration is always similar, allowing to derive the timing of surges beyond the available pictorial evidence and also to distinguish a surge from a usual advance which is otherwise difficult.

TI  - Performance of four state-of-the-art GPP products (VPM, MOD17, BESS and PML) for grasslands in drought years
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) is of significance for understanding the changes of carbon uptake and its responses to extreme climate events like droughts. Emerging new GPP products with higher spatial and temporal resolutions (500-1000 m, 8-day) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Photosynthesis (MOD17), the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) models, provided unprecedented opportunities to understand the spatial and temporal variations of GPP. However, their performances under drought conditions remain obscure. Here we evaluated the performance of these four state-of-the-art GPP products in grasslands, using FLUXNET data as reference. The results showed that all the four models have reasonable accuracies under non-drought years. In drought years, the VPM performed best, followed by the MOD17, PML and BESS, with the RMSEs of 1.67, 1.69, 1.72 and 1.77 gC m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The VPM, BESS and PML overestimated annual GPP by 2%, 13% and 21%, respectively, while MOD17 underestimated annual GPP by 10% in drought years. This varied model performances under drought years could be partially attributed to the differences in quantifying the water stress effects. The water constraint factor in the VPM, which is derived from the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and directly indicates the overall water content of leaf, plant stand and soil background, could better capture the vegetation response to water content variation than that in MOD17, PML and BESS, all of which used an atmospheric moisture related indicator (the Vapor Pressure Deficit for MOD17 and PML, and the relative humidity for BESS). This study suggests that water stress factors, which reflect the physiological and ecological characteristics of vegetation itself (e.g., LSWI) rather than atmospheric moisture (e.g., VPD) or other meteorological surrogates, should be further considered in GPP models when applied in drought conditions

TI  - One-step nucleic acid amplification for detecting lymph node metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 30% of cN0 patients have occult metastasis. LN invasion is a major prognostic factor. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is an option for cN0 neck management. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) used to analyze SLN in breast cancer is also a candidate to get more reliable intraoperative HNSCC lymph node (LN) staging.Objective: To compare OSNA analysis to pathological analysis in cN0 HNSCC.Materials and methods: 157 LN from 26 cN0 HNSCC patients were prospectively analyzed (6.3LN/patient). Exclusion criteria were previous surgery or radiotherapy. Each node was cut into 4 equal pieces alternatively sent to pathological analysis and OSNA technique. IHC CK19 was performed on the primary tumor biopsy and RT-qPCR of CK19, PVA and EPCAM on the LN lysate of discordant cases.Results: OSNA was able to provide intraoperative result in all patients. OSNA detected 21 metastases. There were 139 concordant LN (88.5%). There were 18 initial discordant LN (11.5%), 13 (8.3%) were OSNA positive/pathological analysis negative, 5 (3.2%) were OSNA negative/pathological analysis positive. After elimination of allocation bias, false negative rate was 1.3%, sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 95.6%, PPV and NPV were 75% and 98.5%.Conclusion: Our results suggest that OSNA should be considered to improve SNB analysis both for increasing micro metastasis diagnosis and offer extemporaneous results.

TI  - New Insights in Regional Climate Change: Coupled Land Albedo Change Estimation in Greenland from 1981 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land albedo is an essential variable in land surface energy balance and climate change. Within regional land, albedo has been altered in Greenland as ice melts and runoff increases in response to global warming against the period of the pre-industrial revolution. The assessment of spatiotemporal variation in albedo is a prerequisite for accurate prediction of ice sheet loss and future climate change, as well as crucial prior knowledge for improving current climate models. In our study, we employed the satellite data product from the global land surface satellite (GLASS) project to obtain the spatiotemporal variation of albedo from 1981 to 2017 using the non-parameter-based M-K (Mann-Kendall) method. It was found that the albedo generally showed a decreasing trend in the past 37 years (-0.013 +/- 0.001 decade(-1), p < 0.01); in particular, the albedo showed a significant increasing trend in the middle part of the study area but a decreasing trend in the coastal area. The interannual and seasonal variations of albedo showed strong spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Additionally, based on natural and anthropogenic factors, in order to further reveal the potential effects of spatiotemporal variation of albedo on the regional climate, we coupled climate model data with observed data documented by satellite and adopted a conceptual experiment for detections and attributions analysis. Our results showed that both the greenhouse gas forcing and aerosol forcing induced by anthropogenic activities in the past 37 decades were likely to be the main contributors (46.1%) to the decrease of albedo in Greenland. Here, we indicated that overall, Greenland might exhibit a local warming effect based on our study. Albedo-ice melting feedback is strongly associated with local temperature changes in Greenland. Therefore, this study provides a potential pathway to understanding climate change on a regional scale based on the coupled dataset.

TI  - Quality control and assessment of interpreter consistency of annual land cover reference data in an operational national monitoring program
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (USGS LCMAP) initiative is working toward a comprehensive capability to characterize land cover and land cover change using dense Landsat time series data. A suite of products including annual land cover maps and annual land cover change maps will be produced using the Landsat 4-8 data record. LCMAP products will initially be created for the conterminous United States (CONUS) and then extended to include Alaska and Hawaii. A critical component of LCMAP is the collection of reference data using the TimeSync tool, a web-based interface for manually interpreting and recording land cover from Landsat data supplemented with fine resolution imagery and other ancillary data. These reference data will be used for area estimation and validation of the LCMAP annual land cover products. Nearly 12,000 LCMAP reference sample pixels have been interpreted and a simple random subsample of these pixels has been interpreted independently by a second analyst (hereafter referred to as "duplicate interpretations"). The annual land cover reference class labels for the 1984-2016 monitoring period obtained from these duplicate interpretations are used to address the following questions: 1) How consistent are the reference class labels among interpreters overall and per class? 2) Does consistency vary by geographic region? 3) Does consistency vary as interpreters gain experience over time? 4) Does interpreter consistency change with improving availability and quality of imagery from 1984 to 2016? Overall agreement between interpreters was 88%. Class-specific agreement ranged from 46% for Disturbed to 94% for Water, with more prevalent classes (Tree Cover, Grass/Shrub and Cropland) generally having greater agreement than rare classes (Developed, Barren and Wetland). Agreement between interpreters remained approximately the same over the 12-month period during which these interpretations were completed. Increasing availability of Landsat and Google Earth fine resolution data over the 1984 to 2016 monitoring period coincided with increased interpreter consistency for the post-2000 data record. The reference data interpretation and quality assurance protocols implemented for LCMAP demonstrate the technical and practical feasibility of using the Landsat archive and intensive human interpretation to produce national, annual reference land cover data over a 30-year period. Protocols to estimate and enhance interpreter consistency are critical elements to document and ensure the quality of these reference data.

TI  - Evaluating current satellite capability to observe diurnal change in nitrogen oxides in preparation for geostationary satellite missions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes the degree to which current polar-orbiting satellites can evaluate the daytime change in NO2 vertical column density (VCD) in urban, suburban, and rural areas. We examine these issues by considering the diurnal cycle of NO2 over the United States, using the large NO2 monitoring network supported by states, tribes, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Through this analysis, we identify the potential opportunities and limitations of current space-based NO2 data in capturing diurnal change. Ground-based monitoring data from the US EPA are compared with satellite retrievals of NO2 from the KNMI Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) for two instruments: GOME-2 with a mid-morning overpass, and OMI with an early afternoon overpass. Satellite data show evidence of higher morning NO2 in the vicinity of large urban areas. Both satellites and ground monitors show similar to 1.5-2x greater NO2 abundance between morning and afternoon in urban areas. Despite differences in horizontal resolution and overpass time, the two satellite retrievals show similar agreement with ground-based NO2 measurements. When analyzed on a pixel-by-pixel basis, we find evidence for spatial structure in the diurnal change in NO2 between city center and surrounding areas in Southern California. Wider analysis of urban-suburban structure in diurnal NO2 change is hindered by resolution differences in the two satellite instruments, which have the potential to create data artefacts. This study highlights the value of future geostationary instruments to provide comparable satellite retrievals for NO2 over the course of a day, and research needs related to the effective utilization of NO2 satellite data for air quality applications.

TI  - A method for constructing synthetic parallel tracks for augmenting in-situ data with satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In-situ observations have significant importance for calibration and validation of satellite data, processes studies etc, however in-situ observations are often available with less spatio-temporal coverage due to practical limitations in making observations, as well as cost effectiveness. Albeit satellite observations have better spatial and temporal coverage, they have certain limitations like obstacles of cloud coverage, retrieval algorithms etc. Hence worthy inferences on the processes (that was intended to study) can be obtained only through skillful utilization of both in-situ observations, satellite and/or reanalysis products. We have illustrated a method for deriving synthetic parallel tracks to in-situ track/survey. Using this method, the satellite and/or reanalysis products can be extracted over these synthetic parallel tracks to derive worthy understanding/conclusions on the processes. The points on the original track are reproduced in terms of slope and distance, which can be utilized to construct a new synthetic parallel track initiating at a predetermined distance to the starting point of original track. As an example, we have demonstrated variations in oceanic physical properties along synthetic parallel tracks to the track of the Khai-muk cyclone. It is easy to understood using this technique that the variations in sub-surface heat content (as evidenced by variations in sea level along Khai-muk cyclone track) have a relatively major role in controlling the intensity of the system, compared to the changes in surface temperature. The method illustrated here is applicable to any geophysical track/survey with varying spatial and/or temporal extension.

TI  - FEATURES OF ANIMALISTIC IMAGES' FUNCTIONING IN THE ART OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MODERN PAGAN MOVEMENT
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Present paper is to study the functioning of animalistic images in literary texts by representatives of the modern pagan movement. A relatively recent character of this worldview phenomenon prompt its adherents to generate a new artistic and cultural space, filling it with both traditional images and newly created ones, original not only in terms of neo-paganism, but also for the entire Russian culture. The authors note that the constant structural change of the new language text field leads to the creation of works of different categories: texts revealing the theory of this doctrine, texts-prophecies, as well as - what is of our main interest - literary texts. This paper analyzes traditional Russian folklore animalistic images presented in the abovementioned works of art - images of a crow, a bear, a hare, a wolf. The authors point out that the neopagan epic is characterized by the synthesis of traditional features of folklore texts and "Newspeak", which turns all created texts into a special mythopoetic space to contain "'new paganism' writers' own ideas about the traditional narrative structure and poetics of folklore texts. Furthermore, the study attempts to determine the genre orientation of the works of art considered and highlights the features characteristic of the traditional Russian fairy tale, namely: the conventionality of the depicted world, the trickster behavior of the "weak" hero, the method of creating a comic element in the text.

TI  - Eutrophication Monitoring for Lake Pamvotis, Greece, Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing to monitor inland waters and their current state is of high importance, as fresh waters are the habitat of many species of flora and fauna, and are also important for anthropogenic activities. Water quality can be monitored by many parameters, including dissolved suspended matter, phytoplankton, turbidity, and dissolved organic matter, while the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is a representative indicator for detecting phytoplankton and monitoring water quality. The detection of phytoplankton in water layers, through chl-a indicators, is an effective method for displaying eutrophication. Numerous scientific publications and studies have shown that remote sensing data and techniques are capable of monitoring the temporal and spatial distribution and variation of this phenomenon. This study aimed to investigate the eutrophication in Pamvotis Lake, in Ioannina, Greece with the application of chl-a detection algorithms, by using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data for the time period of 2016-2018. The maximum chlorophyll index (MCI) and maximum peak-height (MPH) algorithms have been applied to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data, to detect chl-a and monitor the trophic range of the water body. Both algorithms were correlated and resulted in Pearson's r values up to 0.95. Finally, the chl-a concentration was estimated by applying an empirical equation that correlates the MPH and chl-a concentration developed within previous studies. Those results were further analyzed and interpreted with spatial statistical methods, to understand the spatial distribution pattern of the eutrophication in our study area. Our results demonstrated that Pamvotis Lake is a eutrophic lake, and the highest chl-a concentration was located in the east and south-east of the lake during the study period. Sentinel-2 data can be a useful tool for lake managers, in order to estimate the spatial distribution of the chl-a concentration and identify areas prone to eutrophication, as well as the coastal zones that may influence the lake through water canals.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Methodology for Fire Break Maintenance Operations Detection with Sentinel-2 Imagery and Artificial Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficult job of fighting fires and the nearly impossible task to stop a wildfire without great casualties requires an imperative implementation of proactive strategies. These strategies must decrease the number of fires, the burnt area and create better conditions for the firefighting. In this line of action, the Portuguese Institute of Nature and Forest Conservation defined a fire break network (FBN), which helps controlling wildfires. However, these fire breaks are efficient only if they are correctly maintained, which should be ensured by the local authorities and requires verification from the national authorities. This is a fastidious task since they have a large network of thousands of hectares to monitor over a full year. With the increasing quality and frequency of the Earth Observation Satellite imagery with Sentinel-2 and the definition of the FBN, a semi-automatic remote sensing methodology is proposed in this article for the detection of maintenance operations in a fire break. The proposed methodology is based on a time-series analysis, an object-based classification and a change detection process. The change detection is ensured by an artificial neural network, with reflectance bands and spectral indices as features. Additionally, an analysis of several bands and spectral indices is presented to show the behaviour of the data during a full year and in the presence of a maintenance operation. The proposed methodology achieved a relative error lower than 4% and a recall higher than 75% on the detection of maintenance operations.

AB  - Objective Identifying term infants presenting with early mild neonatal encephalopathy (NE) as candidates for therapeutic hypothermia (TH) remains unclear. Study objectives were to characterize the neonatal clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and longer-term outcome in infants with mild NE treated with TH. Study design Retrospective cohort study of infants admitted with mild or moderate NE treated with TH. Enrollment criteria included a sentinel event, severe acidosis, DR interventions, and low Apgar scores. Results Infants with mild (n = 11) and moderate NE (n = 37) received TH. Mild NE findings included hyperalertness (64%), hypotonia (73%), high level sensory response (91%); 64% progressed to moderate NE. Infants with mild vs. moderate NE had less severe MRI changes (0 vs. 16%) and no cerebral palsy (CP) (0 vs. 13%). Conclusions Outcomes were favorable with mild NE whereas four infants with moderate NE developed CP. A potential role for TH in this population requires further study.

TI  - Estimation of leaf area index of <i>Pinus taeda</i> L. and <i>Cupressus lusitanica</i> Mill. by vegetation indices
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to quantify the leaf area index (LAI) of a forest of Pinus taeda L. and Cupressus lusitanica Mill. using optical data from the Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI sensors. For that, 50 circular plots of 500m(2) in the area were allocated, in which LAI readings were performed using the LAI-2200 equipment. The remotely located data comprised images of the Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI orbital sensors. After digital processing, 15 vegetation indexes were calculated for each image used. These data were correlated with LAI by plot. With the best indexes correlated with the LAI variable, regression models were constructed using the Stepwise technique (Backward and Forward). The best model was determined based on the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2 adjusted), standard error of estimate (Syx%), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results showed that there was a significant correlation among the average rates per plot and the LAI per plot. The fitted models developed with the indexes derived from Sentinel-2 had superior performance to the models built with the Landsat-8 data. The best estimate was the LAI per plot with 4.75% of error and adjusted R-2 of 0.9134. There was no significant difference between the LAI obtained from the field campaign and the LAI estimated by the spectral data (Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI). However, it is recommended to test this methodology using sensors of high spatial resolution and with other species of the genera Pinus and Cupressus.

M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution and dynamics of subrelativistic electron fluxes (from tens to hundreds of keV) were studied in a space experiment onboard the Vernov satellite. A joint analysis of the experimental data from the Vernov and POES satellites was carried out. Maps of the global distribution of electron fluxes with energies from hundreds keV to MeV in the near-Earth space were obtained, as well as their distribution over drift shells, local time, and geomagnetic longitude. It is shown that significant electron fluxes of subrelativistic energies exist in drift shells with a McIlwain parameter of L < 1.5. The measured longitudinal distribution of electron fluxes in these drift shells indicates that the observed fluxes are "tied" to the shells, and the inhomogeneities of the longitudinal distribution are caused by the features of the configuration of the magnetic field in the satellite orbits.

TI  - Experimental Investigation of Cutting Forces in High-Feed Milling of Titanium Alloy
T2  - ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Titanium super alloys are often used in the chemical and aerospace industries, especially because of financial savings. resulting primarily from cheaper operation of equipment. Machinability of titanium alloys is more difficult than that of other metals. In addition, the low thermal conductivity causes the alloy to stick to the cuffing edge of the cutting tool, thereby causing it to become dull faster. The article deals with the experimental evaluation of cutting forces and the design of suitable cutting parameters for the machining of the UNS R56260 titanium alloy with high-feed milling technology. Testing was carried out in climb and conventional milling under different cutting conditions. The cutting components of forces Fx, Fy, Fz were measured and evaluated. The results of the measurements were processed into a graphical form and suitable cutting conditions were designed in terms of the acting cutting forces.

TI  - Adoption of Exhaust Air Dust Testing in SPF Rodent Facilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable detection of unwanted microbial agents is essential for meaningful health monitoring in laboratory animal facilities. Most rodents at our institution are housed in IVC rack systems to minimize aerogenic transmission of infectious agents between cages. The most commonly used rodent health monitoring systems expose live sentinel rodents to soiled bedding collected from other rodent cages on IVC racks and subsequently test these soiled-bedding sentinels for evidence of infection with excluded agents. However, infectious agents might go undetected when using this health surveillance method, due to inefficient organism shedding or transmission failure. In 2016, our institution switched the health monitoring methodology for the majority of our SPF rodent colonies to real-time PCR testing of environmental samples collected from the exhaust plenums of IVC racks. Here we describe our rationale for this conversion, describe some interesting health monitoring cases that arose soon after the conversion, and discuss a potential problem with the conversion-residual nucleic acids. We compared cost and implementation effort associated with 2 sampling methods, sticky swabs and in-line collection media. We also compared the ability of these 2 sampling methods to detect 2 prevalent microbes in our facilities, Helicobacter and murine norovirus. Our institution-wide switch to health monitoring by real-time PCR assay of exhaust air dust samples thus far has provided a sensitive, simple, and reliable approach for maintenance of SPF conditions in laboratory rodents and has dramatically reduced the use of live sentinel animals.

TI  - Educational Program for Physiologic Monitor Use and Alarm Systems Safety A Toolkit
T2  - CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical alarm systems safety is a national healthcare concern in the United States. Physiologic monitors are the medical devices associated with the highest number of false and clinically insignificant alarms, producing alarm fatigue and a challenge to meet the national clinical alarm systems safety goal. Modern physiologic monitors are high-tech complex devices with multimeasurement modalities and high sensitivity for alarms. This complexity hinders safe operation of the monitors by nurses and appropriate management of associated alarms. Nurses need to integrate cognitive knowledge, psychomotor skills, and critical thinking to safely operate the monitors and support clinical decisions. Limited resources are available to support clinical education for nurses on physiologic monitor use and alarm management. This toolkit presents an educational framework for physiologic monitor use and alarm safety guided by adult learning principles. The components of the program are (1) knowledge, skills, and attitude of physiologic monitor use; (2) scenario-based learning model to support the knowledge, skills, and attitude necessary for safe monitor use; and (3) a framework for evaluating the educational program. Education should be ongoing and customized per facility to ensure safe use of complex technology and to decrease alarm fatigue, the leading cause of alarm-related sentinel events.

TI  - Features of the Variability of the Bioluminescence Intensity of the Plankton Community in the Nearshore Zone of the Black Sea in the Spring and Autumn Periods
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The causes and features of the variability of the bioluminescence intensity of the plankton community in the spring and autumn periods along the coast of Crimea are analyzed based on expedition and satellite data. It is noted that synoptic and mesoscale vortex processes exert a significant impact on the vertical profile of the bioluminescence intensity in hydrobionts and must be taken into account in the analysis of the seasonal variability of bioluminescence parameters. The concept of integral hydrobiont bioluminescence intensity (IHBI) is introduced; it allows one to estimate the total biomass of hydrobionts inhabiting the depth range under consideration. It is found that the average IHBI in the northern part of the Black Sea in the autumn period is higher than in spring by more than ten times. It is noted that mesoscale vortex formations exert the greatest effect on the IHBI in the region of the continental slope.

TI  - INTEGRATION OF OLD BELIEVERS' CULTURE INTO SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SPACE OF A REGION BY MEANS OF MUSEUM WORK
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The modern cultural world of West Siberia includes various cultural organisms rose from ethnic and religious communities. One of the most complicated cultural phenomenon is Old Belief that had influence on development of economic, educational, and cultural life in the region.There are appeared a lot of myths about Old Believers after centuries-long Russian Church dissent that do not let us to get a real assessment of their contribution to conservation and popularization of the true Russian culture and traditions. Members of this confessional group set themselves up as a spiritual movement that integrates their culture into the today's society.The goal of involving concepts of history, culture, traditions of various communities into a public consciousness is successfully achieved by a museum which is an institute of social memory that records and passes not only tangible heritage but also intangible heritage, such as accepted rules and values of a culture. Namely a museum as a unique educational form of culture that visualizes images by means of expositional work creates a museum model of reality. Having a stock of genuine items, documents, materials, a museum uses their informational potential to integrate cultural heritage into society's consciousness, and that helps to bring up an audience's worldview. Popularization of historical and cultural heritage through museum work faces a set of barriers, such as a lack of museum audience's experience of social communication that is sufficient for right perception of life models of the past; typecast thinking; falsification of historical facts, etc.The museums of the Russian Orthodox Church as well as secular museums present the regional history and culture for the local communities; they collected a lot of items and materials related with Old Believers' religious tradition, but in spite of it Old Believers' history and culture is not a subject of museum communication, or work on public representation of Old Believers' heritage manages by those who are not belong to this confessional group.Museum network of West Siberia had included several museums focused on representation of Old Belief's cultural world in the second decade of the 21st century, among them: Museum of Siberian Old Belief's History (Novosibirsk, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia), Museum and Estate of Old Belief's Culture "Prichumyshe" (Zalesovo village, Altai Krai, Russia). Work with the museum audience in these historical and day-to-day life museums engages by force of Old Believers themselves, and they are ready to tell visitors about values and senses of their own cultural world.Methods and technologies of representation in museum work helps to create a peculiar cultural and educational environment that lets to a visitor to plunge into emotional and aesthetic atmosphere and cultural environment of Old Belief. So, museum work is an effective mean for integration of Old Believers' culture into social and cultural space of a region.

TI  - Changes in Vegetation Cover of Yukon River Drainages in Interior Alaska: Estimated from MODIS Greenness Trends, 2000 to 2018
T2  - NORTHWEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends and transitions in the growing season MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series at 250-m resolution were analyzed for the period from 2000 to 2018 to understand recent patterns of vegetation change in ecosystems of the Yukon River basin in interior Alaska. Statistical analysis of changes in the NDVI time series was conducted using the "Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend" method (BEAST). This structural change analysis indicated that NDVI breakpoints and negative 18-yr trends in vegetation greenness over the years since 2000 could be explained in large part by the impacts of severe wildfires, commonly affecting shrubland and forested ecosystems at relatively low elevations (< 300 m). At least one NDVI breakpoint was detected at 29% of the MODIS pixels within the Yukon River basin study area. The wannest and wettest years in the study time period were found to be associated with a sizeable fraction (30%) of NDVI breakpoints. Among pixels with no NDVI breakpoints detected, both forest and shrubland trends were strongly skewed toward positive trend values. Results from gradual NDVI trend analysis supported the hypothesis that air temperature warming has enhanced the rates of (unburned) vegetation growth in shrubland and woodlands across interior Alaska over the past two decades.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Backscatter and Coherence for Rainforest Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports recent advancements in the field of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for forest mapping by using interferometric short-time-series. In particular, we first present how the interferometric capabilities of the Sentinel-1 satellites constellation can be exploited for the monthly mapping of the Amazon rainforest. Indeed, the evolution in time of the interferometric coherence can be properly modeled as an exponential decay and the retrieved interferometric parameters can be used, together with the backscatter, as input features to the machine learning Random Forests classifier. Furthermore, we present an analysis on the benefits of the use of textural information, derived from Sentinel-1 backscatter, in order to enhance the classification accuracy. These textures are computed through the Sum And Difference Histograms methodology and the final classification accuracy, resulting by adding them to the aforementioned features, is a thematic map that exceeds an overall agreement of 85%, when validated using the optical external reference Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) map. The experiments presented in the final part of the paper are enriched with a further analysis and discussion on the selected scenes using updated multispectral Sentinel-2 acquisitions.

TI  - The Impact of Urban Renewal on Land Surface Temperature Changes: A Case Study in the Main City of Guangzhou, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve land use efficiency, urban renewal must also consider urban microclimates and heat islands. Existing research has depended on manual interpretation of high-resolution optical satellite imagery to resolve land surface temperature (LST) changes caused by urban renewal; however, the acquired ground time series data tend to be uneven and unique to specific frameworks. The objective of this study was to establish a more general framework to study LST changes caused by urban renewal using multi-source remote sensing data. Specifically, urban renewal areas during 2007-2017 were obtained by integrating Landsat and yearly Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images, and LST was retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared data using the generalized single-channel algorithm. Our results showed that urban renewal land (URL) area accounted for 1.88% of urban land area. Relative LST between URL and general urban land (GUL) of Liwan, Yuexiu, Haizhu, and Tianhe districts dropped by 0.88, 0.42, 0.43, and 0.10 K, respectively, whereas those of Baiyun, Huangpu, Panyu, and Luogang districts presented opposite characteristics, with a rise in the LST of 0.98, 1.03, 1.63, and 2.11 K, respectively. These results are attributable to population density, building density, and landscape pattern changes during the urban renewal process.

TI  - Characterization and functional analysis of a caspase 3 gene: Evidence that <i>Ch</i>Cas 3 participates in the regulation of apoptosis in <i>Crassostrea hongkongensis</i>
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Caspase 3 plays an important role in apoptotic pathways and contributes to maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system in organisms. The structure, functions, and characteristics of caspase 3 have been extensively investigated in many species, but the research is scarce when it comes to bivalves, particularly oysters. In this study, we identified and cloned a previously unknown caspase 3 gene, named ChCas 3, in C. hongkongensis. The full-length cDNA of ChCas 3 was 1562 bp and included a 175 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 141 bp 3'-UTR and a 1245 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a polypeptide of 415 amino adds. Similar to caspase 3 in other species, ChCas 3 has a pro-domain, a conserved cysteine active site, a large p20 subunit and a small p10 subunit. Our findings demonstrated the expression of ChCas 3 in all the eight tissues via tissue-specific expression assays with the highest expression in haemocytes. ChCas 3 was confirmed to be expressed throughout the larval development stages, and fluorescence from pEGFP-N1-ChCas 3 was found to be distributed throughout the entire HEK293T cell. In addition, the relative expression of ChCas 3 significantly enhanced in hemocytes post bacterial stimulation, and overexpression of ChCas 3 led to upregulation of the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B and p53 reporter genes in HEK293T cells, which indicated that it was involved in innate immune responses. Finally, the apoptosis rate of the haemocytes declined considerably compared with that of the control group after the expression of ChCas 3 was successfully silenced by dsRNA, corroborating its sentinel role in apoptosis. This study provides comprehensive underpinning evidences, affirming caspase 3 crucial role against bacterial infection and apoptosis in C. hongkongensis.

TI  - Detecting Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network: First Steps
T2  - CJC OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A recent feasibility assessment of quality indicators for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (NVAF/AFL) identified the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, a national outpatient electronic medical record (EMR) system, as a data source for measurement. As a first step, we adapted and validated an existing EMR case definition.Methods: A diagnosis of NVAF/AFL was defined using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes (427.3) in either the physician billing, encounter diagnosis, or health condition fields. We identified all presumed cases in a single clinical site with the algorithm and selected a random sample of those who were presumed NVAF/AFL negative with the same algorithm. A chart audit diagnosis of "definite" NVAF/AFL was confirmed by electrocardiogram and nonvalvular diagnosis confirmed after echocardiogram, attending physician, or specialist letter review. To demonstrate face validity, clinical characteristics were compared for patients with and without NVAF/AFL.Results: The case definition identified a possible 184 patients with and 184 without NVAF/AFL. The case validation resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 100-100), specificity of 84.3% (95% CI, 78.8-89.9), and positive and negative predictive value of 74.7% (95% CI, 66.4-83.2) and 100% (95% CI 100-100), respectively. Patients with NVAF/AFL were older (63 vs 42 years) and had a higher proportion of cardiovascular comorbidities and relevant medications.Conclusions: We think it is possible that with further validation work, NVAF/AFL can be accurately identified using this large pan-Canadian EMR system and used as a future tool to measure quality of care in the outpatient setting.

TI  - Characterization of short-term salinity fluctuations in the Neretva River Delta situated in the southern Adriatic Croatia using Landsat-5 TM
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated soil and water salinity can lead to increased risk of crop yield and quality reduction as well as land degradation. This is especially emphasised in arid and semi-arid regions with high levels of evaporation and irrigation practice. In this study, we assessed the potential of applying Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) to evaluate low to moderately salt-affected agricultural areas of the Neretva River Delta, situated in the southern Adriatic region of Croatia. Monthly measurements of water electrical conductivity (ECw), sampled from drainage/irrigation canals, were used as in situ salinity indicators. The relationship between agricultural plots reflectance (32 Landsat-5 TM images, distributed over 22 months from May 2009 to October 2011) and water salinity (measured at ten monitoring stations) was analysed using six Landsat-5 TM bands and spectral indices. Correlation analysis, simple (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were implemented to predict ECw values using the satellite data. Very strong correlations were achieved in the spatial domain for August 2009, September 2010 and September and October 2011, while correlations in the temporal domain had relatively lower values. The Landsat-5 TM data managed to explain 43% of ECw variance using the SLR model, and 62% of the variance using the MLR model with three regressors. Landsat-5 TM remotely sensed data, paired with the in situ observations, showed a promising potential in enhancing the quality of environmental monitoring of low to moderately salt-affected agricultural fields in the irrigated deltas.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to identify the patterns and current trends in the formation of human consciousness and environmental human rights in the process of modernizing world civil society in order to form a single international environmental protection system. An important component of the new worldview should also be the noospheric thinking, the main motive of which is the responsible attitude of man towards the future of the planet on the basis of awareness of both the destructive possibilities of modern humanity and the conditionality of its existence for the preservation of a healthy environment. Taking into account the drawbacks of the formation of international law on the basis of exclusively interstate agreements, international law, at the present stage, should actively involve various social groups, social movements, representatives of territorial communities and other subjects of private law relations in making valid decisions, activating their influence on humanization and socialization of activities of the governments, and for states - to develop recommendations for building a new style of relations with their citizens in order to build a single international system of the environment protection.

TI  - HYBRIDITY OF THE WORLDVIEW BASIS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ORDER
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLITICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The internal contradiction of the ideological basis, on which the international law and order is based, and which is formed on a random and mostly intuitive combination of the elements of the new (Kantian) and old (Cartesian) philosophical systems of Modern Age in the social and individual consciousness is studied in the work as a significant reason for the modern activation of manifestations of hybridity. Both systems have their origins in the depths of history, and their elements are embodied, above all, in two alternative models of interpersonal relations, embedded in the constants of human nature: the 'intersubjective' Kantian model is based on the relations of equal subjects, 'subject-object' the Cartesian model recognizes the subjectivity of only one party.The purpose of the research is to substantiate the hypothesis that the prerequisite of the hybridity phenomena is the internal contradiction of the worldview basis of modern international law and order, which is formed by a random combination of the elements of the Kantian and Cartesian systems of philosophy in the individual and social consciousness, and the intensification of their manifestations at the turn of the XX-XXI centuries is a component of the general revision of worldview orientations and established standards of interpersonal relations and the organization of law and order, which, at least during Modern Age, tends to become more active at the turn of the centuries, acting cumulatively as a 'self-fulfilling prophecies'.

TI  - Anthropogenic forcing exacerbating the urban heat islands in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) phenomena is among the major consequences of the alteration of earth's surface due to human activities. The relatively warmer temperatures in urban areas compared to suburban areas (i.e. UHI) has potential health hazards, such as mortality due to high temperatures and heat waves. In addition, UHI situation demands more energy (e.g. fans and air-conditioners) that would trigger greenhouse gas emissions. Studies on UHI intensity help to assess its impact on urban population, city planning, and urban health planning. This is particularly important for a country like India, where 32% people (similar to 7% of total world population), live in urban areas. We conducted a detailed study on surface UHI intensity (SUHII), which is the difference between urban and surrounding rural land surface temperatures, across all seasons in 44 major cities of India, which shows that mean daytime SUHII is positive (up to 2 degrees C) for most cities, as analysed from satellite temperature measurements for the period 2000-2017, in contrast to previous studies. However, although statistically insignificant, most cities show a positive trend in SUHII for monsoon and post-monsoon periods, but negative for winter and summer seasons. The increasing night-time SUHII in all seasons for most cities suggest increasing trend in temperature in cities due to the impact of the rapid urbanisation, and thus, suggesting the influence of anthropogenic forcing on SUHII. This is also supported by the analysis of aerosols, night lights, precipitation and vegetation in the study regions. Therefore, this study shall aid planning and management of urban areas by giving insights about the effects of nature and intensity of development, land cover and land use mix and the structure of cities on SUHII.

TI  - Investigating the leaf area index changes in response to climate change (case study: Kasilian catchment, Iran)
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover plays an important role in the hydrologic cycle of Kasilian catchment in Iran. This study aimed to estimate leaf area index (LAI), as an important vegetation factor in hydrologic loses, in response to climate change in the future period (2020-2039) over Kasilian catchment located in the north of Iran. For this purpose, LAI was simulated by gridded BIOME-BGC in 319 pixels within the case study domain over the study period (2004-2013) for three dominant land covers of the Kasilian catchment including deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), shrubs, and C3 grasses, and BIOME-BGC accuracy has been assessed using MODIS-derived LAI. Then, monthly projections of climate variables obtained from the average of 9 AOGCMs-AR5 in the future period (2020-2039) and annual projection of CO2 level from 2004 to 2039 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios were used to assess the impact of climate change on LAI. Results show that LAI will increase in response to the overall predicted rise in temperature, precipitation, and CO2 level under both scenarios in all pixels. This increase under the RCP8.5 scenario is predicted to be more than RCP2.6 scenario so that the mean LAI in Kasilian catchment will increase by 3.1% and 2.2% under RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios, respectively. In addition, our analysis showed that DBF land cover will be more sensitive to climate change in this catchment.

T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To present our initial experience in the combined procedure of intraoperative detection of axillary positive node marked with I-125 seed (ML) and sentinel node biopsy (SLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), in breast cancer patients.Material and methods: Prospective study, January 2017 - March 2019, 16 breast cancer patients T1-3N1. TNM stage: IIA: 3,IIB: 10, IIIA: 3. Histological type ductal invasive: 14. Molecular subtype: luminal A: 3, luminal B: 9, HER2: 3, basal like: 1.The ML was marked 227 +/- 36 days before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n: 10), or 1-6 days before surgery, on previously identified node by ultrasound visibility marker, hydrogel (n: 3) or three dimensional-3D (n: 3). Axillary lymphadenectomy was undertaken in 10 patients.Results: ML and SLN were identified in the surgery in 93.7% (15/16) of the cases, in 33.3% (5/15) ML was not among SLN, and in only one patient (1/5) was there a discrepancy between the result of ML and SLN (macrometastases vs. negative 0/2). Median number of lymph nodes SLN: 2.2 +/- 0.9 (range 1-3) and AD: 13.5 +/- 5.2 (range 7-23). In all cases, histopathological analysis of ML. I-125 seed and/or marker within, correctly predicted axillary status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In all patients the I-125 radioactive seed was recovered.Conclusions: Placing of I-125 seeds is a feasible technique for intraoperative location of axillary positive node combined with SLN. The histopathological result of ML allows the axillary status to be determined after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (C) 2019 Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

TI  - Developing sustainability indicators - The need for radical transparency
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a strong impetus to adopt sustainability targets and measures across primary industries. Measuring sustainability demands the development of indicators. Conventional approaches to the development of sustainability indicators (SIs) are technocratic, which thwarts the open and critical development of SIs. Specifically, the technocratic approach: precludes debate concerning the implicit values that guide indicator development and selection; fails to recognise areas where SIs cannot be developed for measuring crucial socioecological functions; and reduces complexity and embellishes certainty. To address these shortcomings, we argue that radical transparency is required. This would involve the following actions: making explicit the values and moral imperatives used to determine what is to be sustained and for whom; opening for critical examination the processes and tools used to weigh and prioritize indicators against each other and create aggregate scores; providing information about the types of expertise involved in the development and the limitations of this expertise; and making candid the 'gaps' where it is necessary, but difficult, or even impossible, to develop quantitative SIs; removing bias against, and accepting the use of qualitative approaches where appropriate. Examples of these forms of transparency are provided from the development of an indigenous sustainability indicator suite, though radical transparency is viewed as a universal solution to the problems of the technocratic approach.

TI  - Fusing China GF-5 Hyperspectral Data with GF-1, GF-2 and Sentinel-2A Multispectral Data: Which Methods Should Be Used?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The China GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite sensor, which was launched in 2018, collects hyperspectral data with 330 spectral bands, a 30 m spatial resolution, and 60 km swath width. Its competitive advantages compared to other on-orbit or planned sensors are its number of bands, spectral resolution, and swath width. Unfortunately, its applications may be undermined by its relatively low spatial resolution. Therefore, the data fusion of GF-5 with high spatial resolution multispectral data is required to further enhance its spatial resolution while preserving its spectral fidelity. This paper conducted a comprehensive evaluation study of fusing GF-5 hyperspectral data with three typical multispectral data sources (i.e., GF-1, GF-2 and Sentinel-2A (S2A)), based on quantitative metrics, classification accuracy, and computational efficiency. Datasets on three study areas of China were utilized to design numerous experiments, and the performances of nine state-of-the-art fusion methods were compared. Experimental results show that LANARAS (this method was proposed by lanaras et al.), Adaptive Gram-Schmidt (GSA), and modulation transfer function (MTF)-generalized Laplacian pyramid (GLP) methods are more suitable for fusing GF-5 with GF-1 data, MTF-GLP and GSA methods are recommended for fusing GF-5 with GF-2 data, and GSA and smoothing filtered-based intensity modulation (SFIM) can be used to fuse GF-5 with S2A data.

TI  - Glacier Mass Balance in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains between 2000 and 2017 Retrieved from ZiYuan-3 Stereo Images and the SRTM DEM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change and have an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and food security in many parts of the world. Glaciers are the major water source of rivers and lakes in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains (NM) region, where the glacier area has the second largest extent on the Tibetan Plateau. The potential of the high spatial resolution ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) Three-Line-Array (TLA) stereo images to retrieve glacier mass balance has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we optimized the procedure to extract a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from ZY-3 TLA stereo images and estimated the geodetic mass balance of representative glaciers in the two typical areas of the NM using ZY-3 DEMs and the C-band Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM in three periods, i.e., 2000-2013, 2013-2017 and 2000-2017. The results provide detailed information towards better understanding of glacier change and specifically show that: (1) with our new stereo procedure, ZY-3 TLA data can significantly increase point cloud density and decrease invalid data on the glacier surface map to generate a high resolution (5 m) glacier mass balance map; (2) the glacier mass balance in both the Western Nyainqentanglha Mountains (WNM) and Eastern Nyainqentanglha Mountains (ENM) was negative in 2000-2017, and experienced faster mass loss in recent years (2013-2017) in the WNM. Overall, the glaciers in the western and eastern NM show different change patterns since they are influenced by different climate regimes; the glacier mass balances in WNM was -0.22 +/- 0.23 m w.e. a(-1) and -0.43 +/- 0.06 m w.e. a(-1) in 2000-2013 and 2013-2017, respectively, while in 2000-2017, it was -0.30 +/- 0.19 m w.e. a(-1) in the WNM and -0.56 +/- 0.20 m w.e. a(-1) in the ENM; (3) in the WNM, the glaciers experienced mass loss in 2000-2013 and 2013-2017 in the ablation zone, while in the accumulation zone mass increased in 2000-2013 and a large mass loss occurred in 2013-2017; as regards the ENM, the glacier mass balance was negative in 2000-2017 in both zones; (4) glacier mass balance can be affected by the fractional abundance of debris and glacier slope; (5) the glacier mass balances retrieved by ZY-3 and TanDEM-X data agreed well in the ablation zone, while a large difference occurred in the accumulation zone because of the snow/firn penetration of the X-band SAR signal.

TI  - Sentinel-1 DInSAR for Monitoring Active Landslides in Critical Infrastructures: The Case of the Rules Reservoir (Southern Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides in reservoir contexts are a well-recognised hazard that may lead to dangerous situations regarding infrastructures and people's safety. Satellite-based radar interferometry is proving to be a reliable method to monitor the activity of landslides in such contexts. Here, we present a DInSAR (Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) analysis of Sentinel-1 images that exemplifies the usefulness of the technique to recognize and monitor landslides in the Rules Reservoir (Southern Spain). The integration of DInSAR results with a comprehensive geomorphological study allowed us to understand the typology, evolution and triggering factors of three active landslides: Lorenzo-1, Rules Viaduct and El Arrecife. We could distinguish between rotational and translational landslides and, thus, we evaluated the potential hazards related to these typologies, i.e., retrogression (Lorenzo-1 and Rules Viaduct landslides) or catastrophic slope failure (El Arrecife Landslide), respectively. We also observed how changes in the water level of the reservoir influence the landslide's behaviour. Additionally, we were able to monitor the stability of the Rules Dam as well as detect the deformation of a highway viaduct that crosses a branch of the reservoir. Overall, we consider that other techniques must be applied to continue monitoring the movements, especially in the El Arrecife Landslide, in order to avoid future structural damages and fatalities.

TI  - Does the time interval between sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion lymph node dissection affect outcome in malignant melanoma? A retrospective cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nodal clearance was recommended after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) despite further metastases to the regional lymph node basin being found in only 6-21% in the literature. This retrospective study was conducted to determine the role of the time interval between excision of primary melanoma and confirmed metastasis in the sentinel lymph node biopsy as well as the one between positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB-positive patients) and subsequent completion lymph node dissection (CLND) on the presence of metastases.The monocentric analysis included 121 patients with a history of completion lymph node dissection after positive SLNB from January 2005 to October 2013.Additional metastases in the regional lymph node basin (non-sentinels) were found in 14.05% (n = 17). Significant risk factors for the presence of metastases in CLND were the time between confirmed primary tumour to metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) (p = 0.0034), N-category of TNM-classification (p = 0.0066) and independent of thickness of primary tumour (p = 0.11). If SLNB was performed up to forty-three days after confirmed primary melanoma, subsequent lymph node dissection was positive in less than 9.1%. When SLNB was performed with a delay of more than 80 days, all patients had metastases in the CLND specimens.Our data analysis suggests that delays in subsequent procedures of SLNB after diagnosis of primary melanoma may have a greater impact on positivity of non-sentinel lymph nodes than previously assumed. Our retrospective analysis may indicate the reconsideration of time schedule in the management of primary melanoma to potentially avoid local relapse in the draining lymph node region after positive SLNB.

TI  - Multi-temporal bare surface image associated with transfer functions to support soil classification and mapping in southeastern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed soil maps are essential for agricultural management, but they are scarce in many regions. Even with the recent development of digital soil mapping (DSM) strategies, providing an adequate spatial representation of soils is still a challenging task. Therefore, this work aims to define a DSM approach, which combines proximal and remote sensing data to describe the spatial variation of soil attributes and types. The study was carried out in a site at southeastern Brazil, where 326 sampling points were defined and collected at two depths. Soil Vis-NIR spectra and physico-chemical attributes were measured in laboratory. A bare surface synthetic image (SYSI) was created from multi-temporal Landsat images and later validated with lab. spectra. Geographically weighted regression was used to calibrate depth transfer functions, which were applied to SYSI, generating a subsurface soil synthetic image (SYSIsub). Soil attributes at both depths were mapped with SYSI, SYSIsub and terrain derivatives. A soil classification key was designed following the Brazilian Soil Classification System and boolean logic. Soils were classified based on the soil attributes maps and boolean key. Hence, Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) was performed to evaluate the error propagation from predicted attribute maps to soil types map. Correlations between satellite and lab. spectra varied from 0.68 to 0.8, indicating good capacity of SYSI in retrieving bare soil reflectance. Depth transfer functions also had good performance, with R-2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.72. The soil attribute maps with best performance were clay content (R-2 = 0.63), iron concentration (R-2 = 0.72) and soil color (hue R-2 = 0.57; value R-2 = 0.73; chroma R-2 = 0.63). Soil organic matter and chemical attributes were poorly predicted, with R-2 between 0.12 and 0.38. MCS indicated that uncertainties in attributes maps might result in confusion between Ferralsols and Acrisols, Regosols and Luvisols, as well as Luvisols and Acrisols. Comparison between digital and conventional maps of soil classes, presented satisfactory kappa (34.65%) and global accuracy (54.46%). The technique presents an improvement to DSM, as it integrates soil sensing and depth transfer functions into DSM.

TI  - Determining the Regime Shift of the Baltic Sea Ice Seasons during 1982-2016
T2  - NASE MORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distributions of ice season characteristics in the Baltic Sea during 1982-2016 were studied. A shift in the ice season regime was observed in 2006-2007. Ice season characteristics before and after the shift were determined in the northern and southern regions of the Baltic Sea, and the contributions of these areas to the shift regime were evaluated. To study changes in ice conditions, satellite data on the daily ice concentration over the Baltic Sea provided by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service were used. The ice cover extent and number of ice days were calculated. The maximal ice extent event of the ice season shifted from the beginning of March to the end of January in 2007. The average ice concentration over the Baltic Sea was 18% and 10% before and after the shift, respectively. On average, 32 and 19 ice days occurred before and after the shift, respectively. The average ice concentration in the northern Baltic was 54% before and 34% after the shift, and the concentration in the southern Baltic was 8% before and 7% after the shift. The determined shift of the ice season characteristics indicated that extensive ice cover does not last long during the after-shift seasons.

TI  - A Scan-to-BIM Methodology Applied to Heritage Buildings
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heritage buildings usually have complex (non-parametric) geometries that turn their digitization through conventional methods in inaccurate and time-consuming processes. When it comes to the survey and representation of historical assets, remote sensing technologies have been playing key roles in the last few years: 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry surveys save time in the field, while proving to be extremely accurate at registering non-regular geometries of buildings. However, the efficient transformation of remote-sensing data into as-built parametric smart models is currently an unsolved challenge. A pragmatic and organized Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) methodology is essential in order to obtain a consistent model that can bring benefits and integrate conservation and restoration work. This article addresses the creation of an HBIM model of heritage assets using 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry. Our findings are illustrated in one case study: The Engine House Pacos Reais in Lisbon. The paper first describes how and what measures should be taken to plan a careful scan-to-HBIM process. Second, the description of the remote-sensing survey campaign is conducted accordingly and is aimed at a BIM output, including the process of data alignment, cleaning, and merging. Finally, the HBIM modeling phase is described, based on point cloud data.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations of Secchi Depth and Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient from Sentinel-2 MSI over a Large Reservoir
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alqueva reservoir (South of Portugal) in the Guadiana river basin constitutes the most important water resource in southern Portugal for domestic and agricultural consumption. We present a methodology developed to characterize spatial and temporal variations of Secchi depth and diffuse attenuation coefficient (both related to dissolved/suspended particles and to water transparency), using high spatial resolution satellite images from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). Empirical relations between satellite retrievals of surface reflectances and in situ measurements of water parameters were defined and applied to the entire reservoir for spatial and temporal analysis in the period July 2017-June 2019, useful in the identification of microalgae blooms and rapid variations in water characteristics, which allowed us to differentiate five zones. Water estimates with lower transparency and higher attenuation of radiation were found in the northern area of Alqueva reservoir during the months characterized by higher water temperatures, with Secchi depth monthly averages near 1.0 m and diffuse attenuation coefficient near or above 1.5 m(-1). Satellite retrievals of water with greater transparency in the reservoir were obtained in the southern area in months with low water temperature and atmospheric stability, presenting some monthly Secchi depth averages above 3 m, and diffuse attenuation coefficient below 0.8 m(-1). January 2018 presented great transparency of water with a Secchi depth of 7.5 m for pixels representing the 95th percentile and diffuse attenuation coefficient of 0.36 m for pixels representing the 5th percentile in the Southern region.

TI  - Robust Landsat-based crop time series modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable satellite monitoring of agriculture is often difficult because surface variations occur rapidly compared to the cloud-free satellite observation frequency. Harmonic time series models, i.e., superimposed sequences of sines and cosines, have an established provenance for fitting satellite vegetation index time series to coarse resolution satellite data, but their application to medium resolution Landsat data for crop monitoring has been limited. Non-linear harmonic models have been shown to perform well over agricultural sites using single-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series, but have not been explored with Landsat data. The 2017 availability of Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over the United States provides the opportunity to investigate the utility of temporally rich Landsat data for 30m pixel-level crop monitoring. In this paper, the capability of 5- and 7-parameter linear harmonic models and a 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model applied to a year of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) ARD is investigated. The analysis is undertaken over six sites, each defined by a 5000x5000 30m pixel ARD tile, that together include the major conterminous United States (CONUS) crops identified by inspection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The model fits are evaluated as the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the fitted and the observed Landsat data. Considering locations with at least 21 annual Landsat observations, the 7-parameter linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.052 to 0.072) and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.054 to 0.074) are shown to be able to fit annual Landsat NDVI time series for most CONUS crops, whereas the 5-parameter linear harmonic model cannot (tile mean crop NDVI RMSD values ranging from 0.072 to 0.099). If there are between 15 and 20 annual Landsat observations, the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic model is recommended for fitting annual NDVI crop time series, and if there are >= 21 observations, then either the 5-parameter non-linear or the 7-parameter linear model can be used. The 7-parameter model had marginally smaller mean NDVI RMSD values but larger standard deviations than the 5-parameter non-linear model, likely due to the relative robustness of the non-linear model to over-fitting and oscillations. None of the models could reliably fit crops with multiple stages, such as alfalfa, that are insufficiently sampled using combined Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ time series. Given the utility of the growing season peak NDVI for crop yield applications, the date and magnitude of the model fitted peak NDVI are compared to quantify model reporting differences. The differences between the 7-parameter linear and the 5-parameter non-linear harmonic models are not large. For each ARD tile, the mean absolute differences in the estimated peak NDVI days varied from < 2 days in the northern ARD tiles, which had short growing seasons and similar crops, to less than a week for the other tiles except for nearly 10 days for the California tile that had longer growing seasons and more diverse crops including crops with multiple stages. The paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research.

TI  - Understanding the remote influences of ocean weather on the episodic pulses of particulate organic carbon flux
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biological carbon pump has been estimated to export similar to 5-15 Gt C yr(-1) into the deep ocean, and forms the principal deep-sea food resource. Irregular, intense pulses of particulate organic carbon (POC) have been found to make up about one-third of the overall POC fluxes at a long-term deep-sea research station influenced by coastal upwelling of the California Current, Station M (34 degrees 50/N, 123 degrees W, 4000 m depth). However, the drivers of these pulses have been challenging to quantify. It has long been recognized that ocean currents can result in particles being advected while sinking to the point of collection by a sediment trap. Thus, a sediment trap time series can incorporate material from a dynamic catchment area, a concept sometimes referred to as a statistical funnel. This concept raises many questions including: what are the day-to-day conditions at the source locations of the sinking POC? And, how might such 'ocean weather' and related ecosystem factors influence the intense variation seen at the seafloor? Here we analyzed three-dimensional ocean currents from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model from 2011 to 2017 to trace the potential source locations of particles sinking at 1000, 100, and 50 m d(-1) from an export depth of 100 m. We then used regionally tailored satellite data products to estimate export flux of POC from these locations. For the 100 m d(-1) speed, the particles had origins of up to similar to 300 km horizontal distance from the sediment trap location, moored at Station M at 3400 m depth., and nearly 1000 km for the 50 m speed. Particle tracking indicated that, there was considerable inter-annual variation in source locations. Particle source locations tended to originate from the east in the summer months, with higher export and POC fluxes. Occasionally these locations were in the vicinity of highly productive ocean features nearer to the coast. We found significant correlations between export flux of organic carbon from the estimated source locations at 100 m depth to trap-estimated POC fluxes at 3400 m depth. These results set the stage for further investigation into sinking speed distributions, conditions at the source locations, and comparisons with mechanistic biogeochemical models and between particle tracking model frameworks.

TI  - Preoperative Axillary Ultrasound versus Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Early Breast Cancer
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: With improved diagnostic means of early breast cancer, the percentage of cases with metastasis in axillary lymph nodes has decreased from 50-75% to 15-30%. Lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy are not treatment procedures, as they aim at axillary nodal staging in breast cancer. Being surgical interventions, they can lead to various complications. Therefore, recently much attention has been paid to the identification of non-invasive methods for axillary nodal staging. In many countries, ultrasound is a first-line method to evaluate axillary lymph node status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of ultrasound in detecting intact axillary lymph nodes and to assess the accuracy of ultrasound in detecting a heavy nodal disease burden. The additional objective was to evaluate patients' and tumor characteristics leading to false-negative results. Materials and Methods: A total of 227 women with newly diagnosed pT1 breast cancer were included to this prospective study conducted at the Breast Surgery Unit, Clinic of Surgery, Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno Klinikos, between May 1, 2016, and May 31, 2018. All patients underwent preoperative axillary ultrasound examination. Ultrasound data were compared with the results of histological examination. The accuracy and true-negative rate of ultrasound were calculated. The reasons of false-negative results were analyzed. Results: Of the 189 patients who had normally appearing axillary lymph nodes on preoperative ultrasound (PAUS-negative), 173 (91.5%) patients were also confirmed to have intact axillary lymph nodes (node-negative) by histological examination after surgery. The accuracy and the negative predictive value of ultrasound examination were 84.1% and 91.5%, respectively. In >= 3 node-positive cases, the accuracy and the negative predictive value increased to 88.7% and 98.3%, respectively. In total, false-negative results were found in 8.5% of the cases (n = 16); in the PAUS-negative group, false-negative results were recorded only in 1.6% of the cases (n = 3). The results of PAUS and pathological examination differed significantly between patients without and with lymphovascular invasion (LV0 vs. LV1, p < 0.001) as well as those showing no human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and patients with weakly or strongly expressed HER2 (HER2(0) vs. HER2(1), p = 0.024). Paired comparisons revealed that the true-negative rate was significantly different between the LV0 and LV1 groups (91% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.05), and the false-negative rate was statistically significant different between the HER2(0) and HER2(1) groups (10.5% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.05). Evaluation of other characteristics showed both the groups to be homogenous. Conclusions: Negative axillary ultrasound excluded axillary metastatic disease in 91.5% of the patients. PAUS had an accuracy of 88.7% in detecting a heavy nodal disease burden. With the absence of lymphovascular invasion (LV0), we can rely on PAUS examination that axillary lymph nodes are intact (PAUS-negative), and this patients' group could avoid sentinel lymph node biopsy. Patients without HER2 expression are at a greater likelihood of false-negative results; therefore, the findings of ultrasound that axillary lymph nodes are intact (PAUS-negative results) should be interpreted with caution.

CP  - Ocean-Society-of-India Conference (OSICON)
CL  - Thiruvananthapuram, INDIA
AB  - The biological and biophysical characteristics of the nearshore and inland (estuarine) water bodies are mainly dependent on their bathymetry which also drives the coastal/estuarine hydrodynamics and other nearshore processes. The study of bathymetry in inland navigational backwaters of the coastal regions gain further importance due to the periodical dredging activities undertaken to maintain the required draft for navigation. The carrying capacity of the lakes gets affected due to sedimentation from the river inflow gradually altering the bathymetry. Conventional bathymetric soundings are highly time consuming and man power intensive which can be successfully augmented and made faster through remote sensing (RS) methods. The RS method can provide better spatial data compared to point-based measurements and also have the advantage of capturing temporal information. The present study explores the feasibility of retrieving bathymetry using satellite based remote sensing techniques for an inland coastal water body, aiming to provide synoptic inexpensive method for estimating and updating bathymetry data making it handy for coastal research and management. The study has been attempted in Vembanad Lake in Kerala, southwest coast of India. The ratio of the blue (450 - 515 nm) to the green (525 - 605 nm) wavelength of the Landsat satellite images as proposed by Stumpf was applied to generate the linear relationship between the reflectance and field measured depth information. The Kochi to Alappuzha National Waterway No. 3 bathymetry chart of the year 2005 is used as the in situ information for generating a site specific linear regression model which yielded a significant correlation coefficient of 0.753 (N = 707). The regression equation has been applied to generate the Satellite optical reflectance derived bathymetry map for the southern part of Vembanad Lake. The bathymetry obtained through this model has been validated with a set of independent depth sounding values (r2 = 0.92; N = 66). By and large the Stumpf model has been found helpful in recreating water depth using multispectral images in clear waters that permit proper light penetration. However, the present study has shown the potential of its application even in the inland water bodies where the light penetration is affected by a high concentration of suspended sediments and floating vegetation (water hyacinth).

TI  - Analysis of the atmospheric dust in Africa: The breathable dust's fine particulate matter PM<sub>2.5</sub> in correlation with carbon monoxide
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dust has direct effects on people's health and climate change; so, this research studied the remotely sensed dust deposition in Africa from 1980 to 2018, and the dust's particulate matter of 2.5 mu m size (or PM2.5), in particular, which pollutes the breathable air. PM2.5 is studied in comparison with multispectral carbon monoxide (CO), an abundant atmospheric air pollutant in central Africa. CO is an atmospheric gaseous pollutant for which the smoke, a gaseous aerosol from incomplete combustion processes, is the biggest source. The literature clarifies that both the particulate matter and the CO endanger human health while breathed in. The dust from the desert of Sahara is windblown all over the world. CO, in Africa, is from the anthropogenic fire and volcanic eruptions' smoke; these are two good reasons to have focused on Africa. Due to the big size of Africa, five sub-regions are set; these are the western, central, northern, eastern and southern sub-regions. The Goddard interactive online visualization and analysis infrastructure (GIOVANNI) has been a bridge to the collected remote sensing data, in this research. The data was collected online, from the measurement of pollution in the troposphere (MOPITT) as well as a second version of the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications (MERRA-2); the analysis was done by a joint of the software tools, worth noting is the Arc GIS. As the amount of African dust dramatically increased by 2000; the heaviest in 2004, results are based on the selected dust deposition over 2000-2018: time-averaged maps, correlations, and quantitative estimations are reported in this research. The heaviest annual dust deposition reached 25.3 t/km(2) over the year 2004, in Liberia, a focal point of study for the western sub-region. An important finding: the dust's PM2.5 positively correlated with multispectral CO from November to May; the positively high correlation coefficient was 0.86 in April 2018. The negative correlation between the two measurements started from June to October; the negatively high correlation was 0.68 in October 2015; this research discussed the possible reasons. This research recommends some onsite studies about the real figures and facts about the dust's effects on health, in all the seasons; thus, an alert to policymakers who would set some strategies to mitigate the dust hazards on the health of African inhabitants, neighbors, and visitors.

TI  - Frozen section examination of sentinel lymph nodes can be used as a decisional tool in the surgical management of early cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSentinel lymph node (SLN) detection has been shown to be accurate in detecting lymph node involvement in early-stage cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of frozen section examination in the assessment of SLN status, with the aim of adequately driving the intra-operative decision.MethodsWe designed a retrospective study including patients from two comprehensive cancer centers between January 2001 and December 2018 with early-stage cervical cancer (IA1-IB2 according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018) undergoing SLN dissection. The SLN procedure was performed using a cervical injection with technetium-99m combined with blue dye or indocyanine green in most cases.ResultsA total of 176 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Bilateral mapping was detected in 153 (86.7%) of them. Nineteen of these patients (12.4%) had SLN involvement: 13 with macrometastases, three with micrometastases and three with isolated tumor cells (ITC). Macrometastatic disease was missed on frozen section in 3/13 FIGO 2018 stage IIIC patients. The three patients with ITC were also missed by frozen section examination.Considering only macrometastases as lymph node involvement, frozen section sensitivity was 76.9% (95% CI 49.7 to 91.8) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.9% (95% CI 94.0 to 99.3) in patients with bilateral detection. Including micrometastases, sensitivity was 81.2% (95% CI 57.0 to 93.4) and NPV remained at 97.9% (95% CI 93.9 to 99.3).ConclusionsWith a prevalence of final-stage IIIC in patients with pre-operative early-stage cervical cancer of the order of 10% in this series, the NPV of frozen section examination of SLN is very high, with an inferior limit of the CI superior to 94%. Diagnostic accuracy remains acceptable even if micrometastases are considered. The impact of missed ITC has not been established. Frozen section examination can be incorporated in the intra-operative decision algorithm.

TI  - ARCHIVE OF V.N. CHERNETSOV AS A CREATIVE LABORATORY OF A RESEARCHER (1920S)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the problem of the anthropological factor in science. The archive of the famous Russian ethnographer V.N. Chernetsov who studied the Ugric peoples, was the base for personally related field research reconstruction. Using the graphological examination of the texts, three types of the fieldnotes were distinguished: diaries and "ethnographic notes" as "fair" copies and a draft version of fixing material obtained by observation and in-depth interviewing. In addition, the archive contains reports on the expeditions of V.N. Chernetsov, including a much more substantial component of analytics and generalizations. They are written as the fair copies.For a versatile approach to the field laboratory of V.N. Chernetsov, the initial period of his ethnographic collections at the Mansi - the 1920s is distinguished. It is established that the story and the poetic exposition of the myth closely related to it refer to the first ethnographic expedition of the scientist on the river Lozjva in 1925. The subject of expeditionary gatherings was localized mainly in the tangible heritage; information on traditional beliefs is extremely rare. Perhaps, this was partly due to the fact that a proper measure of trust between the researcher and informants still had not been established. A report on this expedition, demonstrating a good command of the basics of the material culture analysis methodology, suggests that it was made after V.N. Chernetsov's entering Leningrad University. In the second expedition, the adjustment of thematic priorities is clearly visible: much more attention is paid to the traditional worldview and the interest in the Mansi social order. Perhaps the evolution of V.N. Chernetsov's views as a second-year ethnographer student was influenced by V.G. Bogoraz, who taught a course on intangible heritage.In relation to field research of V.N. Chernetsov in the 1920s it could obviously said about the included observation and the method of empathy, that is, empathy with current events, the desire to share the same scale of assessments and values as the ethnos under study. The desire of V.N. Chernetsov in the first expedition to merge with the Mansi, become like them, is clear from his fieldnotes. Based on this, primary attention was paid to the regular study of the Mansi language in the context of ethnographic everyday life. The methodology of field research, in turn, was determined by the general humanistic attitude of V.N. Chernetsov to the indigenous peoples of Siberia, which also appears from the fieldnotes. Among field materials in the 1920s "ethnographic notes" prevailed as a fixation of the directly observed realities of ethnic culture. Based on them, generalizing texts were written characterizing the culture of the studied Mansi group as a whole. The appeal to the diary format was occasional.

TI  - Primitives as building blocks for constructing land cover maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps play an integral role in environmental management. However, countries and institutes encounter many challenges with producing timely, efficient, and temporally harmonized updates to their land cover maps. To address these issues we present a modular Regional Land Cover Monitoring System (RLCMS) architecture that is easily customized to create land cover products using primitive map layers. Primitive map layers are a suite of biophysical and end member maps, with land cover primitives representing the raw information needed to make decisions in a dichotomous key for land cover classification. We present best practices to create and assemble primitives from optical satellite using computing technologies, decision tree logic and Monte Carlo simulations to integrate their uncertainties. The concept is presented in the context of a regional land cover map based on a shared regional typology with 18 land cover classes agreed on by stakeholders from Cambodia, Laos PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. We created annual map and uncertainty layers for the period 2000-2017. We found an overall accuracy of 94% when taking uncertainties into account. RLCMS produces consistent time series products using free long term historical Landsat and MODIS data. The customizable architecture can include a variety of sensors and machine learning algorithms to create primitives and the best suited smoothing can be applied on a primitive level. The system is transferable to all regions around the globe because of its use of publicly available global data (Landsat and MODIS) and easily adaptable architecture that allows for the incorporation of a customizable assembly logic to map different land cover typologies based on the user's landscape monitoring objectives

TI  - Classification of terrain based on geo-environmental parameters and their relationship with land use/land cover in Bansloi River basin, Eastern India: RS-GIS approach
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrain classification is a process of classifying the Earth's surface into units or sub-units based on the similarities in terrain properties, geomorphological characteristics, geological characteristics, morphometric properties, soil characteristics, etc. Thus, it possibly represents a qualitative and quantitative description of landforms. The present study intends to carry out terrain classification and to figure out the relationship between terrain classes and land use/land cover in plateau fringe watershed of Bansloi River, Eastern India. Terrain has been classified based on the hierarchical method using geomorphological, lithological, morphometric diversity and soil texture units in GIS environment. Nine morphometric variables (relative relief, dissection index, drainage density, slope, etc.) have been used for deriving morphometric diversity of this basin based on simple compositing method. Land use/land cover categories have been performed by means of supervised classification on Landsat image. In Bansloi River basin, 112 terrain classes have been identified and correlated with land use/land cover. Presently, within 65.87% areas of the total basin agriculture, activities are practiced. Structural origin terrain classes are mainly covered by vegetation, and fluvial origin terrain classes are in use of agricultural activities and built-up land. These micro-level terrain classes and land use/land cover map can be used for agricultural planning and watershed management.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Temperature in an Agricultural Region of Bangladesh from Landsat 8: Intercomparison of Four Algorithms
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of two thermal bands in Landsat 8 brings the opportunity to use either one or both of these bands to retrieve Land Surface Temperature (LST). In order to compare the performances of existing algorithms, we used four methods to retrieve LST from Landsat 8 and made an intercomparison among them. Apart from the direct use of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), Single-Channel Algorithm and two Split-Window Algorithms were used taking an agricultural region in Bangladesh as the study area. The LSTs retrieved in the four methods were validated in two ways: first, an indirect validation against reference LST, which was obtained in the Atmospheric and Topographic CORection (ATCOR) software module; second, cross-validation with Terra MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily LSTs that were obtained from the Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (A rho rho EEARS) online tool. Due to the absence of LST-monitoring radiosounding instruments surrounding the study area, in situ LSTs were not available; hence, validation of satellite retrieved LSTs against in situ LSTs was not performed. The atmospheric parameters necessary for the RTE-based method, as well as for other methods, were calculated from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) database using an online atmospheric correction calculator with MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) codes. Root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) against reference LST, as well as mean bias error against both reference and MODIS daily LSTs, was used to interpret the relative accuracy of LST results. All four methods were found to result in acceptable LST products, leaving atmospheric water vapor content (w) as the important determinant for the precision result. Considering a set of several Landsat 8 images of different dates, Jimenez-Munoz et al.'s (2014) Split-Window algorithm was found to result in the lowest mean RMSE of 1.19 degrees C. Du et al.'s (2015) Split-Window algorithm resulted in mean RMSE of 1.50 degrees C. The RTE-based direct method and the Single-Channel algorithm provided the mean RMSE of 2.47 degrees C and 4.11 degrees C, respectively. For Du et al.'s algorithm, the w range of 0.0 to 6.3 g cm(-2) was considered, whereas for the other three methods, w values as retrieved from the NCEP database were considered for corresponding images. Land surface emissivity was retrieved through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-threshold method. This intercomparison study provides an LST retrieval methodology for Landsat 8 that involves four algorithms. It proves that (i) better LST results can be obtained using both thermal bands of Landsat 8; (ii) the NCEP database can be used to determine atmospheric parameters using the online calculator; (iii) MODIS daily LSTs from A rho rho EEARS can be used efficiently in cross-validation and intercomparison of Landsat 8 LST algorithms; and (iv) when in situ LST data are not available, the ATCOR-derived LSTs can be used for indirect verification and intercomparison of Landsat 8 LST algorithms.

TI  - Emissivity of agricultural soil attributes in southeastern Brazil via terrestrial and satellite sensors
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture and organic carbon (OC) content influence the spectral response. These attributes are relevant for the preservation and proper management of land use in the pursuit of a sustainable agriculture. Laboratory and satellite sensors have been applied as a powerful tool for studying so is, but their analysis using these sensors has mainly focused on the visible (Vis), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electro-magnetic spectrum, with few studies in the Medium Infrared (MIR). The aim of this study was to identify the spectral pattern of soils with different granulometry (sand and clay) and OC content using laboratory and satellite sensors in the MIR region, specifically in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) range (ASTER, Landsat satellites). The study performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of clay, OC and sand fractions (fine and coarse). The study area is located in the region of Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where collected 150 soil samples (0-20 cm depth). Soil texture was determined by the pipette method and OC via dry combustion. Reflectance and emissivity (epsilon) spectral data were obtained with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Alpha sensor (Bruker Optics Corporation). An image "ASTER 05" from July 15, 2017 was acquired with values of epsilon. Samples were separated by textural classes and the spectral behavior in the TIR region was described. The data obtained by the laboratory sensor were resampled to the satellite sensor bands. The behavior between spectra of both sensors was similar and had significant correlation with the studied attributes, mainly sand. For the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, six strategies were used (MIR, MIR_ASTER, ASTER, TIR, TIR Correlation Index (TIR_CID), and MIR Correlation Index (MIR_CID)), which consisted in the use of all sensors bands, or by the selection of bands that presented the most significant correlations with each one of the attributes. Models presented a good performance in the prediction of all attributes using the whole MIR. In the TIR region, the models for total sand content and for fine and coarse fractions were good. Models created with ASTER sensor data were not as promising as those with laboratory ones. The use of specific bands was useful in estimating some attributes in the MIR and TIR, improving the predictive performance and validation of models. Therefore, the discrimination of soil attributes with satellite sensors can be improved with the identification of specific bands, as observed in the results with laboratory sensors.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of Erosion and Accretion: A Case of a Large Tropical River
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly changing river systems can impact people, property and infrastructures. This study investigates bank erosion and accretion of the Padma River in Bangladesh, through space and time, using historical topographic maps, Corona and Landsat images and navigational charts. A geographic information system (GIS) was utilised to quantify the erosion and accretion pattern. In addition, volumetric changes in the riverbed were also investigated. Results indicated that the area of erosion and deposition vary both spatially and temporally. However, erosion was more prominent on the left bank, whilst accretion was high along the right bank, over the study period. Overall, average annual erosion rates were higher than accretion rates (17 km(2) year(-1) versus 13 km(2) year(-1)). The volumes of morphological change for two epochs correspond to a net volume gain of 338.75 million m(3) sediment between 1984 and 1992 but a net loss of 295.20 million m(3) during the period 1992-2008. Regression analysis between bank erosion and mean annual flow, peak discharge and mean flood flow showed that two of the three independent variables were significantly associated with bank erosion. The area of large mid-channel bars increased over time, which may have had a role in shaping erosion and accretion processes of the river. As increased runoff is expected in the future, as a result of enhanced rainfall under warmer climate, knowledge of this work will help to determine the morphological response of fluvial systems in Bangladesh and elsewhere.

TI  - Different Worldviews, Different World Literatures? The Contrasting Chronotopes of Ethnic Detective Fiction in <i>Pasado Perfecto</i> and <i>The Beggar</i>'<i>s Opera</i>
T2  - FORUM FOR WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article discusses the nature of ethnic detective fiction from the comparative perspective of world literature by underscoring the divergent discourses that can hide under such a seemingly unified subgenre. In the context of our current understanding of world literature, both the Inspector Ramirez series by Canadian crime writer Peggy Blair and the Lieutenant Conde series by Cuban author Leonardo Padura can be categorized as multiethnic, international, minority, multicultural, cross-cultural or ethnic detective fiction, because of the series' focus on the Cuban crime scene. However, a comparison of the action-space, plot-space, and worldview chronotopes (i.e. time-space frames) of The Beggar's Opera and Pasado perfecto reveals that the focalizers of both novels adhere to opposite worldviews. Pasado perfecto's Cuban worldview chronotope largely conforms to the premises of the original hardboiled paradigm, whereas the Canadian worldview of The Beggar's Opera appears to cross over from detective fiction into ethnographic travel fiction. In the end, it would seem the only thing holding both novels together is their shared label of ethnic detective fiction.

TI  - Prediction of the salmon lice infestation pressure in a Norwegian fjord
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A further growth in the Norwegian aquaculture industry might potentially be hampered by the conclusion that it is not environmentally sustainable. As direct measurements of the lice induced mortality on wild salmonids are impossible, the management is based on a set of high-quality and well-documented sustainability indicators. These indicators combine observations from the national Norwegian salmon lice monitoring programme with salmon lice models. Here, we have documented the quality of one of these models used to identify areas where the impact from farmed to wild salmonids is over the prescribed limit. The Hardangerfjord area has been used as a test area, but the model is general and, therefore, suitable for the rest of the coast. It is shown that the model system is robust and also can be used to test whether new knowledge gained from laboratory experiments improves the model. New findings on salmon lice behaviour at low salinities have been incorporated and the new model, consisting of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model coupled with an individual-based salmon lice model and forced with realistic input of salmon lice larvae from aquaculture farms, represents the best realization of the local potential infestation pressure on wild fish.

TI  - Tropical rainfall patterns driven by reduced sea ice in high boreal latitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data enabled the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), through Report V, to indicate that the regional distribution of sea ice has been reducing in the Northern hemisphere high latitudes. This study assimilated that reduction into a general circulation model of intermediate complexity to simulate the tropical rainfall response. The Northern hemisphere tropospheric wind field simulations presented a clear similarity to the Northern Annular Mode negative phase. In particular, the meridional wind anomalies of the Northern hemisphere Ferrel cell suggest that the energy upsurge due to the boreal sea ice decrease results in an increase in the amplitude of the Rossby waves, thus connecting the polar zone to the tropics. The 500 hPa vertical motion and the rainfall distribution in the tropical belt simulations show a southward displacement of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone and also the South Atlantic Convergence Zone. Although several studies indicate the Intertropical Convergence Zone is shifted towards the hemisphere most heated by climatic variations, the apparent disagreement with our results can be understood by considering that some continental sectors in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes have shown cooling in recent years, probably in response to the boreal sea ice decrease.

TI  - Recent wildfires in Central Chile: Detecting links between burned areas and population exposure in the wildland urban interface
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are gaining importance in the Mediterranean regions owing to climatechange and landscape changes due to the increasing closeness between urban areas and forests prone to wildfires. We analysed the dry season wildfire occurrences in the Mediterranean region of Central Chile (32 degrees S-39 degrees 30'S) between 2000 and 2017, using satellite images to detect burned areas, their landscape metrics and the land use and covers (vegetal) pre-wildfire, in order to determine the population living in areas that may be affected by wildfires. The existing regulations in western Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy) were used to identify and define the wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas, quantifying the people inhabiting them and estimating the population affected by burned areas from 2001 to 2017. We used the Google Earth Engine to process MODIS products and extract both burned areas and land covers. We detected that 25% of the urban population inhabits WUI areas (i.e. Biobio, Araucania and Valparaiso regions) where the urban population exposed to burned areas exceeds 40%. Must of the land use and land covers affected by wildfires are anthropogenic land covers, classified as savannas, croplands, evergreen broadleaf forests and woody savannas, representing >70% of the burned areas. Urban areas show only 0.6% of the burned surface from 2001 to 2017. We estimate that 55,680 people are potentially affected by wildfires, and 50% of them are in just one administrative region. These results show the imperative need for public policies as a regulating force for establishing WU1 areas with the purpose of identifying wildfire risk in urban areas, such as establishing prevention methods as firewalls and prescribed fires.

TI  - A Statistical Approach to Detect Land Cover Changes in Mediterranean Ecosystems Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data: The Case Study of Pianosa Island, Italy
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is commonly used to detect spatiotemporal changes of vegetation cover. This study modeled the spatiotemporal changes of land cover on Pianosa Island, Italy, in the period 1999-2015, using the multi-temporal Landsat images. Since the end of the 1990s, the natural vegetation has been re-colonizing an area of abandoned agricultural land and the island is undergoing a process of re-naturalization in harsh (drought and hot) environmental conditions. Hence, it is an ideal test site to monitor the effects of anthropogenic and climatic stressors on vegetation dynamics under Mediterranean climate. In this work, we proposed a new statistical approach based on a pixel-by-pixel analysis of multi-temporal Landsat images. Mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) values of the NDVI images taken in 2015 were used for the determination of the pixel thresholds (mu +/- 3 sigma). The evaluation of land cover change was carried out by comparing the mu value of a single NDVI pixel for 2015 with the same pixel of different years of the study period. The results indicate that surface reflectance (SR) Landsat images are more suitable in detecting the vegetation dynamics on the island than the top of atmosphere (TOA) ones and highlight an increasing trend of vegetation cover on Pianosa Island, mainly during the early seven years following the land abandonment in all the main land cover classes: abandoned crops and pastures, Mediterranean macchia, and woodland. However, the abandoned agricultural and pasture areas showed a higher increase in the vegetation cover and a shift in the shape of the normalized frequency distribution of the SR NDVI data during the study period, suggesting that a colonization process from other vegetation classes is occurring (i.e., Mediterranean macchia and trees are colonizing the abandoned land, partly replacing herbaceous species). Our data highlight that the statistical approach applied in this study is suitable for detecting vegetation cover changes associated with anthropogenic and climatic drivers in a typical Mediterranean environment and could be proposed as a new methodological approach in several other land monitoring studies.

TI  - Disability as Diversity: Perspectives of Institutions of Higher Education in the U.S.
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION AND DISABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Institutions of higher education (IHEs) in the U.S. have implemented policy and practices to support on-campus diversity initiatives. Experiences with diverse populations are particularly relevant to young adults, who are developing their worldview by evaluating their perspectives and the perspectives of others. Because most of the conversations about diversity involve dimensions such as race, gender, and ethnicity, disability or ability is often omitted from such discussions. This study sought to review mission statements and diversity materials of four-year college and university websites in order to understand the extent to which disability is included as a dimension of diversity. As these materials provide the tone and values of the IHE, it may be possible to understand how these schools view disability in relation to diversity. Mixed methods were used to explore the extent to which IHEs include disability in their mission or diversity statements as a way to expand on the notion of diversity within their student body, staff, or faculty. Findings show that most of the randomly selected four-year IHEs (n = 300) do not include disability within their mission or diversity statements. Those who do are often found to include statements that describe campus cultures that are inclusive of students with disabilities and more likely to consider a diverse campus, inclusive of disability, an enriched community. Implications for further research and practice provide recommendations based on the literature on how to improve their inclusiveness of students with disabilities in IHEs.

TI  - Radiometric Comparison within the Sentinel-1 SAR Constellation over a Wide Backscatter Range
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration adjusts the measured pixel intensity to a physical property, the radar cross section (RCS). After calibration, this relationship is defined over the entire backscatter range: from low image power (near noise) up to high reflections (below saturation). Based on a proper radiometric calibration, the measured radar backscatter for the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation is validated over a wide backscatter range using different target types. Therefore, the RCS derived from point targets and radar brightness from distributed targets are compared between Sentinel-1A (S-1A) and Sentinel-1B (S-1B) acquisitions over the same observation area for regions where a stable target backscatter is expected for a certain period of time. Low differences (in the order of 0.3 dB) are found between S-1A and S-1B for high and medium backscatter derived from point targets or rainforest regions, but higher differences for low backscattering regions like ice areas and lakes. For comparing radar brightness containing low backscatter targets, an accurate derived noise level has to be taken into account. In addition to the measured lower noise equivalent beta zero (NEBZ) level, higher transmit power was detected for S-1B compared to S-1A. The higher antenna gain of S-1B leads finally to a higher sensitivity for low backscattering areas of S-1B compared to S-1A and explains the found differences.

TI  - Multi-Source and Multi-Temporal Image Fusion on Hypercomplex Bases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article spanned a new, consistent framework for production, archiving, and provision of analysis ready data (ARD) from multi-source and multi-temporal satellite acquisitions and an subsequent image fusion. The core of the image fusion was an orthogonal transform of the reflectance channels from optical sensors on hypercomplex bases delivered in Kennaugh-like elements, which are well-known from polarimetric radar. In this way, SAR and Optics could be fused to one image data set sharing the characteristics of both: the sharpness of Optics and the texture of SAR. The special properties of Kennaugh elements regarding their scaling-linear, logarithmic, normalized-applied likewise to the new elements and guaranteed their robustness towards noise, radiometric sub-sampling, and therewith data compression. This study combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on an Octonion basis as well as Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2 on a Sedenion basis. The validation using signatures of typical land cover classes showed that the efficient archiving in 4 bit images still guaranteed an accuracy over 90% in the class assignment. Due to the stability of the resulting class signatures, the fuzziness to be caught by Machine Learning Algorithms was minimized at the same time. Thus, this methodology was predestined to act as new standard for ARD remote sensing data with an subsequent image fusion processed in so-called data cubes.

TI  - A combined-method approach to trace submarine groundwater discharge from a coastal karst aquifer in Ireland
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the hydraulic connections between submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and its terrestrial coastal catchment is relevant with regard to the management of marine and coastal waters in karst areas. This study applies different methods and monitoring approaches to trace SGD between the Burren Limestone Plateau and Galway Bay in western Ireland, via an excavated sinkhole shaft and deep conduit. Areas of potential SGD were first delineated based on sea surface temperature anomalies using Landsat satellite images. Two fluorescent dyes and solid wood chips were then used as tracers. Solid wood chips were tested as potential means to circumvent the problem of high dispersion in the sea, impacting on the fluorescent dyes to yield readings below the detection limits. Sampling was conducted at 10 different terrestrial locations and in the sea at Galway Bay. Offshore sampling was conducted in transects over a period of four successive days onboard of a vessel using an automated field fluorometer and a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor. No wood chips were recovered in the sea but both fluorescent dyes were successfully sampled. The estimated travel times are in the order of 100 to 354 m/h, and localised tracer readings correlate well in space and time with low conductivity readings. By confirming hydraulic connections between the two karst features and Galway Bay, the study substantiates the hypothesised importance of Variscan veins with regard to regional groundwater flow in the region.

TI  - Mid-season county-level corn yield forecast for US Corn Belt integrating satellite imagery and weather variables
T2  - CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield estimations are of great interest to support interventions from governmental policies and to increase global food security. This study presents a novel model to perform in-season corn yield predictions at the US-county level, providing robust results under different weather and yield levels. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the performance of a random forest classification to identify corn fields using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and weather variables (temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure deficit, VPD); (ii) evaluate the contribution of weather variables when forecasting corn yield via remote sensing data, and perform a sensitivity analysis to explore the model performance in different dates; and (iii) develop a model pipeline for performing in-season corn yield predictions at county-scale. Main outcomes from this study were: (i) high accuracy (87% on average) for corn field classification achieved in late August, (ii) corn yield forecasts with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.89 Mg ha(-1), (iii) weather variables (VPD and temperature) highly influenced the model performance, and (iv) model performance decreased when predictions were performed early in the season (mid-July), with MAE increasing from 0.87-1.36 Mg ha(-1) when forecast timing changed from day of year 232-192. This research portrays the benefits of integrating statistical techniques and remote sensing to field survey data in order to perform more reliable in-season corn yield forecasts.

TI  - Recurrence Analysis of Vegetation Indices for Highlighting the Ecosystem Response to Drought Events: An Application to the Amazon Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are important in sequestering CO2 and therefore play a significant role in climate change. However, the CO2 cycle is conditioned by drought events that alter the rate of photosynthesis, which is the principal physiological action of plants in transforming CO2 into biological energy. This study applied recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to describe the evolution of photosynthesis-related indices to highlight disturbance alterations produced by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO, years 2005 and 2010) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO, year 2015) in the Amazon forest. The analysis was carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to build time series of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the land surface temperature (LST) covering the period 2001-2018. The results did not show significant variations produced by AMO throughout the study area, while a disruption due to the global warming phase linked to the extreme ENSO event occurred, and the forest was able to recover. In addition, spatial differences in the response of the forest to the ENSO event were found. These findings show that the application of RQA to the time series of vegetation indices supports the evaluation of the forest ecosystem response to disruptive events. This approach provides information on the capacity of the forest to recover after a disruptive event and, therefore is useful to estimate the resilience of this particular ecosystem.

TI  - Canopy Height Estimation at Landsat Resolution Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure estimation is very important in geological, ecological and environmental studies. It provides the basis for the carbon stock estimation and effective means of sequestration of carbon sources and sinks. Multiple parameters are used to estimate the forest structure like above ground biomass, leaf area index and diameter at breast height. Among all these parameters, vegetation height has unique standing. In addition to forest structure estimation it provides the insight into long term historical changes and the estimates of stand age of the forests as well. There are multiple techniques available to estimate the canopy height. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based methods, being the accurate and useful ones, are very expensive to obtain and have no global coverage. There is a need to establish a mechanism to estimate the canopy height using freely available satellite imagery like Landsat images. Multiple studies are available which contribute in this area. The majority use Landsat images with random forest models. Although random forest based models are widely used in remote sensing applications, they lack the ability to utilize the spatial association of neighboring pixels in modeling process. In this research work, we define Convolutional Neural Network based model and analyze that model for three test configurations. We replicate the random forest based setup of Grant et al., which is a similar state-of-the-art study, and compare our results and show that the convolutional neural networks (CNN) based models not only capture the spatial association of neighboring pixels but also outperform the state-of-the-art.

TI  - Effective management of slums- Case study of Kalaburagi city, Karnataka, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As urbanization grows, we may expect that slums will tend to grow even faster. Kalaburagi is a second tier city and an important commercial hub for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region located in the north eastern part of Karnataka state. It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11% of city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to advance the living conditions of slum dwellers.Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented. As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA) model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors. When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective implementation of slum development programs.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS-based analysis of urban dynamics and modelling of its drivers, the case of Pingtan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the urban land dynamics and its causes is critical to manage and predict both urban development and its associated environmental qualities. However, little is known and documented about the historical urban land dynamics in Pingtan. By integrating remote sensing, geographic information systems and statistical analysis, this study aims to quantify and map the spatiotemporal urban dynamics using Landsat imageries in four timespans (1984, 1996, 2007 and 2017) along with driving factors. It specifically addressed urban expansion intensity, forms of expansion, transitions, nature of landscape and modelled socioeconomic drivers. The results revealed that urban land expanded by 18.19% (57.55 km(2)) during 1984-2017 and its intensity of expansion was rapid (>= 0.5). The expanded area was mainly originated from farmland (70.3%) followed by shrub land, water bodies and grassland (21.8% altogether). Metrics of urban landscape revealed a continuous increase in shape irregularity and size variability among patches. The level of fragmentation also increased from 1984 to 2007. However, from 2007 onward, patches' aggregation started to prevail. Urban expansion was significantly driven by socioeconomic factors (variable importance in the projection > 1) like urban population, GDP from different sectors, income and road constructions. Policies of economic development and spatial planning laws also affected urban expansion. Although urban densification showed an upward trend, urban expansion was dominant. Leapfrog and edge expansion together accounts > 80% of newly expanded urban areas. Hence, a big challenge in the future will be how to limit urban expansion, promote its densification and manage associated environmental impacts sustainably in the face of dynamic socioeconomic and policy factors.

TI  - Estimating the starting time and identifying the type of urbanization based on dense time series of landsat-derived Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) maps - A case study of North Taiwan from 1990 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and land use change (LCLUC) is a global phenomenon, and LCLUC in urbanizing regions has substantial impacts on humans and their environments. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach to identifying the type and starting time of urbanization was developed and tested based on dense time series of Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) maps derived from Landsat surface reflectance imagery. The accuracy of modeled V-I-S fractions and the estimated time of initial change in impervious cover were assessed. North Taiwan, one of the regions of the island of Taiwan that experienced the greatest urban LCLUC, was chosen as a test area, and the study period is 1990 to 2015, a period of substantial urbanization. In total, 295 dates of Landsat imagery were used to create 295 V-I-S fraction maps that were used to construct fractional cover time series for each pixel. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)s for the modeled Vegetation, Impervious, and Soil were 25 %, 22 %, 24 % respectively. The time of Urban Expansion is estimated by logistic regression applied to Impervious cover time series, while the time of change for Urban Renewal is determined by the period of brief Soil exposure. The identified location and estimated time for newly urbanized lands were generally accurate, with 80% of Urban Expansion estimated within +/- 2.4 years. However, the accuracy of identified Urban Renewal was relatively low. Our approach to identifying Urban Expansion with dense time series of Landsat imagery is shown to be reliable, while Urban Renewal identification is not.

TI  - Impact of Environmental and Climate Factors on Spatial Distribution of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Northeastern Iran: Utilizing Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a dermal and parasitic disease.. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of environmental and climate factors on spatial distribution of CL in northeastern Iran by utilizing remote sensing from 20 March 2016 to 19 March 2017.Methods: In this ecological study, the data were divided into two parts: The descriptive data on human CL cases were gathered from Communicable Diseases center of Iran. The remote sensing techniques and satellite imagery data (TRMM, MODIS-Aqua, MODIS-Terra and AMSR-2 with spatial resolution 0.25 degrees, 0.05 degrees, 5600m and 10km) of environmental and climate factors were used to determine the spatial pattern changes of cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence.Results: The incidence of CL in North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, and South Khorasan was 35.80 per 100,000 people (309/863092), 34.14 per 100,000 people (2197/6,434,501) and 7.67 per 100,000 people (59/768,898), respectively. The incidence of CL had the highest correlation with soil moisture and evapotranspiration. Moreover, the incidence of disease was significantly correlated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and air humidity while it had the lowest correlation with rainfall. Furthermore, the CL incidence had an indirect correlation relation with the air temperature meaning that with an increase in the temperature, the incidence of disease decreased.Conclusion: As such, the incidence of disease was also higher in the northern regions; most areas of North Khorasan and northern regions of Razavi Khorasan; where the rainfall, vegetation, specific humidity, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture was higher than the southern areas.

TI  - Parameter analysis and optimization using genetic algorithm in a marine ecosystem model of the northern South China Sea
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine ecosystem dynamics model is an important means to study marine ecological environment. As the model complexity increases, the number and uncertainty of biological parameters increase, which has a great impact on model results; therefore, optimization of model parameters is particularly important. In this paper, a one-dimensional physical-biological model is applied to the northern South China Sea, and the key biological parameters obtained through sensitivity analysis are optimized by using genetic algorithm. The results show that the sensitive parameters in the model are related to phytoplankton growth, zooplankton growth, feeding and death, and detritus sinking. Based on the genetic algorithm optimization of the above-mentioned parameters, we find that the surface and vertical simulation errors of the model are reduced by 27.80% and 21.40%, respectively, by using only surface satellite data; the surface and vertical simulation errors are reduced by 14.90% and 32.70%, respectively, by adding observed profile data. The success of applying genetic algorithm in the one-dimensional model provides the basis for its further application in three-dimensional marine ecosystem models.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, remote sensing data, such as that of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), has been used to monitor the distribution of rain over time and space. The objective of this work was to evaluate the quality of the rainfall data estimated by the product 3B43-TRMM in the state of Sergipe, on the monthly and annual scales, between 1998 and 2013. The point values estimated by the TRMM were compared with the precipitation data obtained in 13 pluviometric stations of the National Water Agency (ANA). The statistical indications considered were the coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (EMA), root of the mean square error (REQM) and Willmott's agreement index (d). The R-2 values were 0.49 and 0.16 on the monthly and annual scales, respectively. For the monthly time scale, the best estimates of the TRMM product were found in the semi-arid region of the state of Sergipe, with values of R-2, EMA, REQM and d equal to 0.54, 27.18 mm and 38.71 mm and 0.83, respectively.

TI  - Direct assimilation of measured soil water content in Root Zone Water Quality Model calibration for deficit-irrigated maize
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Correct soil water simulation is critical for water balance and plant growth in agricultural systems. Crop production simulation errors have often been attributed to a lack of accuracy in soil water content (SWC) estimates. However, only a few studies have quantified the effects of SWC estimate errors on crop production and evapotranspiration (ET), especially under different irrigation treatments. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of direct assimilation of measured SWC during model calibration for deficit irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) on simulated ET, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and yield. The CERES-Maize model within the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) was calibrated using the automatic parameter estimation (PEST) software. Simulation results showed that, using PEST-optimized crop parameters, RZWQM was able to adequately predict crop yield (relative root mean squared error, rRMSE, of 4.8%) and biomass (rRMSE of 7.1%) in response to irrigation levels, in spite of the bias in SWC and ET simulation. However, with the same crop parameters but replacing simulated SWC with measured data, simulations of crop yield and biomass became worse, with higher rRMSE values (14.5% for yield and 21.5% for biomass). This unexpected model performance with SWC assimilation was mainly associated with the water addition and removal from the soil, which was improved only by recalibration of both soil and crop parameters. This study suggested compensating effects between soil and crop parameters during model calibration. Caution should be applied when using measured SWC as model inputs, especially under water stress conditions.

TI  - Effects of Community-Based Watershed Development on Landscape Greenness and Vegetation Cover in the Northwestern Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the effects of community-based watershed development (CBWD) on landscape greenness and vegetation cover in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. It also evaluates implications of results on ecological conditions and rural livelihoods. Paired-sites comparison approach was used, and compared landscape greenness and vegetation cover at conserved (Tija Baji) and non-conserved (Tata) watersheds for the period 2000-2015. Landsat images for 2000 and 2015 were the datasets used, and analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was employed to detect landscape greenness. The results showed that landscape greenness represented by high NDVI value (>0.02) increased in the conserved watershed and decreased in the non-conserved watershed during the study period. The observed change in landscape greenness in both watersheds was due to the change in shrub land and grassland covers. Shrub land and grassland covers increased by 20.6 ha and 22.5 ha in the conserved watershed and decreased by 50 ha and 49.3 ha in the control watershed, respectively. The decreasing change in landscape greenness in the control watershed was due to the conversion of shrub land and grassland into cropland and bare land covers. Cropland and bare land covers in the control watershed increased by 41.9 ha and 26.7 ha, respectively. In contrast, these land covers declined by 30.4 ha and 23.3 ha in the conserved watershed, respectively. The observed changes in landscape greenness, cropland and bare land covers in the conserved watershed have important implications for the improvement of soil fertility, biodiversity, soil erosion and flood control, ground water recharge, carbon sequestration and on rural livelihood systems.

AB  - The results of studying a variability of internal-gravity-wave characteristics and their signatures based on satellite data are presented. Observations of the wave processes under study over the Russian Federation Pacific coast in the period from 2015 to 2017 are considered. High-periodic Himawari-8 satellite images and thematic products of their processing are used. The methods and algorithms for retrieving parameters of internal gravity waves and their cloud manifestations are described. Trends for various characteristics of wave processes under study are constructed. The typical variability of parameters of internal gravity waves and their signatures is revealed on the basis of the longest lasting episodes of their observation. The results of analysis of coefficients of correlation between the various characteristics of the wave processes under study are presented. Similar episodes of observing signatures of internal gravity waves for the time period under study are established. The processes occurring in the "atmosphere-underlying surface" system and their influence on the creation of favorable conditions for the generation and propagation of wave processes under study are discussed.

TI  - Measuring Microbiome Effectiveness: A Role for Ingestible Sensors
T2  - GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Across the world there is an increasingly heavy burden of noncommunicable diseases related to obesity, mental health, and atopic disease. In a previous publication, we followed the developing idea that that these conditions arise as our microbiome loses diversity, but there seems to be no generally applicable way to assess the significance of this loss. Our work revisited the findings of the African studies by Denis Burkitt who reported that the frequency of what he called Western diseases were inversely proportional to the average faecal volumes of affected populations. Although he ascribed this to fibre in the diet, it now seems more likely that the drop in faecal volume with the onset of disease is due to the loss of a fully functioning microbiome. We suggested that the microbiome could be considered to be a single mutualistic microbial community interacting with our body by two complementary sets of semiochemicals, i.e., allomones to feed the microbiota by facilitating the efficient transfer of nutrition through the gut and kairomones to calibrate our immune system by an as yet unknown mechanism. The bioactive compounds, dopamine and serotonin, are known to be present in the gut lumen under the influence of intestinal microbiota and we suggest that these are part of this allomone-like system. In light of this possibility, it is of critical importance to develop a method of quantifying the microbiome effectiveness. Ingestible sensors consist of a miniaturized detector and transmitter packed into a capsule that is swallowed and tracked through the intestine. The aim of this article is to explore the possible development of such ingestible detectors for these or other compounds that can act as a surrogate marker for microbiome effectiveness. We consider that the ability to provide real-time quantitative information on the interaction of the microbiome with different nutrients promises to be a valuable new tool to unravel the mystery of these noncommunicable illnesses, i.e., microbiome-function deficiency diseases.

TI  - A Meta-Methodology for Improving Land Cover and Land Use Classification with SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Per-point classification is a traditional method for remote sensing data classification, and for radar data in particular. Compared with optical data, the discriminative power of radar data is quite limited, for most applications. A way of trying to overcome these difficulties is to use Region-Based Classification (RBC), also referred to as Geographical Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). RBC methods first aggregate pixels into homogeneous objects, or regions, using a segmentation procedure. Moreover, segmentation is known to be an ill-conditioned problem because it admits multiple solutions, and a small change in the input image, or segmentation parameters, may lead to significant changes in the image partitioning. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates novel approaches for SAR data classification, which rely on specialized segmentations, and on the combination of partial maps produced by classification ensembles. Such approaches comprise a meta-methodology, in the sense that they are independent from segmentation and classification algorithms, and optimization procedures. Results are shown that improve the classification accuracy from Kappa = 0.4 (baseline method) to a Kappa = 0.77 with the presented method. Another test site presented an improvement from Kappa = 0.36 to a maximum of 0.66 also with radar data.

TI  - A Method for the Analysis of Small Crop Fields in Sentinel-2 Dense Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image time series (SITS), such as those by Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, provides a large amount of information due to their combined temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The high revisit frequency and spatial resolution of S2 result in: 1) increase in the probability of acquiring cloud-free images and 2) availability of detailed information for analyzing small objects. These characteristics are of interest in precision agriculture, where temporally dense SITS can benefit the understanding of crop behaviors. In the past, information about agricultural practices has been collected over large regions and focused on mixed/aggregated crops due to the poor tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions. Products have been generated at low spatial resolution and daily basis or at high spatial resolution and weekly/monthly basis. They are meaningful for large agricultural fields, whereas they are limited when fields show a small average size. In this context, S2 characteristics allow for both high spatial and temporal resolution products. However, no existing automatic method effectively separates small fields from each other in an unsupervised way and deals with data irregularly sampled in time. Thus, this article presents a method suitable for the analysis of small crop fields in S2 dense SITS that accounts for S2 characteristics. The method fuses spatio-temporal information, analyzes data spatio-temporal evolution, and extracts relevant spatio-temporal information. The effectiveness of the proposed method was corroborated by experiments carried out on S2-SITS acquired over an area located in Barrax, Spain.

TI  - Assessment of relationship between the surface temperatures and built-up urban environment in Ankara city center
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: This study focuses on determining relationship between the surface temperatures of Ankara (Turkey) thermal load in this regard and built-up environment of city using Local Climate Zone system.Methodology: This study consists of two basic stages. formation of thermal load map and analysis of relationship between surface temperatures, the LCZs, and the built-up environment by determining these LCZs. Firstly, metadata from Landsat 8-OLI satellite images were used to perform the surface temperature analysis, than building surface fractions, and building height figures were analyzed, and the thermal load in the area was determined. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between surface temperature, building surface fraction and building height. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to see difference between the surface temperatures regarding LCZs. Tukey's test, one of multiple comparison (Post Hoc) tests used in one-way variance analysis, was performed to compare the groups with each other.Results: According to assessment of surface temperatures by LCZs, the lowest temperature (33.0 degrees C) was seen in LCZ-A with a dense tree pattern, while the highest value (44.5 degrees C) was detected in LCZ-8 which had buildings with low stories on a broad base and impervious neighboring areas. This study evaluated whether there was a relationship between surface temperature, building fractions, and building height in terms of LCZs. A relationship was found between the surface temperatures and building surface fraction in LCZ-2 and LCZ-5, but no relationship was present in other zones. There was a relationship between the surface temperature and building height in LCZ-3 and LCZ-5, however, no relationship was found in other zones.Interpretation: The Local Climate Zone system developed by Oke and Stewart should be supported by technical research and field studies, and should be adapted in Turkish cities.

TI  - Validation of Space-Based Albedo Products from Upscaled Tower-Based Measurements Over Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a fundamental radiative parameter as it controls the Earth's energy budget and directly affects the Earth's climate. Satellite observations have long been used to capture the temporal and spatial variations of surface albedo because of their continuous global coverage. However, space-based albedo products are often affected by errors in the atmospheric correction, multi-angular bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) modelling, as well as spectral conversions. To validate space-based albedo products, an in situ tower albedometer is often used to provide continuous "ground truth" measurements of surface albedo over an extended area. Since space-based albedo and tower-measured albedo are produced at different spatial scales, they can be directly compared only for specific homogeneous land surfaces. However, most land surfaces are inherently heterogeneous with surface properties that vary over a wide range of spatial scales. In this work, tower-measured albedo products, including both directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR) and bi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR), are upscaled to coarse satellite spatial resolutions using a new method. This strategy uses high-resolution satellite derived surface albedos to fill the gaps between the albedometer's field-of-view (FoV) and coarse satellite scales. The high-resolution surface albedo is generated from a combination of surface reflectance retrieved from high-resolution Earth Observation (HR-EO) data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF climatology over a larger area. We implemented a recently developed atmospheric correction method, the Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC), to retrieve surface reflectance from HR-EO (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance measurements. This SIAC processing provides an estimated uncertainty for the retrieved surface spectral reflectance at the HR-EO pixel level and shows excellent agreement with the standard Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) in retrieving Landsat-8 surface reflectance. Atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 data is vastly improved by SIAC when compared against the use of in situ AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data. Based on this, we can trace the uncertainty of tower-measured albedo during its propagation through high-resolution EO measurements up to coarse satellite scales. These upscaled albedo products can then be compared with space-based albedo products over heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both tower-measured albedo and upscaled albedo products are examined at Ground Based Observation for Validation (GbOV) stations (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/gbov/), and used to compare with satellite observations, including Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) based on ProbaV and VEGETATION 2 data, MODIS and multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR).

TI  - Characteristics of Mainland Coastline Changes in Southeast Asia during the 21st Century
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on multitemporal Landsat images covering the entire coastal zone, a visual interpretation method was adopted to extract the coastlines of mainland Southeast Asia (MSA) in 2000 and 2015 referencing Google Earth images and global distribution of mangrove data. Coastline structures, coastline fractal dimensions, coastline change rates, and patterns of land-sea interchange were analyzed to reveal the spatial-temporal characteristics of mainland coastline changes in the 21st century. The results showed that (1) during the past 15 years, the length and percentage of natural coastline decreased from 15,440.24 km (83.33%) to 14,909.75 km (78.91%) and artificial coastlines increased at an average growth rate of 29.04% from 3088.79 to 3985.89 km; (2) the fractal dimensions of most areas in MSA tended to increase under interference driven by human activities, and the coastline morphology became more complex overall; (3) coastlines had obvious evolution, in which 18.54% of the coastline advanced toward the sea and 11.25% retreated toward land at average rates of +20.36 and -15.41 m.a(-1), respectively; and (4) the number of patches representing land-sea interchange reached 6607 so that the net land expansion area was 534.25 km(2) and among these regions, those larger than 1 km(2) accounted for only a small percentage (2.54%) of the total number but 79.41% of the total area. These hot spots were mainly concentrated in Myanmar, followed by Vietnam and Malaysia. Overall, the coastline of MSA was characterized by rapid artificial growth but still had a high percentage of naturalization. When it comes to developing the marine economy and addressing the ecological risk, the intensity of utilization and hardening of the coastline will likely increase.

TI  - Using MODIS LAI Data to Monitor Spatio-Temporal Changes of Winter Wheat Phenology in Response to Climate Warming
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatio-temporal changes in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) phenology and its response to temperature will be vital for adapting to climate change in the coming years. For this purpose, the heading date (HD), maturity date (MD), and length of the reproductive growth period (LRGP) were detected from the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) data by a threshold-based method during the harvest year 2003 to 2018 across the North China Plain. The results show that there was high spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat phenology in pixel scale across the whole area, which could not be detected in previous site-based studies. The results also verified that climate warming could explain part of the change in the HD. However, for the LRGP, the potential impact of non-climate effects should be further investigated. This study presents the spatio-temporal changes both in winter wheat phenology and corresponding mean temperature and then analyzes their relationships in pixel scale. Additionally, this study further discusses the potential impact of non-climate effects on the LRGP.

TI  - Non-Destructive Detection of Tea Leaf Chlorophyll Content Using Hyperspectral Reflectance and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea trees are kept in shaded locations to increase their chlorophyll content, which influences green tea quality. Therefore, monitoring change in chlorophyll content under low light conditions is important for managing tea trees and producing high-quality green tea. Hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the most frequently used methods for estimating chlorophyll content. Numerous studies based on data collected under relatively low-stress conditions and many hyperspectral indices and radiative transfer models show that shade-grown tea performs poorly. The performance of four machine learning algorithms-random forest, support vector machine, deep belief nets, and kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM)-in evaluating data collected from tea leaves cultivated under different shade treatments was tested. KELM performed best with a root-mean-square error of 8.94 +/- 3.05 mu g cm(-2) and performance to deviation values from 1.70 to 8.04 for the test data. These results suggest that a combination of hyperspectral reflectance and KELM has the potential to trace changes in the chlorophyll content of shaded tea leaves.

TI  - Implementation of a Surface Water Extent Model in Cambodia using Cloud-Based Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping surface water over time provides the spatially explicit information essential for hydroclimatic research focused on droughts and flooding. Hazard risk assessments and water management planning also rely on accurate, long-term measurements describing hydrologic fluctuations. Stream gages are a common measurement tool used to better understand flow and inundation dynamics, but gage networks are incomplete or non-existent in many parts of the world. In such instances, satellite imagery may provide the only data available to monitor surface water changes over time. Here, we describe an effort to extend the applicability of the USGS Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) model to non-US regions. We leverage the multi-decadal archive of the Landsat satellite in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based computing platform to produce and analyze 372 monthly composite maps and 31 annual maps (January 1988-December 2018) in Cambodia, a flood-prone country in Southeast Asia that lacks a comprehensive stream gage network. DSWE relies on a series of spectral water indices and elevation data to classify water into four categories of water inundation. We compared model outputs to existing surface water maps and independently assessed DSWE accuracy at discrete dates across the time series. Despite considerable cloud obstruction and missing imagery across the monthly time series, the overall accuracy exceeded 85% for all annual tests. The DSWE model consistently mapped open water with high accuracy, and areas classified as "high confidence" water correlate well to other available maps at the country scale. Results in Cambodia suggest that extending DSWE globally using a cloud computing framework may benefit scientists, managers, and planners in a wide array of applications across the globe.

TI  - Environmental worldviews of Serbian and Macedonian school students
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to assess the dimensionality of the revised New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale in Serbian and Macedonian culture, and to use it to explore the environmental worldviews of young people in Serbia and the Republic of North Macedonia. A total of 850 pupils aged between 13 and 15 from 11 schools (5 elementary schools and 6 secondary schools) took part in this research. The dataset obtained from the scale was analysed via the principal component analysis factor extraction method, and a varimax rotation was applied. This study found all items load on four dimensions: Balance of Nature, Humans over Nature, Limits to Growth and Environmental Philosophy. Differences between subgroups occur in three out of four dimensions. The students' environmental worldviews were determined by providing the frequency distribution of their responses. Both subgroups in the Republic of North Macedonia and Serbia are (slightly) environmentally conscious, with an ecological view of the environment. Macedonian school students have a slightly higher NEP score than their peers in Serbia, indicating more environmentally protective attitudes among them. The participants did not see the two paradigms as mutually exclusive, as do members of some industrialised societies. The rejection of the Dominant Social Paradigm (DSP) by the NEP is a phenomenon that could well only be present in Western societies, whereas in less industrialised societies, the NEP and DSP could coexist in a comprehensive environmental view. With minor alterations such as word substitutions to facilitate easy comprehension of items by the respondents, the revised NEP scale will show more universal applicability outside developed communities.

TI  - A Random Forest Approach to Estimate Daily Particulate Matter, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Ozone at Fine Spatial Resolution in Sweden
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. An accurate assessment of its spatial and temporal distribution is mandatory to conduct epidemiological studies able to estimate long-term (e.g., annual) and short-term (e.g., daily) health effects. While spatiotemporal models for particulate matter (PM) have been developed in several countries, estimates of daily nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) concentrations at high spatial resolution are lacking, and no such models have been developed in Sweden. We collected data on daily air pollutant concentrations from routine monitoring networks over the period 2005-2016 and matched them with satellite data, dispersion models, meteorological parameters, and land-use variables. We developed a machine-learning approach, the random forest (RF), to estimate daily concentrations of PM10 (PM<10 microns), PM2.5 (PM<2.5 microns), PM2.5-10 (PM between 2.5 and 10 microns), NO2, and O-3 for each squared kilometer of Sweden over the period 2005-2016. Our models were able to describe between 64% (PM10) and 78% (O-3) of air pollutant variability in held-out observations, and between 37% (NO2) and 61% (O-3) in held-out monitors, with no major differences across years and seasons and better performance in larger cities such as Stockholm. These estimates will allow to investigate air pollution effects across the whole of Sweden, including suburban and rural areas, previously neglected by epidemiological investigations.

T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the intertextual relationship between a cluster of texts by three South African authors from three generations: a collection of children's stories, Stories van Rivierplaas ["Stories of River Farm"] (1955-6) by Alba Bouwer, Diepe Grond ["Deep Ground"] (1985) a play by Reza de Wet as well as De Wets own English translation and reworking of Diepe Grond as African Gothic (2003), and Eersgeborene ["Firstborn"] (2009) a short film by Etienne Kallos. While between the three authors, it is only Bouwer 's work that can be classified as children's fiction, De Wet and Kallos not only adapt and appropriate her texts but also thematise childhood in theirs. To discuss Bouwer, De Wet and Kallos's critique of normative constructions of aged subjectivity, I draw on Maria Nikolajeva's concept "aetonormativity", an age based norm and the specific assumption that adults and adult experiences are normative while the experiences of a child should be classified as deviant (2010:8). As such I read aetonormativity as a kind of performativity as Judith Butler defines it, that is, a subject position which is posited by means ofsocial mechanisms as an ontological essence, while there are no universal consensus or proof of its reality (1999:viii).Narrowly defined definitions of maturity are exposed in various ways in the works of Bouwer, De Wet and Kallos. The narrative mode in Stories van Rivierplaas is heterodiegetic, but the plot and chronotope are still focalised by way offree-indirect discourse, through the point of view of the child protagonist, Alie. Consequently, the child's field of experience and worldview serve as the text's epistemological basis and the normative adult voices of her parents and other authority figures are subordinated to her own rhapsodic and sensual conceptions of life.In De Wets adaptation of Stories van Rivierplaas, Diepe Grond, she intensifies this worldview by depicting Bouwer 's child characters as grownups who entirely reject their parents 'exemplary codes of conduct by still behaving and speaking like children and only act as adults when they parody their parents, subversively. In this way their parents' expression of maturity is reduced to personae in the etymological Latin origin of the word: theatre masks. De Wet theatricalises the Afrikaner nationalist aetonormativity that Bouwer questions by means of metatheatre: De Wet Alie is an adult, but she acts like a child who imitates adults from time to time.Twenty years after Diepe Grond's premiere De Wet translates and rewrites it as African Gothic. In this version she emphasises, by means of changes in the plot and altered narrative strategies, the stealthy and violent ways with which some women empower themselves within a system that rob them of equal agency. De Wet portrays the child again as the neglected, underestimated and masterful social actor who is able to copy the powerplay of adults and to beat them at their own game.In Eersgeborene Etienne Kallos takes the gender and sexual dimensions of the adults in Bouwer and De Wet's texts under closer scrutiny. The counterparts in Diepe Grond of Alie and Hennie in Rivierplaas, Soekie and Frikkie, and of Sussie and Frikkie in African Gothic become two sons, Kleinbasie and Frikkie. While Alie in Rivierplaas, Soekie in Diepe Grond and Sussie in African Gothic imitate a parent of the same gender, Kleinbasie cross-dresses as his mother, explicating the same performative dimensions of aeto- and gendernormativity. Eersgeborene also highlights the patronising and the pathological infantilisation of homosexuality by means of the mother characters description of it, in the film, as part of the "the things of a child".In line with the analysed texts' thematic preoccupation with childhood and parenthood the metaphor of motherhood is used to construct a genetic lens with which the texts are read as giving birth to each other, stressing as such their filial rather than embattled relationship.

TI  - The Role of Sea Surface Temperature Forcing in the Life-Cycle of Mediterranean Cyclones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air-sea interface processes are highly associated with the evolution and intensity of marine-developed storms. Specifically, in the Mediterranean Sea, the air-ocean temperature deviations have a profound role during the several stages of Mediterranean cyclonic events. Subsequently, this enhances the need for better knowledge and representation of the sea surface temperature (SST). In this work, an analysis of the impact and uncertainty of the SST from different well-known datasets on the life-cycle of Mediterranean cyclones is attempted. Daily SST from the Real Time Global SST (RTG_SST) and hourly SST fields from the Operational SST and Sea Ice Ocean Analysis (OSTIA) and the NEMO ocean circulation model are implemented in the RAMS/ICLAMS-WAM coupled modeling system. For the needs of the study, the Mediterranean cyclones Trixi, Numa, and Zorbas were selected. Numerical experiments covered all stages of their life-cycles (five to seven days). Model results have been analyzed in terms of storm tracks and intensities, cyclonic structural characteristics, and derived heat fluxes. Remote sensing data from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals (IMERG) for Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM), Blended Sea Winds, and JASON altimetry missions were employed for a qualitative and quantitative comparison of modeled results in precipitation, maximum surface wind speed, and wave height. Spatiotemporal deviations in the SST forcing rather than significant differences in the maximum/minimum SST values, seem to mainly contribute to the differences between the model results. Considerable deviations emerged in the resulting heat fluxes, while the most important differences were found in precipitation exhibiting spatial and intensity variations reaching 100 mm. The employment of widely used products is shown to result in different outcomes and this point should be taken into consideration in forecasting and early warning systems.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo establish the bilateral pelvic concordance rate of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and determine the likelihood of lymph node metastasis in cases of mapping failure.MethodsA database analysis was performed on 414 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer who underwent SLN mapping followed by robotic hysterectomy and completion pelvic (n=414, 100%) and aortic (n=186, 44.9%) lymphadenectomy from March 2011 to August 2016. Stage, histology, SLN sites, and surgico-pathologic findings were analyzed. The bilateral concordance rate of SLN location, successful unilateral and bilateral mapping rates, false negative rate, and non-SLN metastasis associated with mapping failure were calculated.ResultsHistologies included 354 (85.5%) endometrioid, 39 (9.4%) serous, 16 (3.9%) carcinosarcoma, 4 (1.0%) clear cell, and 1 (0.2%) undifferentiated. Final stages included 262 (63.3%) IA, 36 (8.7%) IB, 15 (3.6%) II, 6 (1.4%) IIIA, 68 (16.4%) IIIC1, and 27 (6.5%) IIIC2. Bilateral SLN mapping was successful in 355 (85.7%) patients, and 266 (74.9%) demonstrated mapping to the symmetrical lymphatic group contralaterally. The mapping failure rate was 13.5% (56/414) unilaterally and 0.7% (3/414) bilaterally. SLN locations were external iliac (69.1%), obturator (25.1%), internal iliac (2.2%), common iliac (1.9%), pre-sacral (0.9%), aortic (0.4%), parametrial (0.3%), and para-rectal (0.1%). Lymph node metastases were identified in 95 (22.9%) pelvic and 27 (6.5%) aortic nodes. 10 (16.9%) cases with mapping failure had lymph node metastasis on completion lymphadenectomy, similar to the proportion of SLNs with metastases (p=0.35). However, macro-metastases were more common in mapping failure completion lymphadenectomies than in the positive SLNs (80% vs 22.3%, p<0.001).ConclusionThe contralateral SLN location concordance rate was 75%. Most SLNs were along the medial external iliac or obturator locations. The rate of positive lymph nodes associated with SLN mapping failure was 16.9%, similar to the overall node-positive rate. The detection of pelvic node metastasis with SLN mapping failure was largely populated with macro-metastases and confirms the necessity of completion lymphadenectomy with mapping failure.

TI  - Assessment of Mitigation Strategies for Tropospheric Phase Contributions to InSAR Time-Series Datasets over Two Nicaraguan Volcanoes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) studies of ground displacement are often plagued by tropospheric artifacts, which are phase delays resulting from spatiotemporal variations in the refractivity of air within the troposphere. In this study, we focus on COSMO-SkyMed (X-band) InSAR products obtained over two different types of volcanoes in Nicaragua: the Telica stratovolcano and the Masaya caldera. We examine the applicability of an empirical linear correction method and three Global Weather Models (GWMs) with different spatial and temporal resolutions for removing the tropospheric phase component. We linearly invert the tropospheric-corrected interferograms using the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) time-series technique to produce time-series of ground displacement. Statistical assessments were performed on the corrected interferograms to examine the significance of the applied corrections on the individual interferograms and time-series results. We find that the applicability of the correction methods is highly case-dependent and that in general, the temporal resolution of GWMs influences their ability to capture turbulent tropospheric phase delays. At the two target volcanoes, our study shows that none of the GWMs are able to accurately capture the tropospheric phase delays. Our study provides a guide for researchers using InSAR data in tropical regions who wish to use tropospheric model corrections to carefully assess the applicability of the different types of tropospheric correction methods.

TI  - Influence of selected habitat and stand factors on bark beetle <i>Ips typographus</i> (L.) outbreak in the Bialowieza Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is one of the most critical insect disturbance agents in Europe. In recent years, bark beetles have caused tremendous economic losses, and affected ecosystems over large spatial scales. In this study, we evaluated the influence of selected factors on the bark beetle outbreak in 2015, the year with the most severe drought to have been recorded in the last few decades. The main aim of this study was to develop a new approach of identifying and mapping individual trees infested by bark beetles, for more efficient bark beetle management. The study was conducted on an area occupying 62,000 ha, using air-borne laser scanning, multispectral imagery data, and digital forest maps.First, an individual dead tree detection method, based on remote sensing data, was developed, which allowed the quantification of the bark beetle outbreak at an individual tree level, with accurate information on the number and location of killed spruces. Then, topography, habitat, and single tree-based variables were used to examine their influence on tree mortality. Finally, a spatial hot-spot analysis of the outbreak, throughout the 62,000 ha of the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest, was performed.For the first time, we mapped the status of the spruce bark beetle outbreak across the Bialowieza Forest, using the method developed in this study. 283,166 dead Norway spruce trees were detected in the study area, supporting the fact that the current bark beetle outbreak is the largest in this area since 1945. The number of dead spruces surrounding any given dead tree was the single most important predictor in all models, with a relative contribution of 35-79% depending on the neighbourhood analysed (radius from 0 to 2000 m). Crown closure and stand age, as well as the share of dead spruce and dominant tree species were found to be the most important predictors of the development of bark beetle infestation. The method developed in this study was evaluated and proved to be suitable for the monitoring and management of the ongoing insect outbreak.

TI  - Implementation of a sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm for endometrial cancer: surgical outcomes and hospital charges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to compare operative times, surgical outcomes, resource utilization, and hospital charges before and after the implementation of a sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm in endometrial cancer.MethodsAll patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were identified pre- (2012) and post- (2017) implementation of the SLN algorithm. Clinical data were summarized and compared between groups. Total hospital charges incurred on the day of surgery were extracted from the hospital financial system for each patient and all charges were adjusted to 2017 US dollars.ResultsA total of 203 patients were included: 71 patients in 2012 and 130 patients in 2017. There was no difference in median age, body mass index, or stage. In 2012, 35/71 patients (49.3%) underwent a lymphadenectomy. In 2017, SLN mapping was attempted in 120/130 patients (92.3%) and at least one SLN was identified in 110/120 (91.7%). Median estimated blood loss was similar between groups (100 mL vs 75 mL, p=0.081). There was a significant decrease in both median operative time (210 vs 171 min, p=0.007) and utilization of intraoperative frozen section (63.4% vs 14.6%, p<0.0001). No significant differences were noted in intraoperative (p=1.00) or 30 day postoperative complication rates (p=0.30). The median total hospital charges decreased by 2.73% in 2017 as compared with 2012 (p=0.96).DiscussionImplementation of an SLN mapping algorithm for high- and low-risk endometrial cancer resulted in a decrease in both operative time and intraoperative frozen section utilization with no change in surgical morbidity. While hospital charges did not significantly change, further studies are warranted to assess the true cost of SLN mapping.

TI  - European interdisciplinary guideline on invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: Part 1. epidemiology, diagnostics and prevention
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most common cancers in the white populations, accounting for 20% of all cutaneous malignancies. Factors implicated in cSCC etiopathogenesis include ultraviolet radiation exposure and chronic photoaging, age, male sex, immunosuppression, smoking and genetic factors. A collaboration of multidisciplinary experts from the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO) and the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to update recommendations on cSCC classification, diagnosis, risk stratification, staging and prevention, based on current literature, staging systems and expert consensus. Common cSCCs are typically indolent tumors, and most have a good prognosis with 5-year cure rates of greater than 90%, and a low rate of metastases (<4%). Further risk stratification into low-risk or high-risk common primary cSCC is recommended based on proposed high-risk factors. Advanced cSCC is classified as locally advanced (lacSCC), and metastatic (mcSCC) including locoregional metastatic or distant metastatic cSCC. Current systems used for staging include the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 8th edition, and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) system. Physical examination for all cSCCs should include total body skin examination and clinical palpation of lymph nodes, especially of the draining basins. Radiologic imaging such as ultrasound of the regional lymph nodes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans are recommended for staging of high-risk cSCC. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is currently not recommended. Nicotinamide, oral retinoids, and topical 5-FU have been used for the chemoprevention of subsequent cSCCs in high-risk patients but are not routinely recommended. Education about sun protection measures including reducing sun exposure, use of protective clothing, regular use of sunscreens and avoidance of artificial tanning, is recommended.

TI  - Modeling the Spatial Distribution of Swordfish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>) Using Fishery and Remote Sensing Data: Approach and Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Swordfish, Xiphias gladius (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially important species that is widely distributed throughout three oceans. This species inhabits oceanic waters with preferred environmental ranges and migrates vertically to the surface layer for feeding. However, the spatial distribution pattern and habitat preferences of swordfish have been rarely studied in the Pacific Ocean due to the wide geographic range of this species. This study examined the spatial distribution and preferred ranges of environmental variables for swordfish using two approaches, generalized additive models and habitat suitability index methods, with different spatio-temporal data resolution scales. Results indicated that sea surface temperature is the most important factor determining swordfish spatial distribution. Habitat spatial pattern and preferred environmental ranges, estimated using various modeling approaches, were robust relative to the spatio-temporal data resolution scales. The models were validated by examining the consistency between predictions and untrained actual observations, which all predicted a high relative density of swordfish in the tropical waters of the central Pacific Ocean, with no obvious seasonal movement. Results from this study, based on fishery and remote sensing data with wide spatial coverage, could benefit the conservation and management of fisheries for highly migratory species such as swordfish and tuna.

TI  - Habitat-partitioning improves regional distribution models in multi-habitat species: a case study with the European bilberry
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling the spatial distribution of multi-habitat species is challenging since they show multi-dimensional environmental responses that may vary sharply through habitats. Hence, for these species, the achievement of realistic models useful in conservation planning may depend on the appropriate consideration of habitat information in model calibration. We aimed to evaluate the role of different types of habitat predictors, along with habitat-partitioning, to improve model inference, detect non-stationary responses across habitats and simulate the impact of sampling bias on spatial predictions. As a case study, we modelled the occurrence of the multi-habitat plant species bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) in the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain), where it represents a basic trophic resource for threatened brown bear and capercaillie. We used MaxEnt to compare a baseline model approach calibrated with topo-climatic variables against three alternative approaches using explicit habitat information based on vegetation maps and remote sensing data. For each approach, we ran non-partitioned (all habitats together) and habitat-partitioned models (one per habitat) and evaluated model performance, overfitting and extrapolation. The highest performance was for habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors. The lowest overfitting was for the baseline non-partitioned model, at the cost of achieving the highest predicted fractional area. The extrapolation success of habitat-partitioned models was low, with the highest performance for the baseline approach. Our results highlight that multi-habitat species responses are non-stationary across habitats, with habitat-biased data resulting in weak spatial predictions. When modelling the distribution of multi-habitat species at regional scale, we recommend using habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors, either vegetation maps or remote sensing data, to improve the realism of spatial outputs and its applicability in regional conservation planning.

TI  - DSCALE_mod16: A Model for Disaggregating Microwave Satellite Soil Moisture with Land Surface Evapotranspiration Products and Gridded Meteorological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the spatial resolution of microwave satellite soil moisture (SM) products is important for various applications. Most of the downscaling methods that fuse optical/thermal and microwave data rely on remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) or LST-derived SM indexes (SMIs). However, these methods suffer from the problems of "cloud contamination", "decomposing uncertainty", and "decoupling effect". This study presents a new downscaling method, referred to as DSCALE_mod16, without using LST and LST-derived SMIs. This model combines MODIS ET products and a gridded meteorological data set to obtain Land surface Evaporative Efficiency (LEE) as the main downscaling factor. A cosine-square form of downscaling function was adopted to represent the quantitative relationship between LEE and SM. Taking the central part of the United States as the case study area, we downscaled SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) SM products with an original resolution of 36km to a resolution of 500m. The study period spans more than three years from 2015 to 2018. In situ SM measurements from three sparse networks and three core validation sites (CVS) were used to evaluate the downscaling model. The evaluation results indicate that the downscaled SM values maintain the spatial dynamic range of original SM data while providing more spatial details. Moreover, the moisture mass is conserved during the downscaling process. The downscaled SM values have a good agreement with in situ SM measurements. The unbiased root-mean-square errors (ubRMSEs) of downscaled SM values is 0.035 m(3)/m(3) at Fort Cobb, 0.026 m(3)/m(3) at Little Washita, and 0.055 m(3)/m(3) at South Fork, which are comparable to ubRMSEs of original SM estimates at these three CVS.

TI  - A metaheuristic framework based automated Spatial-Spectral graph for land cover classification from multispectral and hyperspectral satellite images
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of satellite images has been a very predominant area since the last few years. An increase in the amount of information acquired by satellite imaging systems, urges the need for automatic tools for classification. Satellite images exhibit spatial and/or temporal dependencies in which the conventional machine learning algorithms fail to perform well. In this paper, we propose an improved framework for automated land cover classification using Spatial Spectral Schroedinger Eigenmaps (SSSE) optimized by Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted for the final thematic map generation following dimensionally reduction and clustering by the proposed approach. The novelty of the proposed framework is that the applicability of optimized SSSE for land cover classification of medium and high resolution multi-spectral satellite images is tested for the first time. The proposed method makes land cover classification system fully automatic by optimizing the algorithm specific image dependent parameter a using CS algorithm. Experiments are carried out over publicly available high and medium resolution multi-spectral satellite image datasets (Landsat 5 TM and IKONOS 2 MS) and hyper-spectral satellite image datasets (Pavia University and Indian Pines) to assess the robustness of the proposed approach. Performance comparisons of the proposed method against state-of-the-art multi-spectral and hyper-spectral land cover classification methods reveal the efficiency of the proposed method.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the industrialized world, the most common cause of secondary lymphedema is iatrogenic. The inciting event is generally a combination of lymph node resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Although a regional nodal dissection is often the primary risk factor, lymphedema can also result from sentinel node dissections, or as in the case presented without any surgical resection. Here, we present a unique case of upper extremity lymphedema resulting from definitive chemoradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The patient was treated using a combined approach with a lymphaticovenular anastomosis and a free vascularized inguinal lymph node transfer.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil organic carbon using ensemble learning model in Mollisols of Hyrcanian forests, northern Iran
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This studywas conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the ensemblemachine learning model to predict the spatial variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in a deciduous forest ecosystemin northern Iran. To do this, a total of 153 soil samples by applying regular systematic sampling grid at two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were collected. Two scenarios through digital soil mapping (DSM) were considered to establish the predictive models for estimating SOC including (i) combination of selected topographic attributers (T), remotely sensed data (R), and soil properties (S) (TRS) and (ii) combination of topographic attributes and remotely sensed data (TR). The ensemblemodel for predicting of SOCwas consisted of sixmachine learning algorithms: partial least squares regression (PLSR), generalized linear model (GLM), recursive partitioning and regression trees (rpart), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN). The 10-fold cross-validation with three replications was employed to evaluate the performance of models by root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The results showed that SOC was varied from 2.05 to 13.16% with a mean of 5.67% in first depth (0-10 cm) and from 1.56 to 9.56% with a mean of 3.99% in second depth (10-20 cm). According to the RMSE and R-2 results ensemble machine learning model, first scenario (TRS) showed higher performance (higher R-2 and lower RMSE) than second scenario (TR) for prediction of SOC in first depth (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE= 0.78%) and second depth (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.90%). Also, in the best scenario (TRS) for individual models, results of validation revealed that GLM, SVM and RF for the first depth and PLSR, GLM, SVM, and RF for the second depthwere themost accuratemachine learning algorithms in ensemblemodeling based on RMSE. Our finding indicated that soil properties had an important contribution to the spatial variability of SOC in the studied forest soil. Moreover, topographic attributes and vegetation indexes were found to be auxiliary attributes in the modeling of SOC and could use for quick and cost-effective assessment of SOC concentration in order to management practices in forest soils.

TI  - Assessment of forest health status using a forest fragmentation approach: a study in Patharia Hills Reserve Forest, northeast India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Diverse anthropogenic pressure has led to land use change in the form of decline of vegetation and fragmented habitats. With rising anthropogenic threats, many species are restricted to fragmented and degraded habitats and declining biodiversity. The aim of the study was to understand the forest health status in Patharia Hills Reserve Forest (RF) using land use land cover (LULC) trajectories along with forest cover and fragmentation approach. Landsat TM and OLI images for three particular days of each of the year 1988, 1997 and 2016 were used to assess spatio-temporal variation in forest cover. Fragmentation model was used to examine the patterns of forest fragmentation in the Patharia Hills RF during the study period. The results indicated an overall increase in forest cover (10.52%) along with rise in human settlements and agriculture, while decrease in grasslands between 1988 and 2016. However, the fragmentation analysis revealed that the health of the RF has been deteriorating. Increasing edge effects with declining core areas were the prime indicators of disturbances on the forest. The eastern border of the RF is under tremendous influence of anthropogenic activities and most of the land use land cover change was observed in that side. Human settlements, agriculture, and developmental activities were main contributors to forest fragmentation at that side of the RF, while better protection at the international border area was the major factor to increase forested areas at the western part of the RF. Forest fragmentation has a large impact on biodiversity and increase risks for survival for many species, especially primate and the migratory elephant would suffer more in the study area. Fragmentation habitats would lead to increasing Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). To control the habitat fragmentation, proper management strategies should be prepared which include afforestation in the perforated areas, reduce anthropogenic pressures, and demarcate the RF for its better protection.

AB  - Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter is a method of local polynomial regression, and iterative filtering with S-G filter can be used to smooth out random noise and outliers of cloud noise in NDVI time series. It involves a continuous approximation to the upper envelope of NDVI time series. In this paper, the optimum-length of S-G filter was estimated based on Steinc's unbiased risk estimator theory when S-G filtering was conducted iteratively, and the reconstruction result was presented. Reconstruction experiments on the simulated data and MODIS NDVI time series of the year 2010-2014 showed that the optimum-length S-G filter can outperform the fixed bandwidth S-G filter.

TI  - Estimation of Crop Growth Parameters Using UAV-Based Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) and the leaf area index (LAI) are important indicators for the assessment of crop growth, and are therefore important for agricultural management. Although improvements have been made in the monitoring of crop growth parameters using ground- and satellite-based sensors, the application of these technologies is limited by imaging difficulties, complex data processing, and low spatial resolution. Therefore, this study evaluated the use of hyperspectral indices, red-edge parameters, and their combination to estimate and map the distributions of AGB and LAI for various growth stages of winter wheat. A hyperspectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle was used to obtain vegetation indices and red-edge parameters, and stepwise regression (SWR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods were used to accurately estimate the AGB and LAI based on these vegetation indices, red-edge parameters, and their combination. The results show that: (i) most of the studied vegetation indices and red-edge parameters are significantly highly correlated with AGB and LAI; (ii) overall, the correlations between vegetation indices and AGB and LAI, respectively, are stronger than those between red-edge parameters and AGB and LAI, respectively; (iii) Compared with the estimations using only vegetation indices or red-edge parameters, the estimation of AGB and LAI using a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters is more accurate; and (iv) The estimations of AGB and LAI obtained using the PLSR method are superior to those obtained using the SWR method. Therefore, combining vegetation indices with red-edge parameters and using the PLSR method can improve the estimation of AGB and LAI.

TI  - Retrieval of Reflection Coefficients of the Earth's Surface from MODIS Satellite Measurements Considering Radiation Polarization
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm is considered for retrieving the reflection coefficients of the Earth's surface taking into account radiation polarization. The algorithm was tested for five MODIS channels in three areas: south of Tomsk region, Moscow region, and Irkutsk region. Test points at the center of coniferous forest massifs in the summer season were used to estimate the error of the algorithm. Results from our algorithm with and without accounting for polarization, from the MOD09 algorithm, and results without atmospheric correction were compared with measurements taken as reference. The comparison shows that the average values obtained by our algorithm taking into account polarization are closer to the reference data than those obtained using the MOD09 NASA algorithm in MODIS channels 1 (0.620-0.670 mu m), 3 (0.459-0.479 mu m), and 4 (0.545-0.565 mu m), and the difference on the same order of magnitude is observed in MODIS channel 2 (0.841-0.876 mu m). In MODIS channel 8 (0.405-0.420 mu m), one algorithm is preferable in some situations and the other otherwise.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early stage endometrial cancer: a Turkish gynecologic oncology group study (TRSGO-SLN-001)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in clinically uterine confined endometrial cancer.MethodsPatients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial cancer with an SLN algorithm were reviewed. Indocyanine green or blue dye was used as a tracer. SLNs and/or suspicious lymph nodes were resected. Side specific lymphadenectomy was performed when mapping was unsuccessful. SLNs were ultrastaged on final pathology.Results357 eligible patients were analyzed. Median age was 59 years. Median number of resected SLNs was 2 (range 1-12) per patient. Minimal invasive and open surgeries were performed in 264 (73.9%) and 93 (26.1%) patients, respectively. Indocyanine green was used in 231 (64.7%) and blue dye in 126 (35.3%) patients. The dyes were injected into the cervix in 355 (99.4%) patients. The overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 91.9% and 71.4%, respectively. The mapping rates using indocyanine green or blue dye were comparable (P=0.526). There were 43 (12%) patients with lymphatic metastasis. The SLN algorithm was not able to detect 3 of 43 patients who had isolated paraaortic metastasis. After SLN biopsy, complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 286 (80.1%) patients. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were both 100% for the detection of pelvic lymph node metastases. In addition, 117 (32.8%) patients underwent completion paraaortic lymphadenectomy after SLN biopsy. In these patients, sensitivity for detecting metastases to pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph nodes was 90.3% with a negative predictive value of 96.6%. The risk of non-SLN involvement in patients with macrometastatic SLNs, micrometastatic SLNs, and isolated tumor cells in SLNs were 61.2%, 14.3% and 0%, respectively.ConclusionsSLN biopsy had good accuracy in detecting lymphatic metastasis. However, one-third of cases with metastatic SLNs also had non-SLN involvement and this risk increased to two-thirds of cases with macrometastatic SLNs. The effect of leaving these nodes in situ on survival should be evaluated in further studies.

TI  - Parched pines: a quantitative comparison of two multi-year droughts and associated mass mortalities of bishop pine (<i>Pinus muricata</i>) on Santa Cruz Island, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events such as droughts are expected to increase in severity and frequency as the climate changes; it is imperative that land managers be able to monitor associated changes in vegetation health efficiently and across large scales in order to mitigate or prepare for these events. This need motivated deeper study of the die-off of bishop pine (Pinus muricata) on California's Santa Cruz Island during the 2012-2016 drought. These pines play a keystone role within the island's ecosystem and have experienced two severe droughts and associated mass die-offs in the past 40 years. In an effort to compare these events, we used meteorological data to track changes in drought severity from 1985 to 2018 coupled with novel methods for forest monitoring to reveal dynamics not detectable by shorter-duration studies. Leveraging 34 years of 30 m resolution Landsat imagery, we compared vegetation mortality between the two most severe droughts of that time period: 1987-1991 and 2012-2016. We used the slope of decline in the annual median value of three different Vegetation Indices (VIs; NBR, NDMI and NDVI) to compare mortality between the two drought events and to reveal spatial patterns of mortality within the bishop pine forests. Our results indicated that the 2012-2016 drought was the island's harshest in over a century and that it resulted in greater and more widespread mortality of vegetation within bishop pine stands than the 1987-1991 drought. The average VI decline was significantly greater during the 2012-2016 drought than the 1987-1991 drought by a factor of 1.89, 2.09 and 1.84 for NBR, NDMI and NDVI, respectively. Our results aligned with projections of increasing drought severity and associated tree mortality across the region. The temporal monitoring methods developed here can be adapted to study similar landscape scale changes over multiple decades in other forest ecosystems facing similar threats.

TI  - Eigenvalue-Based Approaches for Solving an Ill-Posed Problem Arising in Sensor Orientation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensor orientation is an essential step for georeferencing of images, establishing the coordinate transformation between the image and ground spaces. This orientation is mainly carried out by the sensor dependent or independent models, and the desired georeferencing accuracy is achieved with the adjusted orientation elements using ancillary data. Independently of the orientation model, an ill-posed problem is occurred in the adjustment process, caused by the ill-conditioned Jacobian matrix which is differentiated through the orientation elements. However, this challenge is mitigated by various approaches such as regularization, matrix inversion, or elimination methods. In this work, three different types of orientation models were exposed on Zonguldak test site characterizing mountainous urban and dense forest areas: 1) sensor-dependent orientation model for handling of SPOT 5 HRG panchromatic stereo images and 2) sensor-dependent and 3) sensor-independent rational function model (RFM) for Pleiades 1A and SPOT 6 panchromatic mono images. The main finding of this work is that eigenvalue-based approaches, i.e., Tikhonov regularization using eigenvalue and Moore-Penrose (pseudo) inversing, provide the best numerical solutions among the approaches initially investigated by the authors. The novelty of this article is that two eigenvalue-based approaches investigated in this article are never preferred to solve ill-posed problem in different sensor orientation cases.

TI  - New Approaches for the Assimilation of LAI Measurements into a Crop Model Ensemble to Improve Wheat Biomass Estimations
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of LAI measurements, repeatedly taken at sub-field level, into dynamic crop simulation models could provide valuable information for precision farming applications. Commonly used updating methods such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) rely on an ensemble of model runs to update a limited set of state variables every time a new observation becomes available. This threatens the model's integrity, as not the entire table of model states is updated. In this study, we present the Weighted Mean (WM) approach that relies on a model ensemble that runs from simulation start to simulation end without compromising the consistency and integrity of the state variables. We measured LAI on 14 winter wheat fields across France, Germany and the Netherlands and assimilated these observations into the LINTUL5 crop model using the EnKF and WM approaches, where the ensembles were created using one set of crop component (CC) ensemble generation variables and one set of soil and crop component (SCC) ensemble generation variables. The model predictions for total aboveground biomass and grain yield at harvest were evaluated against measurements collected in the fields. Our findings showed that (a) the performance of the WM approach was very similar to the EnKF approach when SCC variables were used for the ensemble generation, but outperformed the EnKF approach when only CC variables were considered, (b) the difference in site-specific performance largely depended on the choice of the set of ensemble generation variables, with SCC outperforming CC with regard to both biomass and grain yield, and (c) both EnKF and WM improved accuracy of biomass and yield estimates over standard model runs or the ensemble mean. We conclude that the WM data assimilation approach is equally efficient to the improvement of model accuracy, compared to the updating methods, but it has the advantage that it does not compromise the integrity and consistency of the state variables.

TI  - How Do Methods Assimilating Sentinel-2-Derived LAI Combined with Two Different Sources of Soil Input Data Affect the Crop Model-Based Estimation of Wheat Biomass at Sub-Field Level?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of Sentinel-2 derived information about sub-field heterogeneity of crop canopy leaf area index (LAI) and SoilGrids-derived information about local soil properties might help to improve the prediction accuracy of crop simulation models at sub-field level without prior knowledge of detailed site characteristics. In this study, we ran a crop model using either soil texture derived from samples that were taken spatially distributed across a field and analyzed in the lab (AS) or SoilGrids-derived soil texture (SG) as model input in combination with different levels of LAI assimilation. We relied on the LINTUL5 model implemented in the SIMPLACE modeling framework to simulate winter wheat biomass development in 40 to 60 points in each field with detailed measured soil information available, for 14 fields across France, Germany, and the Netherlands during two growing seasons. Water stress was the only growth-limiting factor considered in the model. The model performance was evaluated against total aboveground biomass measurements at harvest with regard to the average per-field prediction and the simulated spatial variability within the field. Our findings showed that a) per-field average biomass predictions of SG-based modeling approaches were not inferior to those using AS-texture as input, but came with a greater prediction uncertainty, b) relying on the generation of an ensemble without LAI assimilation might produce results as accurate as simulations where LAI is assimilated, and c) sub-field heterogeneity was not reproduced well in any of the fields, predominantly because of an inaccurate simulation of water stress in the model. We conclude that research should be devoted to the testing of different approaches to simulate soil moisture dynamics and to the testing in other sites, potentially using LAI products derived from other remotely sensed imagery.

TI  - From the Bottom Up: Assessing the Spectral Ability of Common Multispectral Sensors to Detect Surface Archaeological Deposits Using Field Spectrometry and Advanced Classifiers in the Shashi-Limpopo Confluence Area
T2  - AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the ability of six common multispectral sensors (GeoEye, Landsat 8 OLI, RapidEye, Sentinel-2, SPOT 5, and WorldView-2) to map archaeological sites typically inhabited by the farming communities of Southern Africa and characterized by surface features such as middens, non-vitrified dung, and vitrified dung. To achieve this, hyperspectral data collected in the field using a GER-1500 field spectroradiometer were resampled to the spectral resolutions of the selected sensors using the spectral library resampling tool in ENVI. Mean decrease in accuracy was used to assess the importance of both hyperspectral wavelengths and each band allocated to a multispectral sensor in discriminating the selected archaeological classes. Two predictive models based on the resampled hyperspectral data were developed in R using algorithms for support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The results demonstrate that data resampled to the resolution of common multispectral sensors have the ability to predict surface archaeological features using RF and SVM classifiers. Important bands for predicting sites are mostly in the visible and shortwave infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The best performance was achieved with data resampled to the resolution of the Sentinel-2 sensor, which attained 81.90% and 92.38% accuracy in both RF and SVM classifiers respectively. The predictions indicate the relevance of field spectroscopy studies to better understand the spectral models critical for archaeological sites detection.

AB  - Background Risk of contralateral nodal metastases in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is currently based on clinical risk factors. We propose lymphatic mapping with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) for tumor-specific delineation of lymphatic drainage to guide treatment.Methods Retrospective review of lymphatic drainage patterns in cT1-2 OPSCC and contralateral cN0 neck with a nonoperative, awake injection of 99 m-Tc sulfur colloid and SPECT-CT.Results Ten patients were reviewed. Primary sites included tonsil (n = 8, 80%) and tongue base (n = 2, 20%). All patients tolerated awake injections with no complications. Nine patients (90%) demonstrated satisfactory migration of radiotracer to neck node(s) with seven (78%) to the ipsilateral lateral neck, one (11%) to the ipsilateral lateral neck and retropharynx, and one (11%) to bilateral lateral neck nodes.Conclusions Characterization of lymphatic drainage in OPSCC is feasible using a nonoperative injection technique and SPECT-CT. Drainage to the contralateral neck is rare, warranting further study to tailor treatment appropriately.

TI  - Estimating Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass Using Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Trees Algorithm with Fused Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Data in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of gradient boosting decision trees techniques in estimating mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) at the Can Gio biosphere reserve (Vietnam). For this purpose, we employed a novel gradient-boosting regression technique called the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) algorithm implemented and verified a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 121 sampling plots conducted during the dry season. The dataset fuses the data of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and the dual polarimetric (HH, HV) data of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The performance standards of the proposed model (root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2)) were compared with those of other machine learning techniques, namely gradient boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forests regression (RFR). The XGBR model obtained a promising result with R-2 = 0.805, RMSE = 28.13 Mg ha(-1), and the model yielded the highest predictive performance among the five machine learning models. In the XGBR model, the estimated mangrove AGB ranged from 11 to 293 Mg ha(-1) (average = 106.93 Mg ha(-1)). This work demonstrates that XGBR with the combined Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data can accurately estimate the mangrove AGB in the Can Gio biosphere reserve. The general applicability of the XGBR model combined with multiple sourced optical and SAR data should be further tested and compared in a large-scale study of forest AGBs in different geographical and climatic ecosystems.

TI  - NEONOD 2: Rationale and design of a multicenter non-inferiority trial to assess the effect of axillary surgery omission on the outcome of breast cancer patients presenting only micrometastasis in the sentinel lymph node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone, without complete axillary lymph node dissection, is the standard treatment of the axilla nodal chain in early -stage breast cancer patients presenting a negative sentinel lymph node. The updated results of the IBCSG 23-01 randomized trial recently provided evidence that this approach could be extended to early -stage breast cancer patients presenting only micrometastasis in the sentinel lymph node.On the other hand, patients with large operable or locally advanced breast cancer and clinically positive lymph nodes currently receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which is then followed by complete axillary node dissection if the sentinel lymph node till contains tumor residue, regardless of the extent of nodal disease. Assuming that patients presenting only a micrometastatic sentinel lymph node after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy are clinically equivalent to the IBCSG 23-01 early-breast cancer patients with only micrometastatic sentinel node, then complete axillary dissection would be unneeded also in these subset of patients in the neoadjuvant setting. The multicenter uncontrolled non-inferiority trial NEONOD 2 we here present was designed to assess this hypothesis, i.e. whether or not omission of complete axillary nodal clearance worsens prognosis in patients with sentinel node resulting only micrometastatic after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Trends in Upper-Tropospheric Humidity: Expansion of the Subtropical Dry Zones?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subtropical dry zones, located in the Hadley cells' subsidence regions, strongly influence regional climate as well as outgoing longwave radiation. Changes in these dry zones could have significant impact on surface climate as well as on the atmospheric energy budget. This study investigates the behavior of upper-tropospheric dry zones in a changing climate, using the variable upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH), calculated from climate model experiment output as well as from radiances measured with satellite-based sensors. The global UTH distribution shows that dry zones form a belt in the subtropical winter hemisphere. In the summer hemisphere they concentrate over the eastern ocean basins, where the descent regions of the subtropical anticyclones are located. Recent studies with model and satellite data have found tendencies of increasing dryness at the poleward edges of the subtropical subsidence zones. However, UTH calculated from climate simulations with 25 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) shows these tendencies only for parts of the winter-hemispheric dry belts. In the summer hemisphere, even though differences exist between the simulations, UTH is increasing in most dry zones, particularly in the South and North Pacific Ocean. None of the summer dry zones is expanding in these simulations. Upper-tropospheric dry zones estimated from observational data do not show any robust signs of change since 1979. Apart from a weak drying tendency at the poleward edge of the southern winter-hemispheric dry belt in infrared measurements, nothing indicates that the subtropical dry belts have expanded poleward.

The determined area within agricultural associations is often subjective, expensive, labor intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the paddy rice areas in the Nile Delta using a new methodology based on satellite data. The rice areas could be classified with good results at the beginning of the 1st flooding period applying the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The temporal profiles of NDVI and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were investigated. The NDVI profiles of different targets were analyzed to differentiate between rice and other crops, but the results failed to distinguish between rice and other crops in all stages after full vegetation cover. However, the analyzed LST profiles indicated the discrimination capability between rice and other crops in all vegetation development stages. The accuracy was high as 97% and 74% for LST and NDVI, respectively. The LST-based classification indicated that the distributed rice fields throughout the study area were 32.7% of the total cultivated area. The accuracy of LST results had an advantage over NDVI.

TI  - Genomic and Phenotypic Variability in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Antimicrobial Susceptibility, England
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a global concern. Phylogenetic analyses resolve uncertainties regarding genetic relatedness of isolates with identical phenotypes and inform whether AMR is due to new mutations and clonal expansion or separate introductions by importation. We sequenced 1,277 isolates with associated epidemiologic and antimicrobial susceptibility data collected during 2013-2016 to investigate N. gonorrhoeae genomic variability in England. Comparing genetic markers and phenotypes for AMR, we identified 2 N. gonorrhoeae lineages with different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and 3 clusters with elevated MICs for ceftriaxone, varying mutations in the penA allele, and different epidemiologic characteristics. Our results indicate N. gonorrhoeae with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility emerged independently and multiple times in different sexual networks in England, through new mutation or recombination events and by importation. Monitoring and control for AMR in N. gonorrhoeae should cover the entire population affected, rather than focusing on specific risk groups or locations.

TI  - Defining the learning curve for successful staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial cancer among surgeons at an academic institution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is increasingly used in endometrial cancer staging; however, success of the technique is variable, and the learning curve needs to be better understood. Success is defined as identification of a SLN specimen containing nodal tissue in bilateral hemi-pelvises.ObjectiveTo assess the learning curve of surgeons at an academic institution in performing successful SLN mapping and biopsy during robotic staging for endometrial cancer.MethodsAfter institutional review board approval, patients who underwent staging with robotic SLN mapping using indocyanine green at a single academic program between July 2012 and December 2017 were identified. Demographic, pathologic, and surgical data were retrospectively collected from the medical records. Descriptive and comparative statistics were performed. Surgeon rates of successful bilateral SLN mapping and removal of lymphoid-containing SLN specimens were compared. A logistic model was used to analyze the probability of successful SLN mapping and removal of lymph node-containing tissue with increasing number of procedures performed.ResultsThree hundred and seventeen patients met the eligibility criteria. Most had early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer. A total of 194 (61%) patients had successful bilateral mapping. Among seven surgeons, a plateau in rates of successful bilateral mapping was achieved after 40 cases. No linear correlation was seen between the number of surgeries performed and the rate of removal of lymph node-containing tissue among surgeons. Each additional 10 procedures performed was associated with a 5% and an 11% increase in the odds of successful SLN mapping and removal of lymph node-containing tissue, respectively.DiscussionThe successful removal of lymph node-containing specimens appears to be a surgeon-specific phenomenon. The plateau of the learning curve for successful bilateral mapping seems to be reached at around 40 cases. These first 40 cases offer a time for auditing of individual rates of SLN mapping and removal to identify surgeons who may benefit from procedure-specific remediation.

TI  - Environmental Aftermath of the 2019 Stromboli Eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the July-August 2019 eruption-induced wildfires at the Stromboli island (Italy). The analysis of land cover (LC) and land use (LU) changes has been crucial to describe the environmental impacts concerning endemic vegetation loss, damages to agricultural heritage, and transformations to landscape patterns. Moreover, a survey was useful to collect eyewitness accounts aimed to define the LU and to obtain detailed information about eruption-induced damages. Detection of burnt areas was based on PLEIADES-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, and field surveys. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) allowed mapping areas impacted by fires. LC and LU classification involved the detection of new classes, following the environmental units of landscape, being the result of the intersection between CORINE Land Cover project (CLC) and local landscape patterns. The results of multi-temporal comparison show that fire-damaged areas amount to 39% of the total area of the island, mainly affecting agricultural and semi-natural vegetated areas, being composed by endemic Aeolian species and abandoned olive trees that were cultivated by exploiting terraces up to high altitudes. LC and LU analysis has shown the strong correlation between land use management, wildfire severity, and eruption-induced damages on the island.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Machine Learning techniques for acreage estimation of mango (<i>Mangifera</i> <i>indica</i>)
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mango (Mangifera indica) is the most important commercially grown fruit crop in India. Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are the major producers of mango. It covers around 42% total area accounting for 40% of total production in the country. Hence, development of reliable and timely estimates of area under mango at national level is essential for policymakers and planners for market planning and export. Earlier only survey technologies were used for area estimation which was a time consuming and laborious process. Modern space technology like remote sensing can be used as an alternative. Therefore, a study was carried out for acreage estimation of mango in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh using Sentinel 2 satellite data in the year 2017. Acreage estimation of mango was done after the preparation of land use and land cover map. Three supervised classification techniques, viz. Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used for land use and land cover map preparation. Support Vector Machine using three different kernel functions, viz. Radial Basis Function (RBF), Sigmoid kernel and Polynomial kernel were used to improve the classification accuracy. SVMRBF was found to be the best classification technique with overall accuracy of 94.44 and kappa coefficient 0.9218. The mango area obtained from the classified satellite image using SVMRBF was 9372.96 ha.

TI  - Gaming Vocabulary in the Middle Ob Dialects
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the vocabulary of children and youth games in the dialects of the Middle Ob region. This lexical group has a significant informational potential in terms of representing a traditional folk culture. The sources of the material are the published Tomsk dialect dictionaries and the Tomsk dialect corpus data. The article aims to characterize the gaming vocabulary content and to examine the motivational basis of some game terms, their connection with various dialect semantic fields. Gaming vocabulary includes names of games, names of participants, actions performed during games, equipment, and auxiliary tools. In total, more than 100 lexical units were analyzed. Among them, there are both common and dialect words. One of the most important, lexicographically represented and analyzed fragment of gaming vocabulary is actual names of games. The largest subgroup consists of names of active games with a large number of participants. Among them are common words (e.g., rucheek (thread the needle), pryatki (hide-and-seek), lapta, gorodki (skittles), zhmurki (blind Tom), gorelki (chase-and-catch)) with matches in dialects. Games with equipment are also quite common. As a rule, these are small objects of peasant life, or things that are part of the natural environment. Names of such games are the result of metonymic transfers. Most lexemes referring to games without an object have a verbal motivational basis, which indicates the main action performed by players. This verb is often present in the description of the rules or in the gameplay. A significant number of game nominations have a figurative basis. In the designation of mobile, competitive games, names of animals and birds, names of elements (most often fire) are in demand. Nominations of socializing youth games, as well as their participants, are metaphorical; the direct meaning of these units refers to the social sphere (names elements of public life and social roles). Some games and roles are named after significant sociohistorical events (for example, war). Metaphors based on the physical qualities of a person and the characteristics of artifacts are unique in the studied material. Names of games can also reflect their principles, basic rules. Some names have an unclear motivation, which determines the prospect of further research. The variety of gaming vocabulary functioning in the dialect indicates the importance of this layer of folk culture. Its study is productive for describing the dialect language worldview and gives an opportunity to consider its individual aspects.

TI  - Towards a novel backdating strategy for creating built-up land time series data using contemporary spatial constraints
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For retrospective land cover change analysis extending back in time earlier than approximately the year 2000, multispectral remote sensing data such as the Landsat archive are often the only available and systematically archived data source. However, the spatial resolution of such observations often impedes the change analysis of geographic phenomena that may occur at sub-pixel level, such as changes in built-up land. In such cases, the integration of these data products with increasingly available contemporary high resolution settlement data employed as spatial constraints can potentially mitigate this drawback. Little research has been done regarding the quantitative potential of such integrative approaches, often due to the lack of multi-temporal reference data about changes in built-up area at sufficient spatio-temporal granularity and extent. In this contribution, we present and evaluate a time-series based approach for built-up area change analysis using Landsat time series data, spatially constrained by contemporary building footprint data. We evaluate the potential of our approach using a highly accurate multi-temporal reference database of built-up areas created through integrating publicly available building footprint and cadastral data in selected regions of the United States of America.

CP  - IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for AeroSpace (MetroAeroSpace)
CL  - Torino, ITALY
AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight how the employment of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technique can enhance greatly the performance and reliability of many monitoring systems applied to the Earth Observation (EO) and Environmental Monitoring. A short presentation of LiDAR systems, underlying their peculiarities, is first given. References to some review papers are highlighted, as they can be regarded as useful guidelines for researchers interested in using LiDARs. Two case studies are then presented and discussed, based on the use of 2D and 3D LiDAR data. Some considerations are done on the performance achieved through the use of LiDAR data combined with data from other sources. The case studies show how the LiDAR-based systems, combined with optical Very High Resolution (VHR) data, succeed in improving the analysis and monitoring of specific areas of interest, specifically how LiDAR data help in exploring external environment and extracting building features from urban areas. Moreover the discussed Case Studies demonstrate that the use of the LiDAR data, even with a low density of points, allows the development of an automatic procedure for accurate building features extraction, through object-oriented classification techniques, therefore by underlying the importance that even simple LiDAR-based systems play in EO and Environmental Monitoring.

TI  - Estimation of Variance and Spatial Correlation Width for Fine-Scale Measurement Error in Digital Elevation Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we borrow from the blind noise parameter estimation (BNPE) methodology early developed in the image processing field an original and innovative no-reference approach to estimate digital elevation model (DEM) vertical error parameters without resorting to a reference DEM. The challenges associated with the proposed approach related to the physical nature of the error and its multifactor structure in DEM are discussed in detail. A suitable multivariate method is then developed for estimating the error in gridded DEM. It is built on a recently proposed vectorial BNPE method for estimating spatially correlated noise using noise informative areas and fractal Brownian motion. The new multivariate method is derived to estimate the effect of the stacking procedure and that of the epipolar line error on local (fine-scale) standard deviation and autocorrelation function width of photogrammetric DEM measurement error. Applying the new estimator to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) GDEM2 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D DEMs, good agreement of derived estimates with results available in the literature is evidenced. Adopted for TanDEM-X-DEM, estimates obtained agree well with the values provided in the height error map. In future works, the proposed no-reference method for analyzing DEM error can be extended to a larger number of predictors for accounting for other factors influencing remote sensing (RS) DEM accuracy.

TI  - Optical Water Type Guided Approach to Estimate Optical Water Quality Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, water monitoring programs are mainly based on in situ measurements; however, this approach is time-consuming, expensive, and may not reflect the status of the whole water body. The availability of Multispectral Imager (MSI) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) free data with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution has increased the potential of adding remote sensing techniques into monitoring programs, leading to improvement of the quality of monitoring water. This study introduced an optical water type guided approach for boreal regions inland and coastal waters to estimate optical water quality parameters, such as the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM), the absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at a wavelength of 442 nm (aCDOM(442)), and the Secchi disk depth, from hyperspectral, OLCI, and MSI reflectance data. This study was based on data from 51 Estonian and Finnish lakes and from the Baltic Sea coastal area, which altogether were used in 415 in situ measurement stations and covered a wide range of optical water quality parameters (Chl-a: 0.5-215.2 mg.m(-3); TSM: 0.6-46.0 mg.L-1; aCDOM(442): 0.4-43.7 m(-1); and Secchi disk depth: 0.2-12.2 m). For retrieving optical water quality parameters from reflectance spectra, we tested 132 empirical algorithms. The study results describe the best algorithm for each optical water type for each spectral range and for each optical water quality parameter. The correlation was high, from 0.87 up to 0.93, between the in situ measured optical water quality parameters and the parameters predicted by the optical water type guided approach.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Aspects of Causality as an Ontological and Epistemological Category
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with describing a variety of interpretations of causality in different branches of modern science focusing on its multidisciplinary aspects. Moreover, historical and genetically reasoned aspects of causality in different areas are highlighted in this work. The authors take for granted that everything observable and calculable is commonly beyond dispute, and a deep understanding of causal reasoning creates an opportunity to govern different processes in various areas of human activity. Hence, interpretation of causality can be related to formal, natural, and social sciences, among which are physics, medicine, logic, philosophy, jurisprudence, psychology, and linguistics. To achieve the purpose of the paper, the authors employed such methods as observation, analysis, deduction, induction, synthesis, and description. The study proves that application of ideas obtained from physics (the hypothetical theory of a multiverse existence), logic (the implicative connection between actions), philosophy (generation of one phenomenon by another in both objective and subjective reality), psycholinguistics (the notion of mental causation), and linguistics (variety of linguistic means to express causality in different languages) shapes views of people on the interpretation of the phenomenon of causality and contributes to further comprehensive study of the causality using different approaches, linguistic inclusive. The paper also provides evidence for the causal reasoning being one of the most important mechanisms of categorization of the real world, thus making causality multidimensional. In conclusion, it is worth mentioning that modern global processes in all areas of human life demand a higher level of cross-cultural communication. The abovementioned signifies that one should be cautious in choosing language means to reflect the nuances of causal fragment of his/her worldview in order to be properly understood by speakers not only of other languages/cultures, but also by their own, for different speakers can perceive and interpret reality differently.

TI  - A New Passive Microwave Tool for Operational Forest Fires Detection: A Case Study of Siberia in 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present a new method for early detection of forest fires, especially in forest zones prone to fires using microwave remote sensing and information-modeling tools. A decision-making system is developed as a tool for operational coupled analysis of modeling results and remote sensing data. The main operating structure of this system has blocks that calculate the moisture of forest canopy, the soil-litter layer, and the forest physical temperature using the observed brightness temperature provided by the flying platform IL-18 equipped with passive microwave radiometers of 1.43, 13.3 and 37.5 GHz frequencies. The hydrological parameters of the forest are assessed with both a developed regional hydrological model and remote sensing observations. The hydrological model allows for the detection of fire-prone zones that are subject to remote sensing when modeling results are corrected and thermal temperatures are evaluated. An approach for the real time forest fires classification via daytime remote sensing observations is proposed. The relative theoretical and experimental results presented here have allowed us to use a new approach to forests monitoring during periods of potential fire. A decision-making algorithm is presented that aims at analyzing data flows from radiometers located on the remote sensing platform to calculate the probability of forest fire occurring in geographical pixels. As case study, the state of forest fires that occurred in Siberia in 2019 using microwave remote sensing measurements conducted by a flying IL-18 laboratory is presented. This remote sensing platform is equipped with optical and microwave tools that allow the optical and microwave images of the observed forest areas. The main operating frequencies of microwave radiometers are 1.43, 13.3 and 37.5 GHz. Microwave radiometers provide data on water content in the forest canopy and on litter and physical temperatures. Based on the long-term measurements made in Siberia, the possible improvement of the proposed decision-making system for future relevant studies is discussed in detail. The basic idea of cost-effective monitoring of forested areas consists of a two-stage exploration of fire risk zones. The first monitoring stage is performed using the hydrological model of the study area to identify low moisture areas of the forest canopy and litter. The second stage of monitoring is conducted using the remote sensing platform only in the local fire-dangerous areas in order to more precisely identify the areas prone to fire and to detect and diagnose real burning zones. The developed algorithm allows the calculation of physical temperatures and the detection of temperature anomalies based on measured brightness temperatures. Finally, the spatial distribution of the probability of forest fire occurrence is given as an example of the decision-making system along with a comparison of this distribution with the satellite images provided by the EOSDIS Land data.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of forest fire on water balance using fire susceptibility maps
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sudden and long term changes in the landscape can be attributed to periodic wildfires which, is a cyclic occurrence at Kudremukh national forest in Western Ghats of India. These land-use changes influence the hydrology of landscape, causing disintegration of soil, loss of biodiversity, changes in stream and flooding. To understand and account for these land-use changes, a new approach was implemented by developing fire susceptibility map from topographic, climatic and human-induced factors and validating it with MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) fire points for discretising accuracy. The fire susceptibility map can be used for studying the long-term (year or more) effects of fire on water balance systems. The fire susceptibility map generated for the years 2005 and 2017 was overlaid with MODIS LULC (Land Use Land Cover) for establishing the post-fire scenario whereas MODIS LULC MCD12Q1 (2005 and 2017) was considered as the no-fire scenario to analyse the intensity of the fire and its effect on streamflow and infiltration. These maps along with historical satellite hydro-climatic datasets, were used to assess the effect of forest fire on hydrological parameters using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. No-fire and post-fire conditions were established by modifying SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number) based on previous works of literature to represent the catchment as unburnt and burnt area. The SWAT model was calibrated (2002-2008) and validated (2009-2012) for establishing a baseline scenario. The sensitive parameters obtained from SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting) algorithm in SWAT-CUP (Calibration and Uncertainty Programs) were used to simulate stream flows fill 2017 due to lack of observed streamflow data for the year 2017. It was inferred that the effect of wildfire on flows in recent years (2017) had increased radically when compared to the flows before a decade (2005), diminishing the rate of infiltration and causing the deficit in groundwater to energise. The methodology can further be executed in any forest area for distinguishing fire hazard zones and implementing prior actions in those areas for mitigation of forest fires and maintaining sustainable water balance.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article

CP  - 21st World Conference of the Air-Transport-Research-Society (ATRS)
CL  - Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, BELGIUM
AB  - For decades sustainability has been proposed as a framework for a necessary paradigm shift in transport planning. However, critical scholars have shown how this concept, presented with a strong emphasis on economic growth, has limited capacity to truly challenge the current transport-related environmental and social crises or to constitute an ecological worldview.This paper explores resourcefulness as a complementary concept to inform transport planning and practice. A resourcefulness-based worldview, informed by critical theory and challenging the current distribution of material, intellectual and civic resources, aims to constitute a political shift towards guaranteeing the conditions for challenging crises and for just deliberations concerning ecological futures.The idea of resourcefulness is not proposed as a blueprint for transport planning, nor as a top-down theoretical framework. Rather, with a research approach inspired by Participatory Action Research, it is explored in dialogue with the practices of two grassroots movements: the Urban Mobility Forum and the Move Your City project. These movements have been proposing alternative transport planning views and practices in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and L'Aquila (Italy).

TI  - Object-Based Classification Approaches for Multitemporal Identification and Monitoring of Pastures in Agroforestry Regions using Multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sown Biodiverse Pastures (SBP) are the basis of a high-yield grazing system tailored for Mediterranean ecosystems and widely implemented in Southern Portugal. The application of precision farming methods in SBP requires cost-effective monitoring using remote sensing (RS). The main hurdle for the remote monitoring of SBP is the fact that the bulk of the pastures are installed in open Montado agroforestry systems. Sparsely distributed trees cast shadows that hinder the identification of the underlaying pasture using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery. Image acquisition in the Spring is made difficult by the presence of flowers that mislead the classification algorithms. Here, we tested multiple procedures for the geographical, object-based image classification (GEOBIA) of SBP, aiming to reduce the effects of tree shadows and flowers in open Montado systems. We used remotely sensed data acquired between November 2017 and May 2018 in three Portuguese farms. We used three machine learning supervised classification algorithms: Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We classified SBP based on: (1) a single-period image for the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) epoch in each of the three farms, and (2) multi-temporal image stacking. RF, SVM and ANN were trained using some visible (red, green and blue bands) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance bands, plus NDVI and a Digital Surface Model (DSM). We obtained high overall accuracy and kappa index (higher than 79% and 0.60, respectively). The RF algorithm had the highest overall accuracy (more than 92%) for all farms. Multitemporal image classification increased the accuracy of the algorithms. as it helped to correctly identify as SBP the areas covered by tree shadows and flower patches, which would be misclassified using single image classification. This study thus established the first workflow for SBP monitoring based on remotely sensed data, suggesting an operational approach for SBP identification. The workflow can be applied to other types of pastures in agroforestry regions to reduce the effects of shadows and flowering in classification problems.

TI  - SOIL COVER SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS OF FOREST-STEPPE ZONE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the phenomenon of soil cover spatial heterogeneity and its influence on the lands productivity of the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. The basic patterns of existence and functioning of micro-depressions (potholes) on chernozem soils, directly on the agricultural fields of the research farm "Velikosnitinske" in Kiev region are determined. It has been found that one of the most important reasons of vegetation and crop yields variegation of the experimental farm field crop rotations is that microrelief elements of various shapes and depths are common here. The main factor affecting soils and vegetation is the water regime of such micro-depressions, which differs significantly from the water regime of lowland territories. Depending on the redistribution of atmospheric moisture over the topography of the field, the agroecological condition, properties and biological activity of the soil, the physiological state of the plants vary changing indicators of the size and quality of the crop. UAV (drones), GPS-receiver and satellite images Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, internet weather service rp5 were the instruments for studying the dynamics of the water regime of micro-depressions and the state of vegetation. It was determined that the uneven distribution of moisture in agrolandscapes leads to the formation of various soil differences and has a significant effect on crop formation and the duration of the growing season of crops. Research results can be used in precision farming and in compiling detailed soil maps. It is proposed to use the identified patterns in the development of technologies for growing crops under conditions of spatial heterogeneity of the water regime of soils.

TI  - Characterizing over Four Decades of Forest Disturbance in Minnesota, USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information about disturbance driven patterns of forest structure and ages across landscapes provide a valuable resource for all land management efforts including cross-ownership collaborative forest treatments and restoration. While disturbance events in general are known to impact stand characteristics, the agent of change may also influence recovery and the supply of ecosystem services. Our study utilizes the full extent of the Landsat archive to identify the timing, extent, magnitude, and agent, of the most recent fast disturbance event for all forested lands within Minnesota, USA. To account for the differences in the Landsat sensors through time, specifically the coarser spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolutions of the early MSS sensors, we employed a two-step approach, first harmonizing spectral indices across the Landsat sensors, then applying a segmentation algorithm to fit temporal trends to the time series to identify abrupt forest disturbance events. We further incorporated spectral, topographic, and land protection information in our classification of the agent of change for all disturbance patches. After allowing two years for the time series to stabilize, we were able to identify the most recent fast disturbance events across Minnesota from 1974-2018 with a change versus no-change validation accuracy of 97.2% +/- 1.9%, and higher omission (14.9% +/- 9.3%) than commission errors (1.6% +/- 1.9%) for the identification of change patches. Our classification of the agent of change exhibited an overall accuracy of 96.5% +/- 1.9% with classes including non-disturbed forest, land conversion, fire, flooding, harvest, wind/weather, and other rare natural events. Individual class errors varied, but all class user and producer accuracies were above 78%. The unmatched nature of the Landsat archive for providing comparable forest attribute and change information across more than four decades highlights the value of the totality of the Landsat program to the larger geospatial, ecological research, and forest management communities.

T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral structure and trends in variations of local nonmodeled deformations of Earth at the Simeiz site are the focus of this study. In the time series of radio interferometric observations carried out within international projects, periodic components in addition to surface deformations at the Simeiz site were found and modeled. The amplitude of the most significant seasonal component is 3.34 mm. With the frequency-time wavelet transform, the time localization and changes in the power and frequency of oscillations were revealed for the time interval from 1980 to 2014. It was found that regular solar and geodynamic oscillations observed in the satellite data influenced the insolation of Earth's surface at the Kara-Dag site in the period from 1983.5 to 2005.5. Parameters of the seasonal component were determined. Possible causes of the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal component are discussed.

TI  - A Quasigeoid-Derived Transformation Model Accounting for Land Subsidence in the Mekong Delta towards Height System Unification in Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A vertical offset model for Vietnam and its surrounding areas was determined based on the differences between height anomalies derived from 779 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/levelling points and those derived from a dedicated high-resolution gravimetric-only quasigeoid model called GEOID_LSC. First, the deterministic transformation model to effectively fit the differences between the quasigeoid and GNSS/levelling heights was based on a third-order polynomial model. Second, the residual height anomalies have been interpolated to a grid employing Least-Squares Collocation. Finally, the distortions were restored to the residual grid. This model can be used for combination with a gravimetric quasigeoid model in GNSS levelling. The quality of GNSS/levelling data in Vietnam was analyzed and evaluated in this study. The annual subsidence rate from ALOS-1 was also used to analyze the effects of subsidence on the quality of GNSS/levelling data in the Mekong Delta. From this we made corrections to improve the accuracy of GNSS/levelling data in this region. The offset model was evaluated using cross-validation technique by comparing with GNSS/levelling data. Results indicate that the offset model has a standard deviation of 5.9 cm in the absolute sense. Based on this offset model, GNSS levelling can be carried out in most of Vietnam's territory complying third-order levelling requirements, while the accuracy requirements for fourth-order levelling networks is met for the entire country. This model in combination with the developed gravimetric quasigeoid model should also contribute to the modernization of Vietnam's height system. We also used high-quality GNSS/levelling data and the determined quasigeoid model to determine the geopotential value W-0 for the Vietnam Local Vertical Datum. The gravity potential of the Vietnam Local Vertical Datum is estimated equal to W-0(LVD) = 62,636,846.81 +/- 0.70 m(2)s(-2) with the global equipotential surface realized by the conventional value W-0 = 62,636,853.4 m(2)s(-2).

TI  - Acral Lentiginous Melanoma: Do Surgical Approach and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Matter?
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Management of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) remains controversial. Traditionally, ALM was managed with digit amputation (DA), resulting in significant morbidity, but recent evidence has advocated for digit sparing management. Furthermore, the significance of nodal metastasis for ALM is not well reported. The aims of this study were to determine if surgical approach for primary ALM impacts outcomes and to evaluate the predictive value of nodal status for ALM.Methods: Patients with localized ALM diagnosed from 1982 to 2017 were retrospectively identified. Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated with surgical approach, nodal metastasis, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival.Results: There were 47 patients with ALM. Median age was 59 years, and median thickness was 3mm. 51% of patients underwent wide local excision (WLE), 27.9% underwent DA, and 20.9% underwent partial digit amputation (PDA). ALM on the hand versus foot (OR: 12.7, 95%, confidence interval (CI), 2.0-80.1; P = 0.007) and subungual versus nonsubungual location (OR: 28.0, 95% confidence interval, 2.7-295.7; P = 0.006) were significantly associated with surgical approach (DA and PDA versus WLE). There were no significant differences in overall survival or recurrence-free survival between DA, PDA, or WLE cases (P = 0.481 and P = 0.778, respectively). There were no significant differences in overall survival or recurrence-free survival based on nodal status (P = 0.562 and P = 0.136, respectively).Conclusions: No significant differences in overall survival or recurrence-free survival were seen between ALM patients treated with DA, PDA, and WLE. Given these results, PDA or WLE may be options in select patients with digital ALM; however, careful consideration must be taken when deciding on the surgical approach.

TI  - A Meta-Analytic Examination of the Continued Influence of Misinformation in the Face of Correction: How Powerful Is It, Why Does It Happen, and How to Stop It?
T2  - COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the extent of continued influence of misinformation in the face of correction and the theoretical explanations of this phenomenon. Aggregation of results from 32 studies (N = 6,527) revealed that, on average, correction does not entirely eliminate the effect of misinformation (r = -.05, p = .045). Corrective messages were found to be more successful when they are coherent, consistent with the audience's worldview, and delivered by the source of the misinformation itself. Corrections are less effective if the misinformation was attributed to a credible source, the misinformation has been repeated multiple times prior to correction, or when there was a time lag between the delivery of the misinformation and the correction. These findings are consistent with predictions based on theories of mental models and offer concrete recommendations for practitioners.

TI  - Analyzing parcel-level relationships between Luojia 1-01 nighttime light intensity and artificial surface features across Shanghai, China: A comparison with NPP-VIIRS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data have been widely used to derive socioeconomic indices at national and regional scales. However, few studies analyzed the factors that may explain NTL variations at a fine scale due to the limited resolution of existing NTL data. As a new generation NTL satellite, Luojia 1-01 provides NTL data with a finer spatial resolution of similar to 130 m and can be used to assess the relationship between NTL intensity and artificial surface features on an unprecedented scale. This study represents the first efforts to assess the relationship between Luojia 1-01 NTL intensity and artificial surface features at the parcel level in comparison to the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) NTL data. Points-of-interest (POIs) and land-use/land-cover (LULC) data were used in random forest (RF) regression models for both Luojia 1-01 and NPP-VIIRS to analyze the feature contribution of artificial surface features to NTL intensity. The results show that luminosity variations in Luojia 1-01 data for different land-use types were more significant than those in NPP-VIIRS data because of the finer spatial resolution and wider measurement range. Seventeen variables extracted from POI and LULC data explained the Luojia 1-01 and NPP-VIIRS NTL intensity, with a good out-of-bag score of 0.62 and 0.76, respectively. Moreover, Luojia 1-01 data had fewer "blooming" phenomena than NPP-VIIRS data, especially for cropland, water body, and rural area. Luojia 1-01 is more suitable for estimating socioeconomic activities and can attain more comprehensive information on human activities, since the feature contribution of POI variables is more sensitive to NTL intensity in the Luojia 1-01 RF regression model than that in the NPP-VIIRS RF regression model.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass of the mangrove forests on northeast Hainan Island in China using an upscaling method from field plots, UAV-LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove forests of northeast Hainan Island are the most species diverse forests in China and consist of the Dongzhai National Nature Reserve and the Qinglan Provincial Nature Reserve. The former reserve is the first Chinese national nature reserve for mangroves and the latter has the most abundant mangrove species in China. However, to date the aboveground ground biomass (AGB) of this mangrove region has not been quantified due to the high species diversity and the difficulty of extensive field sampling in mangrove habitat. Although three-dimensional point clouds can capture the forest vertical structure, their application to large areas is hindered by the logistics, costs and data volumes involved. To fill the gap and address this issue, this study proposed a novel upscaling method for mangrove AGB estimation using field plots, UAV-LiDAR strip data and Sentinel-2 imagery (named G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 model) based on a point-line-polygon framework. In this model, the partial-coverage UAV-LiDAR data were used as a linear bridge to link ground measurements to the wall-to-wall coverage Sentinel-2 data. The results showed that northeast Hainan Island has a total mangrove AGB of 312,806.29 Mg with a mean AGB of 119.26 Mg ha(-1). The results also indicated that at the regional scale, the proposed UAV-LiDAR linear bridge method (i.e., G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 model) performed better than the traditional approach, which directly relates field plots to Sentinel-2 data (named the G similar to S2 model) (R-2 = 0.62 > 0.52, RMSE = 50.36 Mg ha(-1) < 56.63 Mg ha(-1)). Through a trend extrapolation method, this study inferred that the G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 model could decrease the number of field samples required by approximately 37% in comparison with those required by the G similar to 52 model in the study area. Regarding the UAV-LiDAR sampling intensity, compared with the original number of LiDAR plots, 20% of original linear bridges could produce an acceptable accuracy (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 51.03 Mg ha(-1)). Consequently, this study presents the first investigation of AGE for the mangrove forests on northeast Hainan Island in China and verifies the feasibility of using this mangrove AGB upscaling method for diverse mangrove forests.

TI  - Water Identification from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on Multidimensional Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate acquisition of water information from remote sensing images has become important in water resources monitoring and protections, and flooding disaster assessment. However, there are significant limitations in the traditionally used index for water body identification. In this study, we have proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), based on the multidimensional densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet), for identifying water in the Poyang Lake area. The results from DenseNet were compared with the classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet, VGG, SegNet and DeepLab v3+, and also compared with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Results have indicated that CNNs are superior to the water index method. Among the five CNNs, the proposed DenseNet requires the shortest training time for model convergence, besides DeepLab v3+. The identification accuracies are evaluated through several error metrics. It is shown that the DenseNet performs much better than the other CNNs and the NDWI method considering the precision of identification results; among those, the NDWI performance is by far the poorest. It is suggested that the DenseNet is much better in distinguishing water from clouds and mountain shadows than other CNNs.

TI  - Thermal unmixing based downscaling for fine resolution diurnal land surface temperature analysis
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitation in the availability of airborne imagery data that are high in both spatial and temporal resolution, land surface temperature (LST) dense in both space and time can only be obtained through downscaling of frequently acquired LST with coarse resolution. Many conventional downscaling techniques are only feasible in an ideal situation, where land surface factors as LST predictors are continuously available for downscaling the LST. These techniques are also applied only at large scales ignoring sub-regional variations. Based upon unmixing based approaches, this study presents an LST downscaling workflow, where only the coarse resolution of 1 km LST image at the prediction time is required. The conceptual backbone of the study is assuming that the LST patterns are governed by thermal behaviors of a fixed set of temperature sensitive land surface components. In operation, the study focuses on central Netherlands covering an area of 90 x 90 km. The MODIS and Landsat imagery acquired simultaneously are used as a coarse-fine resolution pair to derive downscaling mechanism which is then applied to coarse imagery at a time with missing fine resolution imagery. First, an optimal number of thermal components are extracted at fine resolution through the application of the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). These components are assumed to possess unique temperature change patterns caused by combined effects of land cover change, radiance change, or both. Given the LST change and thermal components at coarse resolution, the LST change load of each component can then be obtained at the coarse resolution by solving a system of linear equations encoding thermal component-LST relationship. Such LST change load of thermal components is further unmixed to fine resolution and linearly weighted by the component distribution at fine resolution to obtain the fine resolution LST change. During the process, the coarse LST data is used directly without any resampling practice as shown in previous studies. Thus the technique is less time consuming even with a large downscaling factor of 30. The downscaled fine resolution LST represents an R-squared of over 0.7 outperforming classic downscaling techniques. The downscaled LST differentiates temperature over major land types and captures both seasonal and diurnal LST dynamics.

TI  - Evaluation of Himawari-8 version 2.0 aerosol products against AERONET ground-based measurements over central and northern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8, a new generation geostationary satellite, carries the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), which can provide high temporal resolution observations (10 min) in monitoring the distribution and variation of aerosol over large areas. Recently, the AHI aerosol algorithm was refined, and the updated AHI version 2.0 Level 2 aerosol products were released. However, these products have not been comprehensively evaluated. This study aims to assess the accuracy of AHI version 2.0 Level 2 aerosol products over central and northern China. We compared nine hourly (Beijing time: 08:00 to 16:00) AHI Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) retrievals from 2016 to 2017 with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements over four merged sites: Beijing-urban, Xianghe, Xuzhou and Baotou. The results show that the AHI AOT product provides accurate retrievals at 09:00, 10:00 and 11:00, but these values overestimated AOT at high aerosol loadings. In contrast, AHI AOT retrievals at 13:00, 14:00 and 15:00 exhibit significant overestimation. More than 67% of these retrievals fell above the Expected Error (EE: +/- 0.15 x AOT(AERONET) +/- 0.05). The AHI Quality Assurance (QA_flag) performs poorly in constraining overestimation of the AHI AOT product. The "no confidence" angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), additional cloud and surface reflectance factors in the QA_flag have negative impacts on AOT retrieval accuracy. For different aerosol models, the AHI AE and Optical Depth Ratio fine (RF) products exhibit large differences between the forenoon (09:00, 10:00 and 11:00) and afternoon (13:00, 14:00 and 15:00). However, the AHI Single-scattering albedo (SSA) values mainly distribute in the range from 0.93 to 0.94, exhibiting minor differences in different times, sites and aerosol models. These results indicated that these products have errors induced by the AHI algorithm.

TI  - Monitoring maize growth on the North China Plain using a hybrid genetic algorithm-based back-propagation neural network model
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth and early yield information is crucial for the establishment and adjustment of agricultural management plans. Timely, precise and regional assessments of crop growth conditions and production greatly benefit the national economy and agriculture. In this study, remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) data retrieved from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were selected as the key indicators of maize growth and a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-based back-propagation neural network (BPNN) (GA-BPNN) model was applied to provide complementary information on maize growth at the main growth stage. GA-BPNN models with different architectures were established, and an architecture with 10, 9 and 1 nodes in the input, hidden and output layers, respectively, achieved the best training and testing performance. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of the training and testing samples were 588.2 kg/ha and 663.4 kg/ha, respectively. Thus, the hybrid model with the best architecture (10-9-1) was selected to calculate the values of the integrated growth monitoring index (G) at the regional scale with a 1 km spatial resolution in the study area from 2010 to 2018. The results showed that the monitored maize growth well reflected the actual situation and the correlations between G values and sites' measured variables, such as the maize yield and soil relative humidity, were higher than that of a pure BPNN model. The linear relationship between the GA-BPNN-based G values and maize yields was analyzed to estimate the maize yield in the North China Plain. Most of the RMSE and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values between the estimated and actual maize yields were less than 700.0 kg/ha and 10.0%, respectively. Considering that the estimation errors of most statistical samples were small and there were no obvious differences between the estimated maize yields in the adjacent regions of the northern, central and southern plain, the GA-BPNN-based yield estimation model provided reliable and spatially continuous estimates of maize yield.

TI  - Using FengYun-3C VSM Data and Multivariate Models to Estimate Land Surface Soil Moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface soil moisture (SM) monitoring is crucial for global water cycle and agricultural dryness research. The FengYun-3C Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3C/MWRI) collects various Earth geophysical parameters, and the FY-3C/MWRI SM product (FY-3C VSM) has been widely applied to determine regional-scale surface SM contents. The FY-3C VSM retrieval accuracy in different seasons was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R) values between the retrieved and measured SM. A lower accuracy in July (RMSE = 0.164 cm(3)/cm(3), ubRMSE = 0.130 cm(3)/cm(3), and MAE = 0.120 cm(3)/cm(3)) than in the other months was found due to the impacts of vegetation and climate variations. To show a detailed relationship between SM and multiple factors, including vegetation coverage, location, and elevation, quantile regression (QR) models were used to calculate the correlations at different quantiles. Except for the elevation at the 0.9 quantile, the QR models of the measured SM with the FY-3C VSM, MODIS NDVI, latitude, and longitude at each quantile all passed the significance test at the 0.005 level. Thus, the MODIS NDVI, latitude, and longitude were selected for error correction during the surface SM retrieval process using FY-3C VSM. Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and multivariate back-propagation neural network (MBPNN) models with different numbers of input variables were built to improve the SM monitoring results. The MBPNN model with three inputs (MBPNN-3) achieved the highest R (0.871) and lowest RMSE (0.034 cm(3)/cm(3)), MAE (0.026 cm(3)/cm(3)), and mean relative error (MRE) (20.7%) values, which were better than those of the MLR models with one, two, or three independent variables (MLR-1, -2, -3) and those of the MBPNN models with one or two inputs (MBPNN-1, -2). Then, the MBPNN-3 model was applied to generate the regional SM in the United States from January 2019 to October 2019. The estimated SM images were more consistent with the measured SM than the FY-3C VSM. This work indicated that combining FY-3C VSM data with the MBPNN-3 model could provide precise and reliable SM monitoring results.

TI  - Research on ground deformation monitoring method in mining areas using the probability integral model fusion D-InSAR, sub-band InSAR and offset-tracking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the aim of addressing the problem of accurately monitoring complete deformation fields over mining areas by means of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), this paper proposes a solution to obtain complete deformation fields using the probability integral model to fuse deformation data derived from Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR), sub-band InSAR and offset-tracking. This method is used for small-scale, medium-scale and large-scale deformation monitoring using D-InSAR, sub-band InSAR and offset-tracking, respectively. Finally, the probability integral model is utilized to integrate the three deformation fields, and a complete deformation field with high-accuracy over the study area can be obtained. The method is tested on 13 TerraSAR-X (TSX) images from December 2, 2012 to April 24, 2013 of the working face 52,304 of the Daliuta mining area in Shaanxi province, China. The complete deformation field of the working face during the 113-day mining period is obtained. The results show that during the process of working face advancing, the subsidence basin has been expanding along the direction of excavation. The relationship between the average maximum subsidence rate and the advancing distance of the working face can be described by a quadratic polynomial. It has been also observed that, when the underground mining reaches the full mining condition, the maximum subsidence value does not increase further. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified against the global positioning system field survey data. The root mean square errors in the strike and dip directions are 0.134 m and 0.105 m, respectively. Due to the support provide by the reserved coal pillars, the subsidence value above the reserved coal pillars is smaller.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Light Use Efficiency and Gross Primary Productivity Using Three Different Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE), which characterizes the efficiency with which vegetation converts captured/absorbed radiation into organic dry matter through photosynthesis, is a key parameter for estimating vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). Studies suggest that diffuse radiation induces a higher LUE than direct radiation in short-term and site-scale experiments. The clearness index (CI), described as the fraction of solar incident radiation on the surface of the earth to the extraterrestrial radiation at the top of the atmosphere, is added to the parameterization approach to explain the conditions of diffuse and direct radiation in this study. Machine learning methods-such as the Cubist regression tree approach-are also popular approaches for studying vegetation carbon uptake. This paper aims to compare and analyze the performances of three different approaches for estimating global LUE and GPP. The methods for collecting LUE were based on the following: (1) parameterization approach without CI; (2) parameterization approach with CI; and (3) Cubist regression tree approach. We collected GPP and meteorological data from 180 FLUXNET sites as calibration and validation data and the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products and ERA-interim data as input data to estimate the global LUE and GPP in 2014. Site-scale validation with FLUXNET measurements indicated that the Cubist regression approach performed better than the parameterization approaches. However, when applying the approaches to global LUE and GPP, the parameterization approach with the CI became the most reliable approach, then closely followed by the parameterization approach without the CI. Spatial analysis showed that the addition of the CI improved the LUE and GPP, especially in high-value zones. The results of the Cubist regression tree approach illustrate more fluctuations than the parameterization approaches. Although the distributions of LUE presented variations over different seasons, vegetation had the highest LUE, at approximately 1.5 gC/MJ, during the whole year in equatorial regions (e.g., South America, middle Africa and Southeast Asia). The three approaches produced roughly consistent global annual GPPs ranging from 109.23 to 120.65 Pg/yr. Our results suggest the parameterization approaches are robust when extrapolating to the global scale, of which the parameterization approach with CI performs slightly better than that without CI. By contrast, the Cubist regression tree produced LUE and GPP with lower accuracy even though it performed the best for model validation at the site scale.

TI  - Dry cropland changes in China's Three Gorges Reservoir Region during the period 1990 to 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and analyzing changes in the extent of cultivated land may inform strategic decisions on issues of environmental and food security. The dry cropland area of 12000 km(2) in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China is essential for feeding the local population of approximate to 20 million, but is highly prone to soil erosion, leading to the delivery of excessive amounts of sediment and associated pollutants to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), and causing serious eco-environmental consequences. Against this background, this paper used Landsat images and a digital elevation model to analyze the altitudinal distribution of, and dynamic changes in, the area of dry cropland during the period 1990 to 2015. The results suggest that dry cropland was mainly distributed in the elevation range of 200-600 m. The dry cropland area decreased from 12525.37 km(2) to 11796.27 km(2) during the 25-year study period, including a particularly significant decrease in the rate of decrease from 6.93 km(2)/yr to 43.99 km(2)/yr after 2000. The largest decline in the dry cropland area occurred in the elevation range of 600-900 m. The transformations between dry cropland and forest revealed the impact of the TGR operation on the extent of dry cropland. A total of 528.79 km(2) of dry cropland with slopes >25 degrees were converted to forest after 2000, whereas a total of 642 km(2) of forest was converted to dry cropland during the study period, and these conversions mainly occurred between the elevation of 200-900 m. These spatiotemporal changes in the dry cropland area are likely to raise new issues concerning food security in the TGRR.

TI  - Improved Winter Wheat Spatial Distribution Extraction Using A Convolutional Neural Network and Partly Connected Conditional Random Field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of edge pixel classification is crucial for extracting the winter wheat spatial distribution from remote sensing imagery using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we proposed an approach using a partly connected conditional random field model (PCCRF) to refine the classification results of RefineNet, named RefineNet-PCCRF. First, we used an improved RefineNet model to initially segment remote sensing images, followed by obtaining the category probability vectors for each pixel and initial pixel-by-pixel classification result. Second, using manual labels as references, we performed a statistical analysis on the results to select pixels that required optimization. Third, based on prior knowledge, we redefined the pairwise potential energy, used a linear model to connect different levels of potential energies, and used only pixel pairs associated with the selected pixels to build the PCCRF. The trained PCCRF was then used to refine the initial pixel-by-pixel classification result. We used 37 Gaofen-2 images obtained from 2018 to 2019 of a representative Chinese winter wheat region (Tai'an City, China) to create the dataset, employed SegNet and RefineNet as the standard CNNs, and a fully connected conditional random field as the refinement methods to conduct comparison experiments. The RefineNet-PCCRF's accuracy (94.51%), precision (92.39%), recall (90.98%), and F1-Score (91.68%) were clearly superior than the methods used for comparison. The results also show that the RefineNet-PCCRF improved the accuracy of large-scale winter wheat extraction results using remote sensing imagery.

TI  - All-sky longwave downward radiation from satellite measurements: General parameterizations based on LST, column water vapor and cloud top temperature
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed surface longwave downward radiation (LWDR) plays an essential role in studying the surface energy budget and greenhouse effect. Most existing satellite-based methods or products depend on variables that are not readily available from space such as, liquid water path, air temperature, vapor pressure and/or cloud-base temperature etc., which seriously restrict the wide applications of satellite data. In this paper, new nonlinear parameterizations and a machine learning-based model for deriving all-sky LWDR are proposed based only on land surface temperature (LST), column water vapor and cloud-top temperature (CTT), that are relatively readily available day and night for most satellite missions. It is the first time to incorporate the CTT in the parameterizations for estimating LWDR under the cloudy-sky conditions. The results reveal that the new models work well and can derive all-sky global LWDR with reasonable accuracies (RMSE < 23 W/m(2), bias < 2.0 W/m(2)). The convenience of input data makes the new models easy to use, and thus will definitely expand the applicability of remotely sensed measurements in radiation budget fields and many land applications.

TI  - Anomaly Detection Method for Working Status of Low-Orbit Space Objects Based on Photometric Data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of the anomaly associated with the working status of satellites is an important part of space situational awareness and is an effective methodology to improve the efficiency of satellite surveillance and ensure the normal operation of the satellites. Due to the fast speed of low-orbit objects and the obvious change of observation geometry, the application of historical observation data is limited. In this study, an anomaly detection method is proposed based on the dynamic time-structured distance by combining the geometrical relation of the Sun-object-observation station, the orbit characteristics of the satellites, and the photometric relation of the space objects to quickly detect the working status of the satellites. Finally, using the proposed method, some photometric data of Fengyun, GPS and Tiangong at seven working status arc simulated. The results indicate that the accuracy rate of abnormal detection with respect to the working status of the space objects is more than 90%, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Tracking annual changes of coastal tidal flats in China during 1986-2016 through analyses of Landsat images with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats (non-vegetated area), along with coastal vegetation area, constitute the coastal wetlands (intertidal zone) between high and low water lines, and play an important role in wildlife, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed all the available Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery (-44,528 images) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth. The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170 ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods: a stable period during 1986-1992, an increasing period during 1993-2001 and a decreasing period during 2002-2016. The resulting annual coastal tidal flats maps could be used to support sustainable coastal zone management policies that preserve coastal ecosystem services and biodiversity in China.

TI  - Impact of the Dust Aerosol Model on the VIIRS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Product across China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has been observing aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is a critical parameter in air pollution and climate change, for more than 7 years since 2012. Due to limited and uneven distribution of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station in China, the independent data from the Campaign on Atmospheric Aerosol Research Network of China (CARE-China) was used to evaluate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS AOD products in six typical sites and analyze the influence of the aerosol model selection process in five subregions, particularly for dust. Compared with ground-based observations, the performance of all retrievals (except the Shapotou (SPT) site) is similar to other previous studies on a global scale. However, the results illustrate that the AOD retrievals with the dust model showed poor consistency with a regression equation as y = 0.312x + 0.086, while the retrievals obtained from the other models perform much better with a regression equation as y = 0.783x + 0.119. The poor AOD retrieval with the dust model was also verified by a comparison with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol product. The results show they have a lower correlation coefficient (R) and a higher mean relative error (MRE) when the aerosol model used in the retrieval is identified as dust. According to the Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI), the frequency of dust type over southern China is inconsistent with the actual atmospheric condition. In addition, a comparison of ground-based angstrom ngstrom exponent (alpha) values yields an unexpected result that the dust model percentage exceed 40% when alpha < 1.0, and the mean alpha shows a high value of 0.75. Meanwhile, the alpha peak value (1.1) of the "dust" model determined by a satellite retravel algorithm indicate there is some problem in the dust model selection process. This mismatching of the aerosol model may partly explain the low accuracy at the SPT and the systemic biases in regional and global validations.

TI  - The need for ecological ethics in a new ecological economics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoclassical economics has been dominated by anthropocentrism. We argue that much of ecological economics (EE) is now also dominated by this. EE should now break-free from anthropocentrism, including the commodification of nature. We suggest a 'new' ecological economics which foregrounds an ecocentric worldview, ecological ethics and ecojustice. These can assist society to reach a truly sustainable future where it accepts nature's intrinsic value and extends respect to the nonhuman world. Models associated with EE are considered in terms of their approach to ecological limits and equity, as well as ethics. The paper concludes the only EE model that comes close to foregrounding ecological ethics is the steady state economy. Most of the others explicitly (or implicitly) retain an anthropocentric bias. Four approaches to 'moving forward' are suggested: achieving ecocentrism; advocating Earth jurisprudence; supporting ecojustice; and dealing ethically with the commodification of nature. We argue that a rejuvenated EE should de-commodify nature. Hence we should consider 'People's Contributions to Nature', rather than just 'Nature's Contributions to People'. For both practical and ethical reasons, the paper concludes that EE needs to reevaluate its worldview and ethics. A possible research agenda is suggested that could help integrate ecological ethics with ecological economics.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines how Buddhists in America have been able to integrate evolution into their worldview to a much greater extent than other religious groups in the United States. Not only is evolution and science in general in line with the main teachings of Buddhism, but Buddhist teachers in the US have consistently encouraged Buddhists to embrace scientific findings and have even incorporated scientific data on evolutionary theory into their teachings. The fact that Buddhists in America have been able to accept and incorporate evolution into their spiritual practice is direct evidence of the fallacy of fundamentalist claims that the naturalistic reasoning used in scientific endeavor will necessarily lead students and researchers to lose their own spirituality, faith and humanity. By examining the ability for this spiritual practice to embrace science so wholly into their worldview, there may be lessons on how teachers can better remedy students' misconceptions about the dangers of science with regard to their own faith.

TI  - Active Fault Scarps in Southern Malawi and Their Implications for the Distribution of Strain in Incipient Continental Rifts
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of deformation during the early stages of continental rifting is an important constraint on our understanding of continental breakup. Incipient rifting in East Africa has been considered to be dominated by slip along rift border faults, with a subsequent transition to focused extension on axial segments in thinned crust and/or with active magmatism. Here, we study high-resolution satellite data of the Zomba Graben in southern Malawi, an amagmatic rift whose topography is dominated by the west-dipping Zomba fault. We document evidence for five subparallel fault scarps between 13 and 51 km long spaced 10-15 km apart. The scarps consist of up to five segments between 4 and 18 km long, separated by minima in scarp height and river knickpoints. The maximum height of each fault scarp ranges from 9.5 4.2 m to 35.3 14.6 m, with the highest scarp measured on the intrabasin Chingale Step fault. We estimate that the scarps were formed by multiple earthquakes of up to M(w)7.1 and represent a previously unrecognized seismic hazard. Our calculations show that 55 24% of extensional strain is accommodated across intrabasin faults within the 50 km wide rift. This demonstrates that a significant proportion of displacement can occur on intrabasin faults during early-stage rifting, even in thick continental lithosphere with no evidence for magmatic fluids.Plain Language Summary When continents begin to stretch, earthquakes occur on faults that incrementally accumulate slip to eventually form a rift valley. To estimate the hazard posed by these earthquakes, it is important to understand where these faults are located and how much stretching they each accommodate. We analyze faults in the Zomba Graben, a young rift in southern Malawi, using high-resolution satellite data. Steep scarps indicate that recent earthquakes have occurred at both the edges and in the middle of the rift valley. Pronounced activity in the rift middle is thought to require a thinned rigid outer layer of the Earth or mechanically unfavorable faults at the rift edge. Neither of these factors have been observed in southern Malawi. We suggest that the distribution of active faults, and hence of earthquakes, is likely controlled by weaknesses in the middle and lower parts of the Earth's crust.

TI  - Inland Lakes Mapping for Monitoring Water Quality Using a Detail/Smoothing-Balanced Conditional Random Field Based on Landsat-8/Levels Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable development of water resources is always emphasized in China, and a set of perfect standards for the division of inland water environment quality have been established to monitor water quality. However, most of the 24 indicators that determine the water quality level in the standards are non-optically active parameters. The weak optical characteristics make it difficult to find significant correlations between the single parameters and the remote sensing imagery. In addition, traditional on-site testing methods have been unable to meet the increasingly extensive water-quality monitoring requirements. Based on the above questions, it's meaningful that the supervised classification process of a detail-preserving smoothing classifier based on conditional random field (CRF) and Landsat-8 data was proposed in the two study areas around Wuhan and Huangshi in Hubei Province. The random forest classifier was selected to model the association potential of the CRF. The results (the first study area: OA = 89.50%, Kappa = 0.841; the second study area: OA = 90.35%, Kappa = 0.868) showed that the water-quality monitoring based on CRF model is feasible, and this approach can provide a reference for water-quality mapping of inland lakes. In the future, it may only require a small amount of on-site sampling to achieve the identification of the water quality levels of inland lakes across a large area of China.

TI  - Conceptualising Sustainability Using a Cognitive Mapping Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many different interpretations of the meaning of sustainability has the potential to cause dilution of meaning, as well as ambiguity and confusion, and a reduction in the use of sustainability as a relevant global objective. In this research, we examine these different interpretations using a cognitive mapping method, where 12 sustainability experts provide their own unique conceptualisations of sustainability. Our research objective is to develop a conceptual tool that explains differences in these many sustainability meanings. The experts' conceptualisations reveal worldviews that are predominantly anthropocentric, but which also contain principles consistent with the sustaincentrism paradigm. We observe that each expert's worldview, together with the assumed primary objective of sustainability, and the type of actions recommended to achieve sustainability, are central to understanding the diversity of sustainability conceptualisations. This insight leads to the development of a framework that infers sustainability can be conceptualised to consist of three distinct layers consisting of a core objective, or what is to be sustained; a worldview that underpins the conceptualisation; and actions aimed at achieving sustainability. By clarifying the multiple layers contained within sustainability conceptualisations, competing and contested versions of sustainability can be clarified within a common theoretical framework. The sustainability framework should also assist educators and students navigate through the multiplicity of sustainability meanings, and enable new context-specific definitions to be developed, such as those used in business and government.

TI  - AMARO-An On-Board Ship Detection and Real-Time Information System
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of worldwide ship traffic is a field of high topicality. Activities like piracy, ocean dumping, and refugee transportation are in the news every day. The detection of ships in remotely sensed data from airplanes, drones, or spacecraft contributes to maritime situational awareness. However, the crucial factor is the up-to-dateness of the extracted information. With ground-based processing, the time between image acquisition and delivery of the extracted product data is in the range of several hours, mainly due to the time consumed by storing and transmission of the large image data. By processing and analyzing them on-board and transmitting the product data directly as ship position, heading, and velocity, the delay can be shortened to some minutes. Real-time connections via satellite telecommunication services allow small packets of information to be sent directly to the user without significant delay. The AMARO (Autonomous Real-Time Detection of Moving Maritime Objects) project at DLR is a feasibility study of an on-board ship detection system involving on-board processing and real-time communication. The operation of a prototype system was successfully demonstrated on an airborne platform in spring 2018. The on-ground user could be informed about detected vessels within minutes after sighting without a direct communication link. In this article, the scope, aim, and design of the AMARO system are described, and the results of the flight experiment are presented in detail.

TI  - Spatial and temporal changes in ablation, distribution and evolution of glacial zones on Irenebreen, a small glacier of the High Arctic, Svalbard
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work was to provide a detailed description of the temporal and spatial variability of ablation on Irenebreen - with a focus on the spatial distribution and evolution of glacial zones in the summer season of 2017. Irenebreen is a small Arctic glacier on the Kaffioyra plain of north-western Spitsbergen. Direct field studies did not cover the whole period of ablation, and ablation zones were therefore also identified based on satellite data for a period extending beyond the research timeframe. The distribution and evolution of glacial zones on Irenebreen, the snow persisting on its surface and its phase transitions all result from the intensity and variability of ablation in the summer season, and thus may affect the total magnitude of ablation. The mean value of ablation in summer was 87.7 cm w.e. for the whole glacier. The application of satellite imaging in the near infrared channel enabled efficient classification of glacial zones based on the reflection coefficient. Glacial zones are an essential element in the assessment of the temporal and spatial variability of ablation. Their evolution is determined by ablation processes. It is therefore important to study the melting simultaneously with the temporal and spatial observations of the glacial zones. Classifying them is becoming more important as the melt season on Svalbard glaciers is significantly increasing.

TI  - Transitioning from change detection to monitoring with remote sensing: A paradigm shift
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of time series analysis with moderate resolution satellite imagery is increasingly common, particularly since the advent of freely available Landsat data. Dense time series analysis is providing new information on the timing of landscape changes, as well as improving the quality and accuracy of information being derived from remote sensing. Perhaps most importantly, time series analysis is expanding the kinds of land surface change that can be monitored using remote sensing. In particular, more subtle changes in ecosystem health and condition and related to land use dynamics are being monitored. The result is a paradigm shift away from change detection, typically using two points in time, to monitoring, or an attempt to track change continuously in time. This trend holds many benefits, including the promise of near real-time monitoring. Anticipated future trends include more use of multiple sensors in monitoring activities, increased focus on the temporal accuracy of results, applications over larger areas and operational usage of time series analysis.

TI  - Radiance-based NIR<sub>v</sub> as a proxy for GPP of corn and soybean
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial uncertainty exists in daily and sub-daily gross primary production (GPP) estimation, which dampens accurate monitoring of the global carbon cycle. Here we find that near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRv, Rad), defined as the product of observed NIR radiance and normalized difference vegetation index, can accurately estimate corn and soybean GPP at daily and half-hourly time scales, benchmarked with multi-year tower-based GPP at three sites with different environmental and irrigation conditions. Overall, NIRv, Rad explains 84% and 78% variations of half-hourly GPP for corn and soybean, respectively, outperforming NIR reflectance of vegetation (NIRv, Ref), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and far-red solar-induced fluorescence (SIF760). The strong linear relationship between NIRv, Rad and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by green leaves (APAR(green)), and that between APARgreen and GPP, explain the good NIRv,Rad-GPP relationship. The NIRv,Rad-GPP relationship is robust and consistent across sites. The scalability and simplicity of NIRv, Rad indicate a great potential to estimate daily or sub-daily GPP from high-resolution and/or long-term satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - The Rivalry of Spectacle: A Debordian-Lacanian Analysis of Contemporary Chinese Culture
T2  - CRITICAL INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1967 Guy Debord published the pamphlet-sized The Society of the Spectacle, a book written in the form of a collection of short theses. Debord was criticized for inventing the "spectacle" out of thin air by thinkers of his time such as Michel Foucault. We can, however, detect salient manifestations of the Debordian spectacular society in China of the 2010s. This paper demonstrates a deep and pervasive trend of spectacularization in China by analyzing (a) Taobao as a desire-creating machine producing the buy-buy-buy fanaticism, (b) the beautifying operation that has engendered perverted effects in sexual relationship, (c) the spectacular dialectic epitomized by the celebrity culture, and (d) the reality-twisting effects of the spectacles. The paper further offers a comparative analysis of the contemporary spectacles vis-a-vis the Maoist spectacles of the 1960s, which sheds light in understanding the enactment of antientertainment actions in recent years. The spectacles in contemporary China, in the fashion depicted by Debord half a century ago, have effectively produced a specific worldview of commodity and consumption, and this worldview transforms itself, through blind trust, into a type of objective force. The social terrains needed for spreading and cultivating socialist values were heavily colonized by the such spectacles (consumption, beautification, celebrity culture, entertainment); the latter have significantly absorbed the masses' attention in the last decade to such level that it has almost occupied all spaces for communication and played the leading role in regulating people's daily lives. The "Beauty is justice!" slogan that has been extremely popular in contemporary China reveals one significant change in Chinese culture and its sociopolitical effect: the trend of spectacularization, through elevating spectacle to the supreme value and turning the country into a spectacular (un)reality, has not only homogenized China but also effectively depoliticized the country.

TI  - Sentinel: generating GUI tests for sensor leaks in Android and Android wear apps
T2  - SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the widespread use of Android devices and apps, it is important to develop tools and techniques to improve app quality and performance. Our work focuses on a problem related to hardware sensors on Android devices: the failure to disable unneeded sensors, which leads to sensor leaks and thus battery drain. We propose the Sentinel testing tool to uncover such leaks. The tool performs static analysis of app code and produces a model which maps GUI events to callback methods that affect sensor behavior. Edges in the model are labeled with symbols representing the acquiring/releasing of sensors and the opening/closing of UI windows. The model is traversed to identify paths that are likely to exhibit sensor leaks during run-time execution based on two context-free languages over the symbol alphabet. The reported paths are then used to generate test cases. The execution of each test case tracks the run-time behavior of sensors and reports observed leaks. This approach has been applied to both open-sourced and closed-sourced regular Android applications as well as watch faces for Android Wear smartwatches. Our experimental results indicate that Sentinel effectively detects sensor leaks, while focusing the testing efforts on a very small subset of possible GUI event sequences.

TI  - Pen Culture Detection Using Filter Tensor Analysis with Multi-Temporal Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture plays an important role in China's total fisheries production nowadays, and it leads to a few problems, for example water quality degradation, which has damaging effect on the sustainable development of environment. Among the many forms of aquaculture that deteriorate the water quality, disorderly pen culture is especially severe. Pen culture began very early in Yangchenghu Lake and Taihu Lake in China and part of the pen culture still exists. Thus, it is of great significance to evaluate the distribution and area of the pen culture in the two lakes. However, the traditional method for pen culture detection is based on the factual measurement, which is labor and time consuming. At present, with the development of remote sensing technologies, some target detection algorithms for multi/hyper-spectral data have been used in the pen culture detection, but most of them are intended for the single-temporal remote sensing data. Recently, a target detection algorithm called filter tensor analysis (FTA), which is specially designed for multi-temporal remote sensing data, has been reported and has achieved better detection results compared to the traditional single-temporal methods in many cases. This paper mainly aims to investigate the pen culture in Yangchenghu Lake and Taihu Lake with FTA implemented on the multi-temporal Landsat imagery, by determining the optimal time phases combination of the Landsat data in advance. Furthermore, the suitability and superiority of FTA over Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) in the process of pen culture detection were tested. It was observed in the experiments on the data of those two lakes that FTA can detect the pen culture much more accurately than CEM with Landsat data of selected bands and of limited number of time phases.

TI  - Coupling the Occurrence of Correlative Plant Species to Predict the Habitat Suitability for Lesser White-fronted Goose (Anser erythropus) under Climate Change: A Case Study in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River.
T2  - Journal of Resources and Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities influence species biodiversity by altering their habitats. This paper quantitatively analyzed the effects of climate change on a migratory bird. The Lesser White-fronted Goose (LWfG), a species which migrates via the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River region, is an herbivorous species of high ecological value. It is an endangered species threatened by climate change and human activities, so comprehensive information about its distribution is required. To assess the effectiveness of conservation of the LWfG under climate change, both climate variables and human activities are often used to predict the potential changes in the distribution and habitat suitability for LWfG. In this work, the current scenario and the Global Circulation Models (GCMs) climate scenarios were used to simulate the future distribution of the species. However, besides climate change and human activities, the spatial pattern of plants surrounding the wetland is also known to be closely related to the distribution of LWfG. Therefore, the distribution model results of six plant species related to LWfG's diet selection were used as environment variables to reflect the changes of suitable LWfG habitat. These environmental variables significantly improved the model's performance for LWfG, since the birds were clearly influenced by the plant distribution factors. Meanwhile, the suitable habitat area decreases by 2070 in GCM models under two representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). More appropriate management and conservation policies should be taken to adapt to future climate change. These adjustments include modifications of the size, shape and use of the conservation area for this species.

TI  - Identifying geochemical anomaly through spatially anisotropic singularity mapping: A case study from silver-gold deposit in Pangxidong district, SE China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The anisotropic singularity analysis, also referred to as Spatially Weighted Singularity Mapping (SWSM), was developed by means of multifractal modeling and spatial weighting. The SWSM extends the application of the Ordinary Singularity Mapping (OSM) technique, which is spatially isotropic, to the anisotropic case. In this paper, the SWSM method was demonstrated in a case study where the geochemical anomaly associated with the silver-gold mineralization was identified through mapping the spatially anisotropic singularity of the pathfinder elements including Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, and Zn, to in Pangxidong district, south of the Qinzhou-Hangzhou Metallogenic Belt, SE China. Firstly, using the stream sediment geochemical data and spatial weighting factor linked to NE-trending ore-controlling fault system, the local anisotropic singularity index values (i.e. epsilon-values) were estimated for each of the five elements. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the epsilon-values to obtain comprehensive geochemical anomaly of the multiple element (i.e. PC1 scores). It appeared that the comprehensive geochemical anomaly has a better prediction efficiency with the discovered silver-gold occurrences than the one derived from the OSM-PCA approach (PCA applied to singularity index values estimated by the OSM technique). The performance tests were assessed by using the receiver operating characteristics as well as prediction-area plot and concentration-area fractal analysis methods. Finally, the student's t-static method was employed to determine the reasonable threshold values separating the geochemical anomaly and background. The student's t-values indicate that spatial correlation between the locations of the known silver-gold mineral deposits and the geochemical anomaly derived by the SWSM-PCA approach was much stronger than that of the geochemical anomaly derived by the OSM-PCA method. The geochemical anomalies delineated by the SWSM-PCA approach were considered to be the favorable target areas for exploration of similar undiscovered silver-gold polymetallic deposits. This study has demonstrated that the SWSM approach can incorporate the spatial anisotropic information (e.g. direction and range of spatial variability), which exhibits geological controlling features, into the singularity analysis of geo-variables in various geo-spatial datasets such as geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing data.

TI  - Deriving a Global and Hourly Data Set of Aerosol Optical Depth Over Land Using Data From Four Geostationary Satellites: GOES-16, MSG-1, MSG-4, and Himawari-8
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitations in the number of satellites and the swath width of satellites (determined by the field of view and height of satellites), it is impossible to monitor global aerosol distribution using polar orbiting satellites at a high frequency. This limits the applicability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data sets in many fields, such as atmospheric pollutant monitoring and climate change research, where a high-temporal data resolution may be required. Although geostationary satellites have a high-temporal resolution and an extensive observation range, three or more satellites are required to achieve global monitoring of aerosols. In this article, we obtain an hourly and global AOD data set by integrating AOD data sets from four geostationary weather satellites [Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-16), Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-1), MSG-4, and Himawari-8]. The integrated data set will expand the application range beyond the four individual AOD data sets. The integrated geostationary satellite AOD data sets from April to August 2018 were validated using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. The data set results were validated against: the mean absolute error, mean bias error, relative mean bias, and root-mean-square error, and values obtained were 0.07, 0.01, 1.08, and 0.11, respectively. The ratio of the error of satellite retrieval within +/-( $0.05+ 0.2\times $ AOD(AERONET)) is 0.69. The spatial coverage and accuracy of the MODIS/C61/AOD product released by NASA were also analyzed as a representative of polar orbit satellites. The analysis results show that the integrated AOD data set has similar accuracy to that of the MODIS/AOD data set and has higher temporal resolution and spatial coverage than the MODIS/AOD data set.

TI  - World-formative Christianity: An Interview with Christian Philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff
T2  - LOGOS & PNEUMA-CHINESE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This interview presents Christian thinker Nicholas Wolterstorff's vision of "World-formative Christianity" with focus on the concepts of love and justice, wonder and grief. It highlights the responsibility of Christians to engage and shape the world, particularly contributing to the flourishing of social institutions. It demonstrates the significance of the Christian understanding of justice, rights and dignity, which is interwoven with the sensitivity of injustice and grief in the world. The interview brings these issues into dialogue with Chinese cultural resources and social conditions, suggesting that his vision with the engagement of a Christian worldview in public life is relevant for Christian scholarship and Christians in the Chinese context. In particular, both the rational spirit of religious belief advanced by Christian philosophy and the Christian engagement with other disciplines with regard to some public issues is prominent for Christian scholarship in Chinese academia.

TI  - A Special Issue on Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The articles in this special section focus on inSAR (synthetic aperture radar interferometry) technology. This technology provides the unique ability to quantitatively map Earth's elevation and surface deformation with high spatial resolution and precision. For this reason, it is used in many remote sensing applications (e.g., landslides, wetland water-level observation, and mining subsidence). Since Seasat-A, the very first SAR satellite, was launched by NASA in 1978, many InSAR missions have been completed, are in progress, or will be launched soon. These include the current GF-3 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) SAR satellites and the nearfuture COSMO/Skymed 2nd Generation and Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. This has created a new class of radar data that has evolved significantly in recent decades. In the meantime, hundreds of research articles have been published exploring algorithms for InSAR signal processing and demonstrating related applications across many Earth observation fields of interest. It is fair to say that InSAR has evolved from its initial development as a new and pioneering radar remote sensing technique into a mature technology that can provide crucial constraints for a broad and diverse range of Earth-science processes.

TI  - Applying Satellite Data Assimilation to Wind Simulation of Coastal Wind Farms in Guangdong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of the wind power industry in China, accurate simulation of near-surface wind plays an important role in wind-resource assessment. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been widely used to simulate the near-surface wind speed. By combining the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model with the Three-dimensional variation (3DVar) data assimilation system, our work applied satellite data assimilation to the wind resource assessment tasks of coastal wind farms in Guangdong, China. We compared the simulation results with wind speed observation data from seven wind observation towers in the Guangdong coastal area, and the results showed that satellite data assimilation with the WRF model can significantly reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and improve the index of agreement (IA) and correlation coefficient (R). In different months and at different height layers (10, 50, and 70 m), the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) can be reduced by a range of 0-0.8 m/s from 2.5-4 m/s of the original results, the IA can be increased by a range of 0-0.2 from 0.5-0.8 of the original results, and the R can be increased by a range of 0-0.3 from 0.2-0.7 of the original results. The results of the wind speed Weibull distribution show that, after data assimilation was used, the WRF model was able to simulate the distribution of wind speed more accurately. Based on the numerical simulation, our work proposes a combined wind resource evaluation approach of numerical modeling and data assimilation, which will benefit the wind power assessment of wind farms.

TI  - AR<SUP>2</SUP>Net: An Attentive Neural Approach for Business Location Selection with Satellite Data and Urban Data
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Business location selection is crucial to the success of businesses. Traditional approaches like manual survey investigate multiple factors, such as foot traffic, neighborhood structure, and available workforce, which are typically hard to measure. In this article, we propose to explore both satellite data (e.g., satellite images and nighttime light data) and urban data for business location selection tasks of various businesses. We extract discriminative features from the two kinds of data and perform empirical analysis to evaluate the correlation between extracted features and the business popularity of locations. A novel neural network approach named R(2)Net is proposed to learn deep interactions among features and predict the business popularity of locations. The proposed approach is trained with a regression-and-ranking combined loss function to preserve accurate popularity estimation and the ranking order of locations simultaneously. To support the location selection for multiple businesses, we propose an approach named AR(2)Net with three attention modules, which enable the approach to focus on different latent features according to business types. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the satellite features are effective and our models outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of four metrics.

TI  - A GIS-Based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Model for Determining Glacier Vulnerability
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the causes of the spatial heterogeneity of glacial changes offers vital information about glacial behavior and provides forecasting ability to define where glacier retreat may occur in the future. This study was designed to determine the spatial distribution of Agri Mountain glacier vulnerability. The main goal of the current study was to assess the forecasting capabilities of Geographical Information System (GIS)-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for determining the location of the mountain glacier retreat. To estimate the glacier retreat, the following criteria were selected: elevation, aspect, slope, direction, and glacier surface temperature anomaly (GSTA). The entropy method was used for weighting the criteria for the evaluation of the vulnerable areas of the glacier. The results of this method clearly indicate a strong relationship between GSTA, direction, and elevation criteria and glacier retreat. The glacier vulnerability map was created by synthesizing criteria layers with their weights. The vulnerability map provided a consistency of 77.8% in the short term and 92.1% in the long term. In the study, the priority melting zones were determined and glacial retreat locations were forecasted in 10-year periods.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing data with WRF model for improved 2-m temperature and humidity simulations in China
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The default green vegetation fraction (GVF) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model version 3.7.1 was derived between 1985 and 1990 from the 1990s Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) achieved from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and its representation is deteriorating when used to simulate recent weather and climate events. In this study, we applied in WRF v3.7.1 the updated GVF estimated by the real-time NDVI of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to provide a better representation of the prescribed surface GVF condition. A one-year simulation was carried out in China, and the simulated 2-m air temperature and specific humidity were compared between the WRF model control experiment that employs the default GVF data (WRF-CTL), the WRF simulations with updated GVF (WRF-MODIS), and the observations from 824 weather stations in China. Results are significantly improved for both the 2-m air temperature and the specific humidity by WRF-MODIS, which has effectively reproduced the observed pattern and increased the correlation coefficient between the model simulations and observations. The RMSE and bias of specific humidity are also reduced in WRF-MODIS. In general, the real-time MODIS-NDVI based GVF reflected the realistic increase of vegetation cover in China when comparing to the WRF default GVF, and also provided a more accurate seasonal variation for the simulated year of 2009. As a result, the WRF-MODIS simulation significantly improves its representation in the simulated 2-m air temperature and specific humidity, both in spatial distributions and seasonal variations, due to the GVF's great contribution in modulating the coupled land-atmosphere interactions.

TI  - Integration of satellite remote sensing data in underground coal fire detection: A case study of the Fukang region, Xinjiang, China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Xinjiang in China is one of the areas worst affected by coal fires. Coal fires cannot only waste a large amount of natural resources and cause serious economic losses, but they also cause huge damage to the atmosphere, the soil, the surrounding geology, and the environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to effectively explore remote sensing based detection of coal fires for timely understanding of their latest development trend. In this study, in order to investigate the distribution of coal fires in an accurate and reliable manner, we exploited both Landsat-8 optical data and Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, using the generalized single-channel algorithm and the InSAR time-series analysis approach, respectively, for coal fire detection in the southern part of the Fukang region of Xinjiang, China. The generalized single-channel algorithm was used for land surface temperature information extraction. Meanwhile, the time-series InSAR analysis technology was employed for estimating the surface micro deformation information, which was then used for building a band-pass filter. The suspected coal fire locations could then be established by a band-pass filtering operation on the obtained surface temperature map. Finally, the locations of the suspected coal fires were validated by the use of field survey data. The results indicate that the integration of thermal infrared remote sensing and radar interferometry technologies is an efficient investigation approach for coal fire detection in a large-scale region, which would provide the necessary spatial information support for the survey and control of coal fires.

TI  - Comparison of extraction methods and the distribution characteristics of cluster bamboo forest information based on Sentinel-2
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Southwest Yunnan is enriched in landscapes of cluster bamboo forests and rare but unique resources of bamboo species. The development and utilization of bamboo resources are greatly limited by the uninformed distribution and growing stock of bamboo forests and the lack of proper monitoring techniques. Based on Sentinel-2A image data, we compared three machine learning methods : back-propagation neural network, support vector machine, and random forest, for classifying cluster bamboo forests and other land use types in Cangyuan County. Google Earth images and DEM data were used to analyze the spatial and topographic characteristics of the distribution of bamboo forests. The results showed that random forest achieved the best accuracy in classification, with overall accuracy of 90% , Kappa coefficient of 0.87, and user accuracy of 81%. With a total bamboo forest of 138.07 km(2), bamboo forests in Cangyuan are mainly located in towns and villages, along roads, rivers and cultivated lands. At a resolution of 10 m, Sentinel-2A data is good at characterizing spatially dispersed cluster bamboo forests. Cangyuan' s bamboo forests are mainly located at gentle slopes or incline at altitudes from 900 to 2000 m. Our results provided basis for the development and utilization of bamboo resources in Cangyuan County. The methods used here provided reference for monitoring cluster bamboo forests.

TI  - Simplified and Fast Atmospheric Radiative Transfer model for satellite-based aerosol optical depth retrieval
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval over land remains a considerable challenge when high temporal and spatial resolutions are required. This paper presents the Simplified and Fast Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SFART) model for direct calculation of satellite AOD via analytical equations rather than the lookup table (LUT) approach. The SFART model considers the impact of both Rayleigh and aerosol multiple scattering. A comprehensive comparison with the Simplified Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) and single scattering approximation method is conducted. In validation with 6S, good atmospheric reflectance (Rayleigh thorn aerosol) accuracy is achieved by SFART, with approximately 69% of the data falling within the 5% estimated error (EE) envelope at both 440 and 640 nm. This is higher than the SMAC accuracy (within 5% EE: 42.83% and 39.91% at 440 and 640 nm, respectively) and is a tremendous improvement over the single scattering approximation method (within 5% EE: 15.67% and 20.5% at 440 and 640 nm, respectively). SFART is then applied for AOD retrieval to Himawari-8 satellite data over the North China Plain on both normal and hazy days. The retrieved AOD values are validated against collected AERONET data (Version 3, Level 2.0). Approximately 59% of the SFART AOD values fall within the EE bounds of +/-(0.05 + 15%) with a root mean squared error of 0.22 (for 339 collocations). The promising results given by SFART indicate that this method can facilitate improved AOD calculation using empirical or real-time aerosol models in an efficient and flexible manner.

TI  - Spatio-temporal characteristics of the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources based on ecosystem services in Central Asia
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of matching degree among water, soil, and heat resources determines ecosystem stability and sustainability. Under the framework of ecosystem services related to human wellbeing, we constructed the matching index of water, soil, and heat resources in Central Asia by the vegetation net primary productivity ( NPP) index method based on remote sensing data. We analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of the matching degree in Central Asia, and correlations between the matching degree and climatic factors, water use efficiency using trend analysis and the Hurst index. The results showed that the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources was generally low in Central Asia with a mean value of 9.3. There were obvious differences in the matching degree in different biomes, with the order of alpine forest region > alpine meadow region > typical steppe region > desert steppe region > lake > desert region. From 2000 to 2015, the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources in each biome and in the whole Central Asia showed a fluctuating downward trend. However, the matching degree changed slightly, with relatively poor persistence. There was a large difference and misalignment of spatial variation in temperature and precipitation, which was the main cause of low matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources. The effect of precipitation on the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources in Central Asia was stronger than that of the temperature. There was a strong correlation between the matching degree and water use efficiency in Central Asia.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of the Wide Field View Camera Onboard GaoFen-6 in Multispectral Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen6 (GF-6), successfully launched on June 2, 2018, is the sixth satellite of the High-Definition Earth observation system (HDEOS). Although GF-6 is the first high-resolution satellite in China to achieve precise agricultural observation, it will be widely used in many other domains, such as land survey, natural resources management, emergency management, ecological environment and so on. The GF-6 was not equipped with an onboard calibration instrument, so on-orbit radiometric calibration is essential. This paper aimed at the on-orbit radiometric calibration of the wide field of view camera (WFV) onboard GF-6 (GF-6/WFV) in multispectral bands. Firstly, the radiometric capability of GF-6/WFV is evaluated compared with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8, Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra, which shows that GF-6/WFV has an obvious attenuation. Consequently, instead of vicarious calibration once a year, more frequent calibration is required to guarantee its radiometric consistency. The cross-calibration method based on the Badain Jaran Desert site using the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model calculated by Landsat-8/OLI and ZY-3/Three-Line Camera (TLC) data is subsequently applied to GF-6/WFV and much higher frequencies of calibration are achieved. Finally, the cross-calibration results are validated using the synchronized ground measurements at Dunhuang test site and the uncertainty of the proposed method is analyzed. The validation shows that the relative difference of cross-calibration is less than 5% and it is satisfied with the requirements of cross-calibration.

TI  - Measuring the Urban Land Surface Temperature Variations Under Zhengzhou City Expansion Using Landsat-Like Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing technologies are utilized extensively to investigate urban thermal environment under rapid urban expansion. Current Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are, however, unable to adequately represent the spatially detailed information because of its relatively coarser spatial resolution, while Landsat data cannot explore the temporally continued analysis due to the lower temporal resolution. Combining MODIS and Landsat data, "Landsat-like" data were generated by using the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF) to measure land surface temperature (LST) variations, and Landsat-like data including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built Index (NDBI) were generated to analyze LST dynamic driving forces. Results show that (1) the estimated "Landsat-like" data are capable of measuring the LST variations; (2) with the urban expansion from 2013 to 2016, LST increases ranging from 1.80 degrees C to 3.92 degrees C were detected in areas where the impervious surface area (ISA) increased, while LST decreases ranging from -3.52 degrees C to -0.70 degrees C were detected in areas where ISA decreased; (3) LST has a significant negative correlation with the NDVI and a strong positive correlation with NDBI in summer. Our findings can provide information useful for mitigating undesirable thermal conditions and for long-term urban thermal environmental management.

TI  - Evaluation of Seven Atmospheric Profiles from Reanalysis and Satellite-Derived Products: Implication for Single-Channel Land Surface Temperature Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is vital for studies of hydrology, ecology, climatology, and environmental monitoring. The radiative-transfer-equation-based single-channel algorithm, in conjunction with the atmospheric profile, is regarded as the most suitable one with which to produce long-term time series LST products from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) data. In this study, the performances of seven atmospheric profiles from different sources (the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete atmospheric profile product (MYD07), the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder atmospheric profile product (AIRS), the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/Global Forecasting System (GFS), NCEP/Final Operational Global Analysis (FNL), and NCEP/Department of Energy (DOE)) were comprehensively evaluated in the single-channel algorithm for LST retrieval from Landsat 8 TIR data. Results showed that when compared with the radio sounding profile downloaded from the University of Wyoming (UWYO), the worst accuracies of atmospheric parameters were obtained for the MYD07 profile. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values (approximately 0.5 K) of the retrieved LST when using the ECMWF, MERRA2, NCEP/GFS, and NCEP/FNL profiles were smaller than those but greater than 0.8 K when the MYD07, AIRS, and NCEP/DOE profiles were used. Compared with the in situ LST measurements that were collected at the Hailar, Urad Front Banner, and Wuhai sites, the RMSE values of the LST that were retrieved by using the ECMWF, MERRA2, NCEP/GFS, and NCEP/FNL profiles were approximately 1.0 K. The largest discrepancy between the retrieved and in situ LST was obtained for the NCEP/DOE profile, with an RMSE value of approximately 1.5 K. The results reveal that the ECMWF, MERRA2, NCEP/GFS, and NCEP/FNL profiles have great potential to perform accurate atmospheric correction and generate long-term time series LST products from Landsat TIR data by using a single-channel algorithm.

TI  - GF-3 data real-time processing method based on multi-satellite distributed data processing system
T2  - JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limited scenes that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites can detect, the full-track utilization rate is not high. Because of the computing and storage limitation of one satellite, it is difficult to process large amounts of data of spacebome synthetic aperture radars. It is proposed to use a new method of networked satellite data processing for improving the efficiency of data processing. A multi-satellite distributed SAR real-time processing method based on Chirp Scaling (CS) imaging algorithm is studied in this paper, and a distributed data processing system is built with field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips as the kernel. Different from the traditional CS algorithm processing, the system divides data processing into three stages. The computing tasks are reasonably allocated to different data processing units (i.e., satellites) in each stage. The method effectively saves computing and storage resources of satellites, improves the utilization rate of a single satellite, and shortens the data processing time. Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite SAR raw data is processed by the system, with the performance of the method verified.

TI  - A Novel Polarimetric SAR Classification Method Integrating Pixel-Based and Patch-Based Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images classification method based on residual network (ResNet) and deep autoencoder (DAE) is proposed in this letter. The patch-based classification and pixel-based classification are well integrated to achieve better classification accuracy and clearer contour features. The patch-based classification results with ResNet and pixel-based classification results with DAE are obtained respectively. According to the results, a hybrid method combining the patch-based and the pixel-based classification is developed to determine the category label of each pixel. The attractive feature of the combined method is to take full use of the polarization scattering characteristics in each pixel and spatial information of the polarimetric SAR data. To verify the proposed method, SAR images from Chinese GaoFen 3 (GF-3) space-borne SAR systems are used and experiments are performed, which shows the proposed method can achieve high accuracy and maintain contour features simultaneously. Compared with existing classification methods, the new method has a better performance in classification accuracy and false alarm probability (FAP).

TI  - A Novel Stereo Matching Algorithm for Digital Surface Model (DSM) Generation in Water Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image dense matching has become one of the widely used means for DSM generation due to its good performance in both accuracy and efficiency. However, for water areas, the most common ground object, accurate disparity estimation is always a challenge to excellent image dense matching methods, as represented by semi-global matching (SGM), due to the poor texture. For this reason, a great deal of manual editing is always inevitable before practical applications. The main reason for this is the lack of uniqueness of matching primitives, with fixed size and shape, used by those methods. In this paper, we propose a novel DSM generation method, namely semi-global and block matching (SGBM), to achieve accurate disparity and height estimation in water areas by adaptive block matching instead of pixel matching. First, the water blocks are extracted by seed point growth, and an adaptive block matching strategy considering geometrical deformations, called end-block matching (EBM), is adopted to achieve accurate disparity estimation. Then, the disparity of all other pixels beyond these water blocks is obtained by SGM. Last, the median value of height of all pixels within the same block is selected as the final height for this block after forward intersection. Experiments are conducted on ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) stereo images, and the results show that DSM generated by our method in water areas has high accuracy and visual quality.

TI  - Investigating impacts of drought and disturbance on evapotranspiration over a forested landscape in North Carolina, USA using high spatiotemporal resolution remotely sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystem services such as clean water, wildlife habitat, and timber supplies are increasingly threatened by drought and disturbances (e.g., harvesting, fires and conversion to other uses), which can have great impacts on stand development and water balance. Improved understanding of the hydrologic response of forested systems to drought and disturbance at spatiotemporal resolutions commensurate with these impacts is important for effective forest management. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key hydrologic variable in assessing forest functioning and health, but it remains a challenge to accurately quantify ET at landscape scales with the spatial and temporal detail required for effective decision-making. In this study, we apply a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to study the response of forest ET to drought and disturbance over a 7-year period. This approach combines Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET product time series retrieved using a surface energy balance model to generate a multi-year ET datacube at 30-m resolution and daily timesteps. The study area (similar to 900 km(2)) contains natural and managed forest as well as croplands in the humid lower coastal plains in North Carolina, USA, and the simulation period from 2006 to 2012 includes both normal and severe drought conditions. The model results were evaluated at two AmeriFlux sites (US-NC2 and US-NC1) dominated by a mature and a recently clearcut pine plantation, respectively, and showed good agreement with observed fluxes, with 813% relative errors at monthly timesteps. Changes in water use patterns in response to drought and disturbance as well as forest stand aging were assessed using the remotely sensed time series describing total evapotranspiration, the transpiration (T) component of ET, and a moisture stress metric given by the actual-to-reference ET ratio (f(RET)). Analyses demonstrate differential response to drought by land cover type and stand age, with larger impacts on total ET observed in young pine stands than in mature stands which have substantially deeper rooting systems. Transpiration flux shows a clear ascending trend with the growth of young pine plantations, while stand thinning within the plantation leads to decreases in both remotely sensed leaf area index and T, as expected. Time series maps of f(RET) anomalies at 30-m resolution capture signals of drought, disturbance and the subsequent recovery after clearcut at the stand scale and may be an effective indicator for water use change detection and monitoring in forested landscapes.

TI  - Developing a temporally accurate air temperature dataset for Mainland China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially continuous satellite data have been widely used to estimate monthly air temperature (Ta). However, it is still not clear whether the estimated monthly Ta is temporally consistent with observed Ta or not. In this study, the accuracies of interannual variations and temporal trends in estimated monthly Ta were systematically analyzed for Mainland China during 2001-2018. The differences in accuracy among five ways to input data into the model were investigated. The Cubist algorithm and ten variables were used to estimate monthly Ta. It was found that inputting data for the same month into the model can generate more accurate results than inputting all data into the model. Using temporal variables (i.e., month and year) can significantly increase the accuracy of estimated Ta. These results can be explained by different relationships between Ta and auxiliary variables that appear at different times. Thus, using temporal variables can help distinguish between different relationships and improve accuracy levels of the estimated Ta. When applying the best method (inputting data for the same month into the model and using the year as a temporal variable), the coefficient of determination (R-2) of estimated monthly mean Ta, interannual variations in monthly mean Ta and temporal trends in monthly mean Ta were recorded as 0.997, 0.731 and 0.848, respectively. The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of estimated monthly mean Ta, interannual variations in monthly mean Ta and temporal trends in monthly mean Ta were recorded as 0.629 degrees C, 0.593 degrees C and 0.201 degrees C/decade, respectively. An accurate, national coverage, 1 km spatial resolution and long time series (2001-2018) monthly mean, maximum and minimum Ta dataset was finally developed. The dataset can be of great use to many fields such as climatology, hydrology and ecology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determination of thermal pollution of water resources caused by Neka power plant through processing satellite imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the vastness of the environment, modern methods for its monitoring its behavior and changes are of great importance. The Neka power plant uses the Caspian Sea to cool its machines, and then the return water is discharged directly from the power plant into the sea. So far, no precise, economical method has been provided for detecting thermal pollution in marine resources in the previous studies. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for detection of thermal pollution through remote sensing and satellite imagery. Landsat 8 can calculate the water temperature with the OLI and TIRS sensors. In this study, the water temperature around the Neka power plant was calculated at the eastern channel (the water inlet channel from the sea to the power plant) and the western channel (the water outlet channel from the power plant to the sea) in two different images using the separate window algorithm in MATLAB. The results indicated an increase in the temperature in the western channel. For the western channel, the mean and highest temperatures on May 26, 2015, were 292.7 K and 294.3 K and were 300.5 K and 303.4 K on April 10, 2016. Based on the results, this can have environmental impacts due to water thermal pollution.

TI  - Why the West Could Not Hear Beale Street: Baldwin's World-Sense of Female Sexuality
T2  - HUMANITIES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - While scholars have noted James Baldwin's revisionary and transformative literary approach to social constructions of race, class, gender, and crime, there has been very little conversation in that vein regarding If Beale Street Could Talk (1974). Upon its publication, many critics issued negative reviews of the novel, failing to recognize how Baldwin's view of female sexuality both embraced notions of the body and constructs from an African-centered world-sense. Using a range of theoretical resources from Africana Studies, this paper analyzes how moving beyond Western frameworks regarding knowledge, sexual discourse, and behavior offers a new interpretation of Baldwin's aims that reclaims and re-imagines Black sexual politics.

TI  - Exploring solar and wind energy resources in North Korea with COMS MI geostationary satellite data coupled with numerical weather prediction reanalysis variables
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their potential as a naturally-available clean energy option, the renewable energy resources of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (i.e., North Korea) have rarely been evaluated. Therefore, to estimate the availability of land surface solar irradiance necessary for solar applications and to model available energy potential, physically-based models drawing on Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) data and associated statistics for key atmospheric constituents, were employed. To assess wind energy resources, model output statistics (MOS) were integrated from post-processed Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) variables, thereby removing any systematic bias arising from long-term regression methods. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) served to compare pyranometer- and satellite-sourced solar radiation, under instantaneous (87.90 W m(-2) and 16.84 W m(-2), respectively) and daily 'all sky conditions' (624.98 Wh m(-)(2) d(-1) and 13.89 Wh m(-2) d(-1), respectively). These low values indicate that satellite-based solar irradiance is sufficiently accurate to be used to model future land surface solar energy in North Korea. In the evaluation of wind energy resources, daily wind speeds obtained from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) reanalysis fields showed good accuracy compared to a meteorological tower measurement (RMSE = 0.37 m s(-1) and MBE = 0.24 m s(-1)). In the study region, mean wind energy potential (from 2013-2015) was 3.44 kWh m(-2) d(-1), whereas solar energy potential was slightly lower at 3.36 kWh m(-2) d(-1); this can be attributed to the nation's mountainous terrain and high latitude. Although the region's mountainous terrain may be an obstacle for future development of renewable energy infrastructure, these initial annual mean solar and wind power density results illustrate the significant renewable energy potential of North Korea. This situates the country in a position to promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG #7) of integrating cleaner and more sustainable energy resources through solar and wind power.

TI  - Joint Spatial-spectral Resolution Enhancement of Multispectral Images with Spectral Matrix Factorization and Spatial Sparsity Constraints
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a joint spatial-spectral resolution enhancement technique to improve the resolution of multispectral images in the spatial and spectral domain simultaneously. Reconstructed hyperspectral images (HSIs) from an input multispectral image represent the same scene in higher spatial resolution, with more spectral bands of narrower wavelength width than the input multispectral image. Many existing improvement techniques focus on spatial- or spectral-resolution enhancement, which may cause spectral distortions and spatial inconsistency. The proposed scheme introduces virtual intermediate variables to formulate a spectral observation model and a spatial observation model. The models alternately solve spectral dictionary and abundances to reconstruct desired high-resolution HSIs. An initial spectral dictionary is trained from prior HSIs captured in different landscapes. A spatial dictionary trained from a panchromatic image and its sparse coefficients provide high spatial-resolution information. The sparse coefficients are used as constraints to obtain high spatial-resolution abundances. Experiments performed on simulated datasets from AVIRIS/Landsat 7 and a real Hyperion/ALI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art spatial- and spectral-resolution enhancement methods. The proposed method also worked well for combination of exiting spatial- and spectral-resolution enhancement methods.

TI  - Effects of land cover change on atmospheric and storm surge modeling during typhoon event
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the role of land cover changes on climate and hydrology during typhoon events is vital for coastal hazard mitigation, prevention, as well as the regulation of land cover. To investigate the effects of land cover changes, simulation studies using the WRF model to calculate the meteorological field combined with the Delft3D-FLOW model capable of accurately simulating storm surges were conducted. The accuracy of this modeling approach is guaranteed since the models were validated against available in-situ and satellite measurements during typhoon Rammasun (2014) period. Through comparing simulation results obtained with the MODIS 2001 and the GlobCover 2009 land cover data scenarios, it is found that land cover changes in the study region exert an apparent influence on the atmospheric and storm surge simulations. Notable disagreements exist between the selected two land cover data. Different types of land cover have disparate physical properties, such as roughness length that alters the typhoon-induced wind field simulation results, thus resulting in changes in storm surge simulation results. Determining the impact of land cover changes on atmosphere and storm surge provides clearer insight into the land cover impacts, which is of great benefit to the atmospheric and storm surge models improvement.

TI  - Examining earliest identifiable timing of crops using all available Sentinel 1/2 imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information on crop planting areas is critical for estimating crop production, and earlier crop mapping can benefit decision-making related to crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and food market. Previous efforts generally produce crop planting area maps after harvest and early season cropping information is rarely available. New opportunities emerge with rapid increase in satellite data acquisition and cloud computing platform such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) which can access and process a vast volume of multi-sensor images. Here we aimed to examine earliest identifiable timing (EIT) of major crops (rice, soybean, and corn) and generate early season crop maps independent of within-year field surveys in the Heilongjiang province, one most important province of grain production in China. The Random Forest classifiers were trained based on early season images and field samples in 2017, then were transferred (applied) to corresponding images in 2018 to obtain resultant maps. Six scenarios with different temporal intervals (10d, 15d, 20d, and 30d) and data integration (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1, a total of 16, 450 images) were compared to get the optimal crop maps. The results showed that the Sentinel-2 time series and 10-day composite outperformed in obtaining EITs and crop maps. We found various EITs for the three grain staples. Specifically, rice could be identified in the late transplanting stage (four months before harvest) with F1 score of 0.93, following by corn recognizable in the early heading stage (two months before harvest, with F1 score of 0.92) and soybean in the early pod setting stage (50 days before harvest, with F1 score of 0.91). The crop maps in the EITs based on the classifier transfer approach have comparable accuracies (overall accuracy = 0.91) comparing to the traditional post-season mapping approach based on current year's all available images and samples (overall accuracy = 0.95). This study suggests the potential of growing fine resolution observations for timely monitoring of crop planting area within season, which provides valuable and timely information for different stakeholders and decision makers.

TI  - Ground Deformation of the Chongming East Shoal Reclamation Area in Shanghai Based on SBAS-InSAR and Laboratory Tests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of the economy, land reclamation, as a result of dredged soil, has become an effective measure to alleviate land scarcity in many coastal cities around the world. Chongming East Shoal (CES), a typical reclamation area in Shanghai that is formed by multi-phase reclamation projects, was selected as the study area. The small baseline subset-interferometry synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) method was applied to derive the map of velocity distribution and accumulated deformation with 70 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected from 22 March 2015 to 2 December 2019. In addition, 25 undisturbed soil samples, including dredger fill and underlying soil layers, were collected from five boreholes (maximum depth 55 m) through a field investigation. Laboratory tests were then performed on all soil samples in order to facilitate an understanding of geological features, including the measurement of basic physical properties, cation exchange capacity, compressibility, microscale structure, and pores. The present results show that the whole CES was undergoing differential ground deformation, with a velocity ranging from -47.5 to 34.6 mm/y. Fast (-3.4 mm/y) to slow (-0.3 mm/y) mean subsidence velocities were detected in multi-phase reclamation areas from inland areas to the coastline, and were controlled by building load and geological features of soil layers. Urbanization is the main factor that triggers accelerated subsidence and should receive special attention for reclamation areas that have been finished for a long time (over 20 years in this study). The geological features indicated that poor drainage conditions in offshore soil layers resulted in slow subsidence. The field investigation and laboratory test can be powerful explanatory tools to monitor the results from a mechanical perspective.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Supraglacial Lakes in Southwest Greenland during the 2014-2018 Melt Seasons Based on Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has implications for global sea level rise, and surface meltwater is an important factor that affects the mass balance. Supraglacial lakes (SGLs), which are representative and identifiable hydrologic features of surface meltwater on GrIS, are a means of assessing surface ablation temporally and spatially. In this study, we have developed a robust method to automatically extract SGLs by testing the widely distributed SGLs area-in southwest Greenland (68 degrees 00 ' N-70 degrees 00 ' N, 48 degrees 00 ' W-51 degrees 30 ' W), and documented their dynamics from 2014 to 2018 using Landsat 8 OLI images. This method identifies water using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and then extracts SGLs with morphological and geometrical algorithms. CNN combines spectral and spatial features and shows better water identification results than the widely used adaptive thresholding method (Otsu), and two machine learning methods (Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Our results show that the total SGLs area varied between 158 and 393 km(2) during 2014 to 2018; the area increased from 2014 to 2015, then decreased and reached the lowest point (158.73 km(2)) in 2018, when the most limited surface melting was observed. SGLs were most active during the melt season in 2015 with a quantity of 700 and a total area of 393.36 km(2). The largest individual lake developed in 2016, with an area of 9.30 km(2). As for the elevation, SGLs were most active in the area, with the elevation ranging from 1000 to 1500 m above sea level, and SGLs in 2016 were distributed at higher elevations than in other years. Our work proposes a method to extract SGLs accurately and efficiently. More importantly, this study is expected to provide data support to other studies monitoring the surface hydrological system and mass balance of the GrIS.

TI  - An Approach to the Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Vegetation in the Growing Season in Western China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the implementation of the great western development strategy in 2000, the ecological environment in the western region of China has been significantly improved. In order to explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation coverage in the western region, this paper adopted the method of Maximum Value Composite (MVC) to obtain the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of vegetation on the basis of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spector audiometer (MODIS) data of 2000/2005/2010/2015/2018. Thereafter, the spatio-temporal differentiation characteristics of vegetation in western China were analyzed. The results show that: (1) According to the time characteristics of vegetation coverage in the western region, the average annual NDVI value of vegetation coverage in the growing season in the western region fluctuated between 0.12 and 0.15, among which that of 2000 to 2010 fluctuated more greatly but did not show obvious change trend. (2) Based on Sen trend and Mann-Kendall test analysis, the area of vegetation coverage improvement in the western region from 2000 to 2018 was larger than that of significant vegetation degradation. (3) From the perspective of global autocorrelation coefficient, Moran's I values were all positive from 2000 to 2018, which indicates that the vegetation coverage in the west showed strong positive autocorrelation in each period. According to the average value and coefficient of variation of vegetation coverage, the vegetation coverage was lower in 2000, its internal variation was smaller, and the vegetation coverage increased with time. According to the local spatial autocorrelation analysis, the vegetation coverage levels in different regions varied greatly. (4) The standard deviation ellipse method was used to study the spatial distribution and directional transformation of vegetation. It makes the result more intuitive, and the three levels of gravity center shift, direction shift, and angle shift were considered: the vegetation growth condition in the spatial aggregation area improved in 2015; the standard deviation ellipses in 2000 and 2018 overlapped and shifted eastward, which indicates that the vegetation coverage conditions in the two years were similar and got ameliorated.

TI  - SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE AND FLOOD HAZARD MAPPING IN THE UPSTREAM CITARUM WATERSHED, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the information on the dynamics of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) spatially and temporally related to the causes of flooding in the study area. The dynamics of LULC changes have been derived based on the classification of Landsat imagery for the period between 1990 and 2016. Terrain surface classification (TSC) was proposed as a micro-landform classification approach in this study to create flood hazard assessment and mapping that was produced based on the integration of TSC with a probability map for flood inundation, and flood depth information derived from field observation. TSC as the micro-landform classification approach was derived from SRTM30 DEM data. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data were used to construct a pattern of historical inundation or past flooding in the study area and also to produce the flood probability map. The results of the study indicate that the proposed flood hazard mapping (FHM) from the TSC as a micro-landform classification approach has the same pattern with the results of the integration of historical inundation or previous floods, as well as field investigations in the study area. This research will remain an important benchmark for planners, policymakers and researchers regarding spatial planning in the study area. In addition, the results can provide important input for sustainable land use plans and strategies for mitigating flood hazards.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyze the typology of inundation areas and plankton biodiversity in Paminggir peatland, South Borneo, Indonesia. Typology of inundation was determined by image processing and spatial analysis using supervised classification method from Landsat 1994, 2014, 2019. Plankton biodiversity was determined using purposive sampling in detected inundation from spatial analysis. Some environmental factors like temperature, Ph and DO were also analyzed. Confirmation of the results of spatial analysis of peatland typology made from overall accuracy and Kappa informed 88.48% and 0.8. The typology of permanent inundation decreased by 30% from 1994 to 2019 during the dry period from June to August of the total study area of 43275,584 hectares due to sedimentation, land conversion for settlement, and increase in water weeds. Inundation criteria with duration throughout the year were was categorized as permanent, whereas temporary inundation was tentative even in certain dry season. Plankton index biodiversity in permanent inundation was more varied compared to temporary inundation. Phytoplankton from the freshwater Chrysophyta group was more dominant, while zooplankton from the Nauplius group, which were the natural food for fish larvae always presented in the typology of permanent inundation.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal deforestation in the amazon region has been growing a lot in recent years, the biggest and most worrying advances are within Conservation Units (CUs). This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of three Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN) for the conservation of the forest cover. Therefore, for this research, three RPPNs (Seringal Assuncao, Vale das Antas and Agua Boa) were monitored using the supervised classification of images Landsat 5 and 8, corresponding to the years of creation of each RPPN and 2018. To perform the classification were collected similar to 60 pixels per area of interest (ROI), the classes selected were water, exposed soil and forest. After monitoring the three RPPNs, it was possible to observe an increase between 2% up to 35% of forest cover in the RPPNs. With the monitoring of the RPPNs using the images Landsat it was possible to detect the efficiency of the natural regeneration of the forest cover, as well as the preservation of the native vegetation. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that RPPNs are efficient to contain deforestation. However, further research is still needed in this area, since there are few researches on the monitoring of conservation units in Rondonia as well as in Brazil.

TI  - Optimization Design and Experimental Testing of a Laser Receiver for Use in a Laser Levelling Control System
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The elevation detection accuracy of the laser receiver in the laser levelling control system directly affects land-levelling operations. To effectively improve the effect of levelling operations and meet the requirements for the accuracy of elevation detection in different industries, this study optimization designed a multilevel adjustable laser receiver. First, we examined the laser signal detection technology and processing circuit, designed the photoelectric conversion array for the detection of the rotating laser, and converted it into a photocurrent signal. We also designed the filter, amplifier, and shaping and stretching circuits for analogue-to-digital conversion of the photocurrent signal. The digital signal was calculated based on the deviation of the elevation by using a microprocessor and was output by a controller area network (CAN) bus. The laser beam spot diameter transmission and diffusion were then studied, and with the detectable spot diameters were compared and analyzed. Accordingly, an algorithm was proposed to calculate the deviation of laser receiver elevation. The resolution of the elevation deviation was set to +/- 3 mm; however, this value could be adjusted to +/- 6 mm, +/- 9 mm, +/- 12 mm, and +/- 15 mm, according to the requirements. Finally, the laser receiver was tested and analyzed, and the test results of the elevation detection accuracy showed that when the laser receiver was within a radius of 90 m, the elevation detection accuracy was within the +/- 3 mm range. The outcomes of the farmland-levelling test showed that the standard deviation Sd of the field surface decreased from 9.54 cm before levelling to 2.42 cm after levelling, and the percentage of sampling points associated with absolute errors of <= 3 cm was 84.06%. These outcomes meet the requirements of high-standard farmland construction. The test results of concrete levelling showed that within a radius of 30 m, the standard deviation Sd of the elevation adjustment of the left laser receiver was 1.389 mm, and the standard deviation Sd of the elevation adjustment of the right laser receiver was 1.316 mm. Furthermore, the percentage of the sampling points associated with absolute elevation adjustment errors of <= 3 mm in the cases of the two laser receivers was 100% after levelling, whereas the standard deviation Sd of the sand bed surface was 0.881 mm. Additionally, the percentage of the sampling points associated with absolute errors of <= 3 mm was 100%. This met the construction standards of the concrete industry.

AB  - The paper looks at the work of the Silver Age poet, who entered Russian literature of the twentieth century "as a God who forgot himself' and examines the texts of Maximilian Voloshin to be found at the junction of a literary direction (symbolism) and a method of depicting reality (neorealism). The author shows the spiritual path of Maximilian Voloshin at the "prophetic crossroads" of the turn of the century epoch, when the text and life merged into one and vice versa and displays the poet's myth-making process acting as the essence of his poetic worldview. The latter serves as a pattern, representative of the whole Silver Age era at the same time preserving the originality and uniqueness of his creator s view of the world.

TI  - Estimating Ground-Level Particulate Matter in Five Regions of China Using Aerosol Optical Depth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used to estimate near-surface particulate matter (PM). In this study, ground-measured data from the Campaign on Atmospheric Aerosol Research network of China (CARE-China) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) were used to evaluate the accuracy of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AOD data for different aerosol types. These four aerosol types were from dust, smoke, urban, and uncertain and a fifth "type" was included for unclassified (i.e., total) aerosols. The correlation for dust aerosol was the worst (R-2 = 0.15), whereas the correlations for smoke and urban types were better (R-2 values of 0.69 and 0.55, respectively). The mixed-effects model was used to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Sichuan-Chongqing (SC), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Middle Yangtze River (MYR) using the classified aerosol type and unclassified aerosol type methods. The results suggest that the cross validation (CV) of different aerosol types has higher correlation coefficients than that of the unclassified aerosol type. For example, the R-2 values for dust, smoke, urban, uncertain, and unclassified aerosol types BTH were 0.76, 0.85, 0.82, 0.82, and 0.78, respectively. Compared with the daily PM2.5 concentrations, the air quality levels estimated using the classified aerosol type method were consistent with ground-measured PM2.5, and the relative error was low (most RE was within +/- 20%). The classified aerosol type method improved the accuracy of the PM2.5 estimation compared to the unclassified method, although there was an overestimation or underestimation in some regions. The seasonal distribution of PM2.5 was analyzed and the PM2.5 concentrations were high during winter, low during summer, and moderate during spring and autumn. Spatially, the higher PM2.5 concentrations were predominantly distributed in areas of human activity and industrial areas.

TI  - A mosaic method for multi-temporal data registration by using convolutional neural networks for forestry remote sensing applications
T2  - COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image registration is one of the most important processes for the generation of remote sensing image mosaics. This paper focuses on the special problems related to remote sensing data registration, and multi-temporal data mosaic applications in the domain of forestry. It proposes an image registration method based on hierarchical convolutional features, and applies it to improve the efficiency of large scale forestry image mosaic generation. This method uses a deep learning architecture to adaptively obtain image features from deep convolutional neural networks. The features derived from different images at different depth are sent to a correlation filter to compute the similarity between them; then the locations of the feature points are computed precisely. Based on this method, we study forestry image registration and the mosaic framework. We apply our approach to remote sensing images under different weather and seasonal conditions, and compare the results with those generated using the traditional SIFT image mosaic method. The experimental result shows that our method can detect and match the image feature points with significant spectral difference, and effectively extract feature points to generate accurate image registration and mosaic results. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Towards high resolution flood monitoring: An integrated methodology using passive microwave brightness temperatures and Sentinel synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in flood extent is critical for flood control and mitigation purposes in areas where flooding affects many people and dense infrastructure and properties. Remote sensing can be an effective technique to detect changes in surface water extent and its dynamics. Compared to optical remote sensing, microwave in- formation is suitable for working in any weather condition without severe cloud interference. Usually passive microwave data has a high temporal but a rather coarse spatial resolution, whereas for active microwave data this is reversed and only with ideal satellite constellation observations it can reach high sampling rates. To overcome these spatial and temporal restrictions, we proposed an integrated methodology to combine the passive and active microwave remote sensing and thus provide flood information more frequently at a high resolution. In this paper, a demonstration of the methodology is presented for a flood event occurring in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in July 2016. The major inundation occurred along the Jushui River, part of the Middle Yangtze River basin. Using the brightness temperature data from a special data set (MEaSUREs), a daily passive microwave signal at the resolution of 3.125 km is used as an indicator to monitor flood occurrence and obtain the flood duration over time. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery (12-day revisit, 10-m spatial resolution) from Sentinel-1 was processed to estimate high resolution flood extents within the time span of the flood based on a threshold-based method together with the High Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) index post-processor. Surface water fraction data generated from SAR images presents a strong correlation with the passive microwave signal (R-2 = 0.84) when using a quadratic polynomial fit. The average bias between surface water fraction computed by the passive microwave signals and SAR observations for water pixels within the Jushui River basin for the validation dates is 0.34%, indicating that this relationship can be applied to interpolate surface water fraction for each pixel along the river and other permanent water bodies for days when SAR observations are not available. This integrated method takes advantage of both passive and active microwave remote sensing and enriches temporally sparse flood data. Given the global coverage of the datasets used in this study, it can be utilized to estimate flood status for other flood-prone areas and thus contribute towards societal flood preparedness and response.

TI  - Cloud Characteristics and Radiation Forcing in the Global Land Monsoon Region From Multisource Satellite Data Sets
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global land monsoon region has the highest land cloud amount in the world affecting two thirds of the world's population. Understanding the characteristics of cloud-radiation relies heavily on satellite data set, while few studies have addressed the advantages and weaknesses of current existing satellite data sets in estimating the cloud-radiation characteristics over global land monsoon regions. Multisource satellite data sets are used in this study to show the cloud characteristics in different monsoon regions. We find that all satellite data sets consistently show a peak of cloud fraction, cloud top height and cloud radiation forcing during summer over the global land monsoon regions. A regional difference in cloud characteristics is observed from multisource data sets. The seasonal cycle of cloud amount in the North American monsoon region is relatively smaller than that of the other monsoon regions. High-level clouds dominate the North African monsoon, while Low-level clouds dominate the Asian monsoon. The cloud properties and their radiative forcings revealed by four cloud-parameter data sets with multispectral imagers, that is, International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)-D2, ISCCP-H, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-MYD, and MODIS-MOD, are similar to one another, except stronger short-wave cloud radiative forcing in ISCCP-FD. Multidata comparison confirmed the climate and seasonal cycles of cloud characteristics in this study, demonstrating a better representation of cloud vertical structure in CloudSat over global land monsoon region.

TI  - Applying fungicide on earthworms: Biochemical effects of <i>Eisenia fetida</i> exposed to fluoxastrobin in three natural soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluoxastrobin is one of the most widely used strobilurin fungicides, however, application of the fungicides may result in soil residues leading to environmental damage including oxidative stress and damage to sentinel organisms (i.e. earthworms). While this has been demonstrated in artificial soil, the biochemical response of Eisenia fetida exposed to fluoxastrobin in natural soils is unclear. This study utilized three typical natural soils (fluvo-aquic soils, red clay, and black soils) to evaluate the biochemical response of Eisenia fetida exposed to fluoxastrobin (0.1, 1.0, 2.5 mg/kg) including the production of reactive oxygen species, impact on three enzyme activities, lipid peroxidation, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine after a 4-week exposure. The effects of fluoxastrobin on Eisenia fetida in different soils were assessed using an integrated biomarker response (IBR). The findings may be possible to state that the toxic effects of fluoxastrobin in artificial cannot exactly represent that in natural soils. Specifically, the fluoxastrobin subchronic toxicity was highest in red clay and lowest in black soil among the three natural soils. Furthermore, the 8-OHdG content was more sensitive to fluoxastrobin in all six environmental indicators of the present study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study on the Internal Force of Geomembrane of Landfill in HeavyMetal Contaminated Area
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to analyze the tension stress of Geomembrane in the seepage control system of a landfill in a heavy metal contaminated area under the action of the overlying landfill weight, the internal force of Geomembrane in a landfill is studied in this paper. Firstly, according to the internal force analysis of Geomembrane model, the basic equation of Geomembrane is obtained, and the equation is analyzed by finite difference numerical solution, so as to analyze the internal force of Geomembrane in a landfill. The method can analyze three stress states of Geomembrane-clay interface at different positions: elastic state, softening state and residual state, which makes the stress analysis of Geomembrane on landfill slope more reasonable. Parametric analysis shows that when the strength loss and the difference between residual displacement and peak displacement are small in the softening stage, the peak strength of Geomembrane-clay interface has little influence on the maximum tensile stress of Geomembrane and its residual strength is the main controlling factor, and when the softening characteristics of Geomembrane-clay interface are obvious, the influence of peak strength and residual displacement is more obvious.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection in Quad-Polarimetric SAR Images Using an Advanced Convolutional Neural Network Based on SuperPixel Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill detection plays an important role in marine environment protection. Quad-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been proved to have great potential for this task, and different SAR polarimetric features have the advantages to recognize oil spill areas from other look-alikes. In this paper we proposed an oil spill detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixel. Experiments were conducted on three Single Look Complex (SLC) quad-polarimetric SAR images obtained by Radarsat-2 and Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR). Several groups of polarized parameters, including H/A/Alpha decomposition, Single-Bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (SERD), correlation coefficients, conformity coefficients, Freeman 3-component decomposition, Yamaguchi 4-component decomposition were extracted as feature sets. Among all considered polarimetric features, Yamaguchi parameters achieved the highest performance with total Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 90.5%. It is proved that the SLIC superpixel method significantly improved the oil spill classification accuracy on all the polarimetric feature sets. The classification accuracy of all kinds of targets types were improved, and the largest increase on mean MIoU of all features sets was on emulsions by 21.9%.

TI  - Saliency and Background Prior-Based Residential Area Detection for SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the lack of color, the strong speckle noise, and the complex background clutter, target detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a challengeable task. A novel saliency and background prior (SBP)-based residential area detection method for SAR images is proposed in this letter. It has three major advantages compared with other methods: 1) in saliency analysis, it deeply exploits the image feature and conceives a new texture representation using the amplitude of partitioning Fourier transform (pFT), which compensates for the lack of color and spectrum information in SAR; 2) it employs the superpixel-level background prior and monitors the average intensity level (AIL) of each superpixel for generating accurate outlines of residential areas; and 3) two regional feature-based indices are presented to select the background clutter, and the results serve as a modification to saliency analysis. Experiments using ALOS PALSAR images show that the proposed method has great priority in both quality and quantity over competing methods by extracting integrated residential areas with clear boundaries.

TI  - Stability and transport of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in three variable-charge soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The exposure pathways and environmental impacts of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) released into soils could be significantly influenced by their stability and transport behaviors. The aim of this study was to investigate the stability and transport of TiO2 NPs in three variable-charge soils and to determine the key factors controlling these behaviors. Materials and methods Three surface (0~15 cm) variable-charge soils derived from quaternary red clay, humid ferralsols and stagnic anthrosols collected from Yingtan, Jiangxi Province (YT-H and YT-S, respectively), and humid ferralsols collected from Fuyang, Zhejiang Province (FY-H), were used in this study. Batch sedimentation experiments of TiO2 NPs in soil suspensions were performed for 10 h to quantify their stability. Transport of TiO2 NPs in soil columns was conducted with and without the presence of fulvic acid (FA). Results and discussion Apart from soil organic matter (SOM) and iron oxides, there was no significant difference between the tested soils. Batch experiments showed that TiO2 NPs were more stable in the YT-S soil suspension with high dissolved organic matter than in the YT-H and FY-H soil suspensions. In the column experiments, all TiO2 NPs were retained in YT-H and YT-S, while 11% of the TiO2 NPs were eluted from FY-H with a low amorphous iron oxide content. The significant retention of TiO2 NPs in the soils could be attributed to the straining and adsorption of TiO2 NPs on the surface of soil particles. FA enhanced the transport of TiO2 NPs in YT-H and FY-H by dispersing the TiO2 NPs and reducing their adsorption onto soil particles, while all the TiO2 NPs dispersed in the FA solution were still deposited in YT-S with a high amorphous iron oxide content. Conclusions The stability of TiO2 NPs in three variable-charge soil suspensions was dependent on the SOM. However, the mobility of TiO2 NPs in soils was not directly related to their stability in the soil suspensions. The difference in amorphous iron oxide content could induce the disparity in mobility of TiO2 NPs in soils.

TI  - Using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to Improve the Spatial Coverage of the MODIS Based Reservoir Monitoring Network in South Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of near real-time reservoir storage variations has important implications for flood monitoring and water resources management. However, satellite altimetry data, which are essential for estimating storage variations, are only available for a limited number of reservoirs. This lack of high-density spatial coverage directly hinders the potential use of remotely sensed reservoir information for improving the skills of hydrological modeling over highly regulated river basins. To solve this problem, a reservoir storage dataset with high-density spatial coverage was developed by combining the water surface area estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imageries with the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). By including more reservoirs, this reservoir dataset represents 46.6% of the overall storage capacity in South Asia. The results were validated over five reservoirs where gauge observations are accessible. The storage estimates agree well with observations, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.47 to 0.91 and normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) ranging from 15.46% to 37.69%. Given the general availability of MODIS and SRTM data, this algorithm can be potentially applied for monitoring global reservoirs at a high density.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics and the relations with climate change at multiple time scales in the Yangtze River and Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the vegetation dynamics and their responses to natural and anthropogenic factors plays a key part in improving ecosystem structure and function in the context of global warming. In present study, the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of vegetation coverage and their relationships with climate change at different time scales in the Yangtze River and Yellow River Basin (YZYRB) were analyzed based on the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). The results showed that the growing-season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) increased by 0.011/decade (z = 4.09) during 1982-2015. The areas with significant improvement trend were mainly distributed in the central and eastern Yellow River Basin (YRB) and the central Yangtze River Basin (YZRB), while the east YZRB was significantly degraded. The correlation analysis based on multiple time scales illustrated that as the time scales increased, the response of vegetation to climate variations became more prominent. Especially under the long-term trend, the significance of the correlations between vegetation and precipitation/temperature increased with the area percentage increasing up to 81.5% and 93.62%, respectively. The relationship between GSN and precipitation was mainly driven by climatic conditions and vegetation types at 3-year time scale, altitude and vegetation types for the long-term trend. The relationship between GSN and temperature was mainly related to the climatic conditions and elevation at 3-year time scale, the vegetation types and climatic conditions at 6-year time scale and for the long-term trend. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that the climate change had greater influences on vegetation than that of anthropogenic activities in 50.8% of the study area, which distributed in the central area of the YZYRB.

TI  - Automatic Surface Water Mapping Using Polarimetric SAR Data for Long-Term Change Detection
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the distribution and persistence of surface water in a timely fashion has broad value for tracking dynamic events like flooding, and for monitoring the effects of climate and human activities on natural resource values and biodiversity. Traditionally, surface water is mapped from optical imagery using semi-automatic approaches. However, this process is time-consuming and the accuracy of results can vary among image interpreters. In recent years, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have been increasingly used. Microwave signals sensitive to water content make SAR systems useful for mapping surface water, saturated soils, and flooded vegetation. In this study, a fully automatic method based on robust stepwise thresholding was developed to map and track the change in the extent of surface water using Polarimetric SAR data. The application of this method in both Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 data in central Ontario, Canada demonstrates that the developed robust stepwise thresholding approach could facilitate rapid mapping of open water areas with a promising accuracy of over 95%. In addition, the time-series extent of surface water extracted from May 2008 to August 2016 reveals the dynamic nature of surface inundation, and the trend was consistent with the local precipitation data.

TI  - Quantifying Nutrient Budgets for Sustainable Nutrient Management
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, provide vital support for human life, but overloading nutrients to the Earth system leads to environmental concerns, such as water and air pollution on local scales and climate change on the global scale. With an urgent need to feed the world's growing population and the growing concern over nutrient pollution and climate change, sustainable nutrient management has become a major challenge for this century. To address this challenge, the growing body of research on nutrient budgets, namely the nutrient inputs and outputs of a given system, has provided great opportunities for improving scientific knowledge of the complex nutrient cycles in the coupled human and natural systems. This knowledge can help inform stakeholders, such as farmers, consumers, and policy makers, on their decisions related to nutrient management. This paper systematically reviews major challenges, as well as opportunities, in defining, quantifying, and applying nutrient budgets. Nutrient budgets have been defined for various systems with different research or application purposes, but the lack of consistency in the system definition and its budget terms has hindered intercomparison among studies and experience-sharing among researchers and regions. Our review synthesizes existing nutrient budgets under a framework with five systems (i.e., Soil-Plant system, Animal system, Animal-Plant-Soil system, Agro-Food system, and Landscape system) and four spatial scales (i.e., Plot and Farm, Watershed, National, and Global scales). We define these systems and identify issues of nitrogen and phosphorus budgets within each. Few nutrient budgets have been well balanced at any scale, due to the large uncertainties in the quantification of several major budget terms. The type and level of challenges vary across spatial scales and also differ among nutrients. Improvement in nutrient budgets will rely not only on the technological advancement of scientific observations and models but also on better bookkeeping of human activity data. While some nutrient budget terms may need decades, or even centuries, of research to be well quantified within desirable levels of uncertainties, it is imperative to effectively communicate to interested stakeholders our understanding of nutrient budgets so that scientists and a variety of stakeholders can work together to address the sustainable nutrient management challenge of this century.Plain Language Summary Managing nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is fundamental, yet challenging, for sustainable development. Nutrients are critical for plant and animal growth in agriculture and in nonagricultural ecosystems and are consequently important for food security and climate stability, as well as human health. However, historical and ongoing increases in nutrient inputs to agriculture, while increasing food production, have also contributed to severe environmental problems, ranging from local water and air pollution to global climate change. Quantifying the nutrient inputs and outputs of a farm, watershed, or any other well-defined boundary advances our knowledge of how to maintain a nutrient balance, which is an essential step toward sustainable nutrient management. So far, many research efforts have been devoted to quantifying nutrient budgets and to improving nutrient management for different systems (e.g., farms and food supply chains) and at different spatial scales (e.g., from a single farm to the entire world). However, due to the complex nature of nutrient cycles and incomplete data sets, challenges remain in quantifying and understanding nutrient budgets to inform policies and actions for sustainable nutrient management. With a systematic review of major challenges in defining, quantifying, and applying nutrient budgets, this paper calls for collective efforts by researchers, farmers, watershed managers, consumers, policy makers, and other stakeholders involved in nutrient management to improve our ability to balance nutrient budgets and to use that understanding to grow abundant food while avoiding pollution.

TI  - Development of the Direct-Estimation Albedo Algorithm for Snow-Free Landsat TM Albedo Retrievals Using Field Flux Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anisotropy information from moderate-to-coarse-resolution sensors [e.g., 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)] is widely applied to estimate high-resolution surface albedo. Simulated albedos using MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters as prior knowledge based on the kernel-driven model are employed to build and assess the lookup table (LUT) of the direct-estimation method, which is then used to estimate high-resolution albedos directly from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data (e.g., Landsat albedo). Previously, the errors in the simulated albedos were not considered in building and assessing the LUT. In this article, daytime time-series (30 min) of snow-free albedo measurements with sufficient solar zenith angles (SZAs) were introduced to build the LUT for snow-free Landsat TM surface shortwave broadband albedo (TM albedo) retrievals, together with TOA-simulated reflectance by concurrent daily MODIS BRDF parameters. The assessment utilizes an independent data set and shows larger discrepancies between the estimated and measured albedos [root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of >0.03 at SZAs >= 60 degrees] than those in previous articles. To reduce inconsistencies between the MODIS BRDF parameters and the observed albedos, as well as possible spatial resolution differences between the MODIS and Landsat data, we adopted a correction strategy that first linearly adjusts the MODIS BRDF parameters to match the albedo measurements by a magnitude method, and second, the TOA reflectance simulations were further corrected by concurrent TM reflectances. The developed algorithm shows a significant improvement after using such corrections as a priori (RMSE < 0.02 at SZA <= 75 degrees). The validation indicates improved accuracies in the TM albedo estimation. These improvements may provide potential albedo estimations for nadir-viewing high-resolution sensors using coarse-resolution anisotropy information.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a new algorithm for detecting 30 m land surface phenology from VIIRS and HLS time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) provides critical information for investigating vegetation growth and development, studying ecosystem biodiversity, modeling terrestrial carbon and surface energy budgets, detecting land cover and land use change, and monitoring climate change. Although operational 500 m LSP products have been produced from coarse resolution data observed from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), an LSP product is also needed at the Landsat scale (30 m) to enhance the environmental monitoring and modeling. However, temporal frequency of 30 m satellite data is always inadequate for reliable ISP detection, despite enrichment by the operational harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HIS) product. In this study, we propose a new algorithm of LSP detection for the generation of a 30 m LSP product using routinely produced HLS and VIIRS surface reflectance products. Specifically, the new algorithm compares a HLS EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index) time series at a given 30 m pixel with the set of 500 m VIIRS EVI2 time series neighboring the HLS pixel and selects the most similar temporal shape of VIIRS time series even though the amplitude and/or phase between HLS and VIIRS EVI2 time series may be mismatched. The shape of the selected VIIRS EVI2 time series is then used to match to the given HLS EVI2 time series to generate a synthetic HLS-VIIRS time series. The HLS-VIIRS time series is subsequently processed using the hybrid piecewise logistic model to detect the phenological transition dates and to quantify the confidence of LSP detection. This new algorithm is evaluated by implementing 30 m LSP detection in eight HLS tiles in the northeastern (forests), central (croplands), and western (shrublands) United States. Evaluation finds that the new-algorithm-detected greenup onset (1) agrees well with the standard VIIRS LSP product without bias, (2) closely correlates to PhenoCam observations with a slope close to one, and (3) compares well with both PhenoCam and field species-specific observations with a mean absolute difference of 8 days and a difference less than 10 days in more than 70% of the validation samples. This implementation suggests that the new algorithm could be implemented for regional and global LSP product generation at a 30 m resolution.

TI  - Observation of internal waves with OLCI and SRAL on board Sentinel-3
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) and synthetic aperture radar altimeter (SRAL) installed aboard the Sentinel-3 satellite have been in orbit for operational uses. In this study, data collected from Sentinel-3 are used to investigate internal waves in the South China Sea. An internal wave is detected using an OLCI image with a resolution of 300 m, and an analysis was performed with a quasi-synchronous moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) image. The opposite characteristics of OLCI and MODIS images of the same internal wave are explained by the critical angle in brightness reversals. The unique observational geometry of the OLCI image and its influence on observations of internal waves are discussed. The distribution of sigma(0) and sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) induced by internal waves are studied using SRAL records. The sigma(0) records of SRAL occasionally show less sensitivity to the modulation of internal waves, which may be attributed to the observational geometry, while SSHAs show obvious variations. The synchronous pairing of OLCI images and SRAL records are analyzed to extract the three-dimensional sea surface signatures induced by internal waves. The analysis demonstrates that the profile of SSHAs in the surface shows an opposite phase to the profiles of internal waves in the ocean. The opposite phase relationship, observed in the remote sensing view, is also confirmed with a laboratory experiment.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Variations and Trends in Carbon Monoxide over Asia and Their Sensitivities to Biomass Burning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the carbon monoxide (CO) total column over Asia is among the highest in the world, it is important to characterize its variations in space and time. Using Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) satellite data, the variations and trends in CO total column over Asia and its seven subregions during 2003-2017 are investigated in this study. The CO total column in Asia is higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. The seasonal maximum and minimum are in spring and summer respectively in the regional mean over Asia, varying between land and oceans, as well as among the subregions. The CO total column in Asia shows strong interannual variation, with a regional mean coefficient of variation of 5.8% in MOPITT data. From 2003 to 2017, the annual mean of CO total column over Asia decreased significantly at a rate of (0.58 +/- 0.15)% per year (or -(0.11 +/- 0.03) x 10(17) molecules cm(-2) per year) in MOPITT data, resulting from significant CO decreases in winter, summer, and spring. In most of the subregions, significant decreasing trends in CO total column are also observed, more obviously over areas with high CO total column, including eastern regions of China and the Sichuan Basin. The regional decreasing trends in these areas are over 1% per year. Over the entire Asia, and in fire-prone subregions including South Siberia, Indo-China Peninsula, and Indonesia, we found significant correlations between the MOPITT CO total column and the fire counts from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The variations in MODIS fire counts may explain 58%, 60%, 36%, and 71% of the interannual variation in CO total column in Asia and these three subregions, respectively. Over different land cover types, the variations in biomass burning may explain 62%, 52%, and 31% of the interannual variation in CO total column, respectively, over the forest, grassland, and shrubland in Asia. Extremes in CO total column in Asia can be largely explained by the extreme fire events, such as the fires over Siberia in 2003 and 2012 and over Indonesia in 2006 and 2015. The significant decreasing trends in MODIS fire counts inside and outside Asia suggest that global biomass burning may be a driver for the decreasing trend in CO total column in Asia, especially in spring. In general, the variations and trends in CO total column over Asia detected by AIRS are similar to but smaller than those by MOPITT. The two datasets show similar spatial and temporal variations in CO total column over Asia, with correlation coefficients of 0.86-0.98 in the annual means. This study shows that the interannual variation in atmospheric CO in Asia is sensitive to biomass burning, while the decreasing trend in atmospheric CO over Asia coincides with the decreasing trend in MODIS fire counts from 2003 to 2017.

TI  - Estimation of Shortwave Solar Radiation on Clear-Sky Days for a Valley Glacier with Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) is the main energy source for most glacial melting, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data have been used extensively in the inversion of input parameters for estimating DSSR. However, for valley glaciers under complex climatic conditions, the values of MODIS atmospheric products, especially aerosol products, are often invalid, and TM images are always saturated with snow. Furthermore, an estimation model based on optical satellite images must simultaneously consider terrain and atmospheric effects and the transient nature of ice/snow albedo. Based on a high-resolution (12 m) digital elevation model (DEM), the newly launched Sentinel-2 satellites, rather than MODIS and TM, were used to provide input data for our published mountain radiation scheme in a valley glacier. Considering Laohugou Glacier No. 12 as the study area, 62 typical Sentinel-2 scenes were selected and spatiotemporal DSSR variations on the glacier surface were obtained with a 10 m spatial resolution during a mass-balance year from September 2017 to August 2018. Ground-based measurements on 52 clear-sky days were used for validation and the mean bias error (MBE = -16.0 W/m(2)) and root-mean-square difference (RMSD = 73.6 W/m(2)) were relatively low. The results confirm that DSSR is affected mainly by the solar zenith angle and atmospheric attenuation in flat areas of valley glaciers, while in areas with complex terrain, the DSSR received by the glacier surface is affected primarily by the terrain and ice/snow albedo, which exhibits very high spatial heterogeneity.

TI  - Quantifying Information Content in Multispectral Remote-Sensing Images Based on Image Transforms and Geostatistical Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying information content in remote-sensing images is fundamental for information-theoretic characterization of remote sensing information processes, with the images being usually information sources. Information-theoretic methods, being complementary to conventional statistical methods, enable images and their derivatives to be described and analyzed in terms of information as defined in information theory rather than data per se. However, accurately quantifying images' information content is nontrivial, as information redundancy due to spectral and spatial dependence needs to be properly handled. There has been little systematic research on this, hampering wide applications of information theory. This paper seeks to fill this important research niche by proposing a strategy for quantifying information content in multispectral images based on information theory, geostatistics, and image transformations, by which interband spectral dependence, intraband spatial dependence, and additive noise inherent to multispectral images are effectively dealt with. Specifically, to handle spectral dependence, independent component analysis (ICA) is performed to transform a multispectral image into one with statistically independent image bands (not spectral bands of the original image). The ICA-transformed image is further normal-transformed to facilitate computation of information content based on entropy formulas for Gaussian distributions. Normal transform facilitates straightforward incorporation of spatial dependence in entropy computation for the aforementioned double-transformed image bands with inter-pixel spatial correlation modeled via variograms. Experiments were undertaken using Landsat ETM+ and TM image subsets featuring different dominant land cover types (i.e., built-up, agricultural, and hilly). The experimental results confirm that the proposed methods provide more objective estimates of information content than otherwise when spectral dependence, spatial dependence, or non-normality is not accommodated properly. The differences in information content between image subsets obtained with ETM+ and TM were found to be about 3.6 bits/pixel, indicating the former's greater information content. The proposed methods can be adapted for information-theoretic analyses of remote sensing information processes.

TI  - The 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 5.9 Menyuan Earthquake in the Qilian Orogen, China: A Potentially Delayed Depth-Segmented Rupture Following from the 1986 <i>M</i>w 6.0 Menyuan Earthquake
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An M-w 5.9 thrust earthquake occurred on 21 January 2016 in the northeastern Tibetan plateau, where another similar earthquake had ruptured in 1986. Because of the complexity and close proximity of multiple faults in this area, the exact causative fault sources for these two events have not previously been determined. We determined the seismogenic fault structural geometry of the 2016 event by analyzing the coseismic deformation from Sentinel-1A images, aftershock relocations, and geological data. Furthermore, field investigations and the relocated aftershocks for the 1986 event were used to investigate its seismogenic fault and relation with the 2016 Menyuan earthquake. The results indicate that the reverse slip of both events was distributed on the southwest-dipping Minyue-Damaying fault, where the 2016 event ruptured the deep segment and the 1986 event ruptured the shallow segment. We envision that the depth segmentation played an important role in the occurrence of two moderate earthquakes rupturing the same active fault but separated by almost 30 yr, which is thought much shorter than the average earthquake recurrence cycle. Our study indicates that seismic risks could be underestimated if depth segmentation is not considered.

TI  - Estimating soil organic carbon and pH in Jilin Province using Landsat and ancillary data
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides possibilities to support digital soil mapping at large scales, but this technology over complex landscapes is still challenging due to the high spatial heterogeneity of soil properties. The objective of this work was to check the predictive capability of SOC and soil pH over different ecoregions. First, we collected a series of satellite images from 2017 and ancillary variables (e.g., climate and terrain) as spectral and environmental indicators, respectively. A total of 201 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) from the Northeastern Black Soil Region of China were also used. Then, the relationships between the two soil properties and indicators were analyzed. The indicators that showed significant correlation with SOC or soil pH were involved in the subsequent models. Finally, the SOC and soil pH prediction models were constructed by using a stepwise regression model. The results showed that the visible and shortwave infrared bands, along with the thermal infrared band, had strong correlations with the two soil properties. Environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, and elevation all had an impact on the distribution of SOC and soil pH. The SOC and soil pH prediction models had R-2 values of 0.66 and 0.73, root mean square errors of 0.21 and 0.58, and residual prediction deviations of 1.46 and 1.53, respectively, indicating reliable precision and average prediction abilities. This approach to estimating SOC and soil pH can contribute to improving our understanding and the modeling of soil processes at a large scale and in areas with relatively complex landscapes.

TI  - Influence of mulched drip irrigation on landscape scale evapotranspiration from farmland in an arid area
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-saving irrigation measures in arid areas affect evapotranspiration (ET) processes while conserving water. Mulched drip irrigation is considered the most efficient irrigation method because it distributes water uniformly in the soil, restricts deep percolation, and minimizes unproductive evaporation from soil. The effect of mulched drip irrigation on farmland ET during the growing season at a landscape scale remains unclear, despite being vital for developing optimal water resource management strategies in arid areas. To compare the effects of mulched drip irrigation and mulched border irrigation on ET, based on Landsat satellite imagery (2007-2009 with mulched border irrigation, and 2014-2016 with mulched drip irrigation), an improved Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model was used to evaluate ET for the two periods of an oasis at Sangong River Basin in the arid region of Northwest China. The results show that daily ET rates from farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation were on average 0.2-1 mm.d(-1) higher than under mulched border irrigation between June and August. Correspondingly, the net radiation flux (R) increased 73.32 W.m(-2) on average, and R was found to be the main determinant of the ET differences. Meanwhile, the average land surface albedo decreased by 20%, and negatively correlated with R (P < 0.05), indicating that the land surface albedo was the main factor affecting R. Furthermore, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) exhibited a significant correlation with land surface albedo. More importantly, the Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) under mulched drip irrigation was found to be approximately 21% lower than that under mulched border irrigation, indicating that the soil moisture conditions of the farmland under mulched drip irrigation was significantly improved compared to mulched border irrigation. Namely, less water stress resulted in better developed canopy of the crops, which in turn captured more radiation and thus increased ET. In the end, the observed increases in landscape-scale ET under mulched drip irrigation in arid area resulted from enhanced productivity of the crops due to lessened drought stress.

TI  - A Novel Change Detection Method Based on Statistical Distribution Characteristics Using Multi-Temporal PolSAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsupervised change detection approaches, which are relatively straightforward and easy to implement and interpret, and which require no human intervention, are widely used in change detection. Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), which has an all-weather response capability with increased polarimetric information, is a key tool for change detection. However, for PolSAR data, inadequate evaluation of the difference image (DI) map makes the threshold-based algorithms incompatible with the true distribution model, which causes the change detection results to be ineffective and inaccurate. In this paper, to solve these problems, we focus on the generation of the DI map and the selection of the optimal threshold. An omnibus test statistic is used to generate the DI map from multi-temporal PolSAR images, and an improved Kittler and Illingworth algorithm based on either Weibull or gamma distribution is used to obtain the optimal threshold for generating the change detection map. Multi-temporal PolSAR data obtained by the Radarsat-2 sensor over Wuhan in China are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results using our approach obtained the best performance in East Lake and Yanxi Lake regions with false alarm rates of 1.59% and 1.80%, total errors of 2.73% and 4.33%, overall accuracy of 97.27% and 95.67%, and Kappa coefficients of 0.6486 and 0.6275, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method is more suitable than the other compared methods for multi-temporal PolSAR data, and it can obtain both effective and accurate results.

TI  - Ecological water conveyance drives human-water system evolution in the Heihe watershed, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds are coupled with human-water systems where human, and water resources interact and coevolve with each other. Restoration management not only affects the ecosystem itself but also alters the mutual feedback relationship between humans and water, resulting in additional effects and impeding the ecological restoration process. Taking the lower reaches of the Heihe River as an example (Inner Mongolia, PR China), this study investigated the evolution of the human-water system after the implementation of ecological water conveyance using multiple data sources (e.g., remote sensing data, hydrological data, field data and socioeconomic data). We found that (1) after the implementation of ecological water conveyance, vegetation recovered in the last 15 years with an NDVI increasing from 0.10 to 0.13 across the region except some degraded areas near the river; (2) besides restoring the target ecosystem, ecological water conveyance also promoted socioeconomic development and affected the water resources utilization; (3) after 15 years' water conveyance, the coupled human-water system changed from the early ecological water deficit to the present ecological-socioeconomic water-use trade-off with negative impact resulted from agriculture expansion and water usage conflict between the middle and the lower reaches. These effects impeded the restoration of the ecological environment and aggravated the conflicts of water resources utilization within the whole Heihe watershed, consistent with of the hypothesized disturbance effect transmutation. Our results highlighted that analysis on the mutual feedback effect in the coupled human-water system, and dynamic adjustments for restoration measures are needed for sustainable watershed management.

TI  - Predicting Wheat Yield at the Field Scale by Combining High-Resolution Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery and Crop Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of crop yield at the field scale is critical to addressing crop production challenges and reducing the impacts of climate variability and change. Recently released Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data with a return cycle of five days and a high resolution at 13 spectral bands allows close observation of crop phenology and crop physiological attributes at field scale during crop growth. Here, we test the potential for indices derived from S2 data to estimate dryland wheat yields at the field scale and the potential for enhanced predictability by incorporating a modelled crop water stress index (SI). Observations from 103 study fields over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons across Northeastern Australia were used. Vegetation indices derived from S2 showed moderately high accuracy in yield prediction and explained over 70% of the yield variability. Specifically, the red edge chlorophyll index (CI; chlorophyll) (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 0.88 t/ha) and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI; structural) (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.91 t/ha) showed the best correlation with field yields. Furthermore, combining the crop model-derived SI with both structural and chlorophyll indices significantly enhanced predictability. The best model with combined OSAVI, CI and SI generated a much higher correlation, with R-2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 0.54 t/ha. When validating the models on an independent set of fields, this model also showed high correlation (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.64 t/ha). This study demonstrates the potential of combining S2-derived indices and crop model-derived indices to construct an enhanced yield prediction model suitable for fields in diversified climate conditions.

TI  - Developing Non-Negative Spatial Autoregressive Models for Better Exploring Relation Between Nighttime Light Images and Land Use Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the relationship between nighttime light and land use is of great significance to understanding human nighttime activities and studying socioeconomic phenomena. Models have been studied to explain the relationships, but the existing studies seldom consider the spatial autocorrelation of night light data, which leads to large regression residuals and an inaccurate regression correlation between night light and land use. In this paper, two non-negative spatial autoregressive models are proposed for the spatial lag model and spatial error model, respectively, which use a spatial adjacency matrix to calculate the spatial autocorrelation effect of light in adjacent pixels on the central pixel. The application scenarios of the two models were analyzed, and the contribution of various land use types to nighttime light in different study areas are further discussed. Experiments in Berlin, Massachusetts and Shenzhen showed that the proposed methods have better correlations with the reference data compared with the non-negative least-squares method, better reflecting the luminous situation of different land use types at night. Furthermore, the proposed model and the obtained relationship between nighttime light and land use types can be utilized for other applications of nighttime light images in the population, GDP and carbon emissions for better exploring the relationship between nighttime remote sensing brightness and socioeconomic activities.

TI  - An Improved Descalloping Method Combined With Imaging Parameters for GaoFen-3 ScanSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the specific working mechanism of alternately transmitting and receiving signals between multiple adjacent swaths, scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) will cause periodical wavelike modulation of the intensity image along azimuth direction, which is known as scalloping. Conventional descalloping methods are achieved by proper azimuth antenna pattern (AAP) correction and multi-looking techniques but are limited by the accuracy of Doppler centroid estimating and the thermal noise. Another type of method extracts and suppresses the scalloping texture on the image, but the scanning parameters of ScanSAR are insufficiently considered. The period of scalloping on the image is related to the period of switching between subswathes. While the harmonics can be calculated by the period of a periodic signal, an improved frequency filtering method combined with imaging parameters is proposed. The scalloping modulation model of ScanSAR combined with imaging parameters is constructed, and the harmonics of scalloping texture are accurately calculated and filtered. For the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) image, the antenna pattern is modified according to SNR to avoid scalloping caused by noise. For non-uniform scenes, scalloping suppression is achieved by using the scalloping features acquired by uniform scenes. To separate the non-uniform scenes from uniform scenes, we still use the characteristics of harmonics caused by scalloping. Our descalloping method achieves accurate suppression of scalloping without sea-land segmentation and ship mask and the residual scalloping is reduced from 1.0 to 0.3-0.5 dB. The residual scalloping and statistical characteristics of the image are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Doubly Curved Reflectarray for Dual-Band Multiple Spot Beam Communication Satellites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The design, manufacturing, and testing of a 0.65 m doubly curved polarization selective reflectarray for dual-band multiple spot beam communication satellites in Ka-band is presented. The configuration is based on a single-offset reflectarray consisting of rotated split hexagonal-loop dipole elements printed on a single-layer substrate. For right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), the reflectarray scans the reflected beam half a beamwidth in one direction, and for left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), the reflectarray scans the reflected beam half a beamwidth in the opposite direction. This is achieved in both transmit (Tx) (17.7-20.2 GHz) and receive (Rx) (27.5-29.3 GHz) frequency bands. Using a feeding array with 22 feeds, 41 beams over the Earth can be generated, permitting to cover the entire Earth coverage from a geostationary satellite employing the 4-color frequency/polarization reuse scheme using only two reflectarrays while maintaining single-feed-per-beam operation. The reflectarray has been manufactured and measured, and an excellent agreement between simulated and measured patterns is obtained, thus validating the proposed concept.

TI  - Characteristics of Seasonal Influenza Virus Activity in a Subtropical City in China, 2013-2019
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To optimize seasonal influenza vaccination programs in regions with potentially complicated seasonal patterns, the epidemiological characteristics of seasonal influenza activity in a subtropical city of China were explored. Materials and Methods: Influenza virus data of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) during 2013-2019 were collected from two sentinel hospitals in a subtropical region of China, Yichang city. The influenza virus positive rate among sampled ILI cases served as a proxy to estimate influenza seasonal characteristics, including periodicity, duration, peaks, and predominant subtypes/lineages. Epidemiological features of different years, seasons and age groups were analyzed, and vaccine mismatches were identified. Results: In total, 8693 ILI cases were included; 1439 (16.6%) were laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. The influenza A positive rate (10.6%) was higher than the influenza B positive rate (5.9%). There were three influenza circulation patterns in Yichang: (1) annual periodicity (in 2013-2014, 2015-2016 and 2018-2019), (2) semiannual periodicity (in 2014-2015), and (3) year-round periodicity (in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Summer epidemics existed in two of the six years and were dominated by influenza A/H3N2. Winter and spring epidemics occurred in five of the six years, and A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata were codominant. During the study period, the predominant lineages, B/Victoria in 2015-16 and B/Yamagata in 2017-2018, were both mismatched with the influenza B component of the trivalent vaccine. Children 5-14 years old (26.4%) and individuals over 60 years old (16.9%) had the highest influenza positive rates. Conclusions: The seasonal epidemic period and the predominant subtype/lineage of influenza viruses in Yichang city are complex. Influenza vaccination timing and strategies need to be optimized according to the local features of influenza virus activity.

TI  - Understanding and Modeling Climate Impacts on Photosynthetic Dynamics with FLUXNET Data and Neural Networks
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming, which largely results from excessive carbon emission, has become an increasingly heated international issue due to its ever-detereorating trend and the profound consequences. Plants sequester a large amount of atmospheric CO2 via photosynthesis, thus greatly mediating global warming. In this study, we aim to model the temporal dynamics of photosynthesis for two different vegetation types to further understand the controlling factors of photosynthesis machinery. We experimented with a feedforward neural network that does not utilize past histories, as well as two networks that integrate past and present information, long short-term memory and transformer. Our results showed that one single climate driver, shortwave radiation, carries the most information with respect to prediction of upcoming photosynthetic activities. We also demonstrated that photosynthesis and its interactions with climate drivers, such as temperature, precipitation, radiation, and vapor pressure deficit, has an internal system memory of about two weeks. Thus, the predictive model could be best trained with historical data over the past two weeks and could best predict temporal evolution of photosynthesis two weeks into the future.

TI  - Retrieving Volcanic Ash Top Height through Combined Polar Orbit Active and Geostationary Passive Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking advantage of both the polar orbit active remote sensing data (from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization-CALIOP) and vertical information and the geostationary passive remote sensing measurements (from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) with large coverage, a methodology is developed for retrieving the volcanic ash cloud top height (VTH) from combined CALIOP and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data. This methodology is a deep-learning-based algorithm through hybrid use of Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder (SDA), the Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR). A series of eruptions over Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano from April to May 2010 and the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex eruptions in Chilean Andes in June 2011 were selected as typical cases for independent validation of the VTH retrievals under various meteorological backgrounds. It is demonstrated that using the hybrid deep learning algorithm, the nonlinear relationship between satellite-based infrared (IR) radiance measurements and the VTH can be well established. The hybrid deep learning algorithm not only performs well under a relatively simple meteorological background but also is robust under more complex meteorological conditions. Adding atmospheric temperature vertical profile as additional information further improves the accuracy of VTH retrievals. The methodology and approaches can be applied to the measurements from the advanced imagers onboard the new generation of international geostationary (GEO) weather satellites for retrieving the VTH science product.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of land disturbance based on Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a new algorithm for COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) using Landsat time series. COLD can detect many kinds of land disturbance continuously as new images are collected and provide historical land disturbance maps retrospectively. To better detect land disturbance, we tested different kinds of input data and explored many time series analysis techniques. We have several major observations as follows. First, time series of surface reflectance provides much better detection results than time series of Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and with some adjustments to the temporal density, time series from Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is better than it is from the same Landsat scene. Second, the combined use of spectral bands is always better than using a single spectral band or index, and if all the essential spectral bands have been employed, the inclusion of other indices does not further improve the algorithm performance. Third, the remaining outliers in the time series can be removed based on their deviation from model predicted values based on probability-based thresholds derived from normal or chi-squared distributions. Fourth, model initialization is pivotal for monitoring land disturbance, and a good initialization stability test can influence algorithm performance substantially. Fifth, time series model estimation with eight coefficients model, updated for every single observation, based on all available clear observations achieves the best result. Sixth, a change probability of 0.99 (chi-squared distribution) with six consecutive anomaly observations and a mean included angle < 45 degrees to confirm a change provide the best results, and the combined use of temporally-adjusted Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and minimum RMSE is recommended. Finally, spectral changes (or "breaks") contributed from vegetation regrowth should be excluded from land disturbance maps. The COLD algorithm was developed and calibrated based on all these lessons learned above. The accuracy assessment shows that COLD results were accurate for detecting land disturbance, with an omission error of 27% and a commission error of 28%.

TI  - Improving the Estimation of Water Level over Freshwater Ice Cover using Altimetry Satellite Active and Passive Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to its temporal resolution of 10-day and its polar orbit allowing several crossings over large lakes, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) missions including Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1/2/3 demonstrated strong capabilities for the continuous and long-term monitoring (starting in 1992) of large and medium-sized water bodies. However, the presence of heterogeneous targets in the altimeter footprint, such as ice cover in boreal areas, remains a major issue to obtain estimates of water level over subarctic lakes of similar accuracy as over other inland water bodies using satellite altimetry (i.e., R >= 0.9 and RMSE <= 10 to 20 cm when compared to in-situ water stages). In this study, we aim to automatically identify the Jason-2 altimetry measurements corresponding to open water, ice and transition (water-ice) to improve the estimations of water level during freeze and thaw periods using only the point measurements of open water. Four Canadian lakes were selected to analyze active (waveform parameters) and passive (brightness temperature) microwave data acquired by the Jason-2 radar altimetry mission: Great Slave Lake, Lake Athabasca, Lake Winnipeg, and Lake of the Woods. To determine lake surface states, backscattering coefficient and peakiness at Ku-band derived from the radar altimeter waveform and brightness temperature at 18.7 and 37 GHz measured by the microwave radiometer contained in the geophysical data records (GDR) of Jason-2 were used in two different unsupervised classification techniques to define the thresholds of discrimination between open water and ice measurements. K-means technique provided better results than hierarchical clustering based upon silhouette criteria and the Calinski-Harabz index. Thresholds of discrimination between ice and water were validated with the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover products of the MODIS satellite. The use of open water threshold resulted in improved water level estimation compared to in situ water stages, especially in the presence of ice. For the four lakes, the Pearson coefficient (r) increased on average from about 0.8 without the use of the thresholds to more than 0.90. The unbiased RMSE were generally lower than 20 cm when the threshold of open water was used and more than 22 cm over smaller lakes, without using the thresholds.

TI  - Using MODIS data to analyse the ecosystem water use efficiency spatial-temporal variations across Central Asia from 2000 to 2014
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to understand the carbon-water cycle, which accurately reflects the temporal and spatial variabilities in ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE). In this study, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to study the variabilities in the spatial patterns of the gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration and WUE across Central Asia [the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XJ) in China (CHN), Kazakhstan (KAZ), Turkmenistan (TKM), Uzbekistan (UZB), Kyrgyzstan (KGZ), and Tajikistan (TJK)] from 2000 to 2014. We compared the change results by country, land cover type, population density, and human influence. In addition, the results of GPP, evapotranspiration (ET), and WUE parameter tests were combined and classified to analyse the causes of the changes in WUE. The results showed that (1) the time series of GPP, ET and WUE exhibited no significant changes. The spatial distribution of the WUE exhibited significant increases in the northern part of KAZ, the Ili Valley and the alpine region in KGZ and exhibited decreases in south Xinjiang and the irrigated area of UZB. (2) The main land cover types that exhibited changes in WUE were farmlands and grasslands, and areas with a medium population density exhibited large WUE changes. (3) The increased WUE resulted from an increased GPP and decreased ET. The increased GPP was because of increased precipitation and the Green for Grain Project, and the decreased ET was due to the response of vegetation to drought stress; the decreased WUE was mainly caused by changes in the crops planted and unreasonable water use practices in the irrigated agricultural areas in Central Asia. This study, which is based on the variabilities in WUE spatial patterns, should provide a theoretical basis for ecosystems in arid land areas.

TI  - Application of the Z1071 criteria: classification of axillary lymph nodes on ultrasound after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in initially node-positive breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ULTRASONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1071 trial assessed the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsies in clinically node-positive patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Axillary ultrasound (US) images after NAC were reviewed, and the accuracy of classifying nodes into six types according to the ACOSOG Z1071 trial was determined. Methods This study included 69 patients who underwent NAC followed by curative surgery for breast cancer including axillary lymph node dissection between January 2010 and July 2019. All patients were pathologically confirmed as being initially node positive. Lymph nodes were retrospectively classified into one of six types based on the appearance of the nodal cortex and hilum. Types I and II were classified as having normal nodal morphology, whereas types III, IV, V, and VI were classified as having suspicious nodal morphology. These node types on US images after NAC were compared between patients with an axillary complete response (Ax-pCR) and those with residual metastatic lymph nodes (Ax-non-pCR) using Chi-square tests. Results Twenty-four (35%) of the 69 patients achieved Ax-pCR. Patients with nodes classified as type I or II were more likely to achieve Ax-pCR (83% vs. 36%, p = 0. 0002). Conclusion The classification of six node types was associated with nodal status.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover in Irrigated Drylands: a Long-Term Analysis of Changes in the Mendoza and Tunuyan River Basins, Argentina (1986-2018)
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Processes of agricultural expansion and retreat have provoked an emerging global debate and driven more focused research, due to its socio-environmental consequences. This paper evaluates large-scale LU/LC changes over 32 years from 1986 to 2018 at eight-year increments, based on freely available Landsat imagery processed with open-source QGIS tos. The results are the first quantification of surface areas and fine-grained maps of long-term LU/LC changes in the region. Results indicate marked cropland expansion in the upper Tunuyan River basin while in the lower Tunuyan River basin, small cultivated plots were abandoned. In the Mendoza River basin, there was significant urban expansion onto previously cultivated land but cropland did expand in some areas. The analysis suggests three main drivers of LU/LC change: abandonment of vineyards and orchards in the lower Tunuyan River basin, vineyard expansion in the upper Tunuyan River basin, and peri-urbanization in the Mendoza River basin.

TI  - Effect of Red-Edge Region in Fuzzy Classification: A Case Study of Sunflower Crop
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based crop mapping using multispectral temporal images is a reliable source of crop status information. Reflectance in red-edge region can be incorporated in vegetation indices for better results as it heavily depends upon chlorophyll content in the leaves. This research work studies the effect of three Sentinel-2 red-edge bands on fuzzy classification of sunflower crop in Shahabad, Haryana, India. Fuzzy set theory was introduced in the image processing for handling the mixed pixel problems. Supervised modified possibilistic c-means (MPCM) classification approach has been adopted for the identification of sunflower fields due to the capability of handling outliers, noises, extraction of single crop and coincident cluster problem. Classification approach was applied on four different modified temporal vegetation indices. The modified vegetation indices are generated by taking different combinations of red and red-edge reflectance bands in a controlled manner with NIR band. The best vegetation index and suitable red-edge band for the discrimination of sunflower crop were determined. Further, optimization of temporal date images to separate mapping of early sown, middle sown and late sown fields was also identified. From the results of this study, it has been proven that for temporal datasets red-edge-based indices are better than the standard indices for distinguishing between different crops while applying the MPCM classification method.

TI  - Relationship between hydroclimatic variables and reservoir wetland landscape pattern indices: A case study of the Sanmenxia Reservoir wetland on the Yellow River, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir construction has led to the development of numerous wetlands, and these wetlands play an important role in global environmental change. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between reservoir wetlands and hydroclimatic variables. We used the MODIS land cover product to extract the wetland area of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, China. Then, various indices of reservoir wetland landscape patterns were calculated. Principal component analysis was performed to build the Sanmenxia Reservoir wetland comprehensive landscape pattern index (CLPI) to depict the changes in Sanmenxia Reservoir wetlands from 2001 to 2013. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess their relationship. The following results were obtained. Firstly, the Sanmenxia Reservoir wetland area considerably declined and the landscape heterogeneity decreased from 2001 to 2013, especially in 2004. Secondly, the CLPI is significantly negatively correlated with annual runoff and significantly positively correlated with annual sediment discharge, annual average water level and annual shallow groundwater table in Sanmenxia Reservoir regions. Additionally, due to the decline in the reservoir wetland area, the values of Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's diversity index decreased in the study area. Therefore, the study suggests that maintaining a stable and healthy reservoir wetland area should be the focus of ecological reservoir management.

TI  - Assessing Boreal Peat Fire Severity and Vulnerability of Peatlands to Early Season Wildland Fire
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally peatlands store large amounts of carbon belowground with 80% distributed in boreal regions of the northern hemisphere. Climate warming and drying of the boreal region has been documented as affecting fire regimes, with increased fire frequency, severity and extent. While much research is dedicated to assessing changes in boreal uplands, few research efforts are focused on the vulnerability of boreal peatlands to wildfire. In this case study, an integration of field data collection, land cover mapping of peatland types and Landsat-based fire severity mapping was conducted for four early season (May to mid-June) wildfires where peatlands are abundant in northeastern Alberta Canada. The goal was to better understand if peatlands burn more or less preferentially than uplands in fires and how severely the organic soil layers (peat) of different peatland ecotypes burn. The focus was on early season wildfires because they dominated the research area in the decade of study. To do this, a novel Landsat-5 metric was developed to retrieve fire severity of the organic surface layer. Spatial comparisons and statistical analysis showed that proportionally bogs are more likely to burn in early season Alberta wildfires than other ecosystem types, even fire-prone upland conifer. Although for a small sample, we found that when fire weather conditions for the duff layers are severe, the fens of this study appear to become more susceptible to burning. In addition, overall bogs experienced greater severity of burn to the peat layers than fens. Due to the small sample size of peat loss from fire in uplands and limited geographic area of this case study, we were unable to assess if bogs are burning more severely than uplands. Further analysis and Landsat algorithm development for organic soil fire severity in peatlands and uplands are needed to more fully understand trends in belowground consumption for wildfires of all seasons and boreal ecotypes.

TI  - Salt marsh monitoring along the mid-Atlantic coast by Google Earth Engine enabled time series
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide a bulwark against sea-level rise (SLR), an interface between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, important nursery grounds for many species, a buffer against extreme storm impacts, and vast blue carbon repositories. However, salt marshes are at risk of loss from a variety of stressors such as SLR, nutrient enrichment, sediment deficits, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbances. Determining the dynamics of salt marsh change with remote sensing requires high temporal resolution due to the spectral variability caused by disturbance, tides, and seasonality. Time series analysis of salt marshes can broaden our understanding of these changing environments. This study analyzed aboveground green biomass (AGB) in seven mid-Atlantic Hydrological Unit Code 8 (HUC-8) watersheds. The study revealed that the Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed had the highest average loss and the largest net reduction in salt marsh AGB from 1999-2018. The study developed a method that used Google Earth Engine (GEE) enabled time series of the Landsat archive for regional analysis of salt marsh change and identified at-risk watersheds and salt marshes providing insight into the resilience and management of these ecosystems. The time series were filtered by cloud cover and the Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII). The combination of GEE enabled Landsat time series, and TMII filtering demonstrated a promising method for historic assessment and continued monitoring of salt marsh dynamics.

TI  - Consistency evaluation of landsat-7 and landsat-8 for improved monitoring of colored dissolved organic matter in complex water
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of Landsat satellites has been widely used to monitor water quality in coastal and inland complex water, but a solo Landsat satellite may not provide enough information because of its long revisit time (16-day) and frequent cloud cover, and hence sometimes it is necessary to fuse or combine the images from two or more satellites, for example, Landsat-7 and Landsat-8. However, the consistency of the two satellites has not been fully evaluated when they are used to estimate the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), an important water quality indicator. In this study, we used 210 Landsat-7 images and 185 neighboring Landsat-8 images from April 8, 2013 to December 26, 2018 in Sacramento River and Northern San Francisco Bay, USA, and extracted 225,265 paired samples to make the evaluation. A new Landsat-7 CDOM remote sensing model was established using these samples. The results show that the two satellites have good consistency for estimating low-level CDOM (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.05 m(-1), and MRE = 11.8%). This study shows that by combining Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 data, the available cloud-free observation frequency can be doubled compared with the frequency of using solo Landsat-8, and hence provide more detailed information for monitoring quality of complex water.

TI  - Field trials to detect drainage pipe networks using thermal and RGB data from unmanned aircraft
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of drainage pipe is documented as far back as 200 B. C. and continues to be used in poorly drained agricultural regions throughout the world. While good for crop production, the eco-hydrologic impacts of this modification have been shown to adversely affect natural drainage networks. Identifying the exact location of drainage pipe networks is essential to developing groundwater and surface water models. The geometry of drainage pipe networks installed decades ago has often been lost with time or was never well documented in the first place. Previous work has recognized that drainage pipes can be observed for certain soil types in visible spectrum (RGB) remote sensing data due to changes in soil albedo. In this work, small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) were used to collect high resolution RGB and thermal data to map subsurface drainage pipe. Within less than 96 h of a small (< 1.3 cm) rain event, a total of approximately 60 ha of sUAS thermal and RGB data were acquired at two different locations in the IML-CZO in Illinois. The thermal imagery showed limited evidence of thermal contrast related to the drainage pipe. If the data were acquired immediately after a rain event it is more likely a temperature contrast would have been detected due to lower soil moisture proximal to the drainage pipe network. The RGB data, however, elucidated the drainage pipe entirely at one site and elucidated traces of the drainage pipe at the other site. These results illustrate the importance of the timing of sUAS data collection with respect to the precipitation event. Ongoing related work focusing on laboratory and numerical experiments to better quantify feedbacks between albedo, soil moisture, and heat transfer will help predict the optimal timing of data collection for applications such as drainage pipe mapping.

TI  - Molecular Characteristics of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> Isolates From Outpatients in Sentinel Hospitals, Beijing, China, 2010-2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen associated with community-acquired and nosocomial infections. Since 2010, K. pneumoniae testing has been included into an existing diarrhea-syndrome surveillance system for estimating the prevalence of K. pneumoniae in diarrhea-syndrome patients, assessing antibiotic susceptibility, and investigating molecular characteristics of K. pneumoniae.Methods: Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were isolated from stool specimens from diarrhea-syndrome outpatients in Beijing, China. Isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, and phylogenetic relationships were explored though whole genome sequence analysis. Multi-locus sequence type (MLST) alleles were extracted from the whole genome sequence (WGS) data. A maximum likelihood tree was generated by MEGAX. Genomes were annotated by Prokka; core genes were produced by Roary; a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated using FastTree.Results: Forty-four K. pnuemoniae strains were isolated from 2010 to July 2019; of these 37 were K. pneumoniae and seven were K. variicola. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all 44 strains were sensitive to gentamicin, imipenem, amikacin, meropenem, kanamycin; 97.73% were sensitive to cefoxitin andlavo-ofloxacin; the highest antibiotic resistance rate was 79.55%, which was to ampicillin. We found three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains; we identified high-virulence ST types, including ST307 and ST65; and we found that ST23 has been the epidemic clone since 2010. MLST and core genome sequence analysis showed two distinct clusters of 44 K. pnuemoniae; 40 alleles were identified in core genome sequence analysis, while 36 alleles were identified in MLST typing.Conclusions: There is an urgent need for epidemiological and molecular studies to understand the dynamics of antibiotic resistance and virulence gene transmission to guide strategies for K. pneumoniae surveillance. WGS analysis provided high discrimination power and reliable and robust data useful for molecular epidemiology.

TI  - A new classification of satellite-derived liquid water cloud regimes at cloud scale
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are highly variable in time and space, affecting climate sensitivity and climate change. To study and distinguish the different influences of clouds on the climate system, it is useful to separate clouds into individual cloud regimes. In this work we present a new cloud classification for liquid water clouds at cloud scale defined using cloud parameters retrieved from combined satellite measurements from CloudSat and CALIPSO. The idea is that cloud heterogeneity is a measure that allows us to distinguish cumuliform and stratiform clouds, and cloud-base height is a measure to distinguish cloud altitude. The approach makes use of a newly developed cloud-base height retrieval. Using three cloud-base height intervals and two intervals of cloud-top variability as an inhomogeneity parameter provides six new liquid cloud classes. The results show a smooth transition between marine and continental clouds as well as between stratiform and cumuliform clouds in different latitudes at the high spatial resolution of about 20 km. Analysing the micro- and macrophysical cloud parameters from collocated combined MODIS, CloudSat and CALIPSO retrievals shows distinct characteristics for each cloud regime that are in agreement with expectation and literature. This demonstrates the usefulness of the classification.

TI  - Mapping Atlantic rainforest degradation and regeneration history with indicator species using convolutional network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is one of the global terrestrial hotspots of biodiversity. Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near Sao Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at similar to 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3% of the current region's natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, similar to 4757 ha) and that similar to 9% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated).

TI  - Oldest Immiscible Silica-rich Melt on the Moon Recorded in a ∼4.38 Ga Zircon
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal duration of lunar-evolved magmatism is still poorly constrained. In lunar meteorite Northwest Africa (NWA) 10049, a melt inclusion-bearing zircon fragment provides a new tool to understand the composition and age of the melts from which zircon directly crystallized. The studied zircon-hosted melt inclusions are silica rich and iron poor (e.g., similar to 80-90 wt% SiO2; <0.5 wt% FeO), compositionally similar with immiscible silica-rich melts found in Apollo rocks. Nano-SIMS U-Pb analyses of the zircon yielded a minimum crystallization age of 4,382 +/- 40 Ma, older than the ages for Apollo highly evolved alkali suite lithologies (similar to 3.8-4.33 Ga). Our study shows that the melt inclusion-bearing zircon in NWA 10049 is the oldest microscale evidence for documenting immiscible silica-rich melts in lunar samples, suggesting that lunar-evolved silica-rich melts were prevalent as early as similar to 4.38 Ga. This work implies that there would be a prolonged silicic magmatism occurred on the Moon.Plain Language Summary Lunar-evolved silica-rich melt is thought to be related to the formation of highly silicic lithologies (e.g., granitic lithologies). These rock types have been observed in Apollo returned samples as lithic clasts and also have been detected by remote-sensing data as silicic domes. The Apollo-evolved lithologies give a wide range of crystallization ages from similar to 3.8-4.33 Ga. However, there is still unclear about the temporal duration of lunar-evolved magmatism and volcanism. In lunar meteorite breccia NWA 10049, a melt inclusions-bearing zircon fragment provides a new tool to understand the composition and age of the melts from which zircon directly crystallized. The studied zircon-hosted melt inclusions are compositionally similar with immiscible silica-rich melts found in Apollo rocks. Nano-SIMS U-Pb analyses of the zircon yielded a minimum crystallization age of similar to 4.38 Ga. This age is older than the ages for Apollo-returned granites (up to 4.33 Ga) and ancient basaltic volcanism (i.e., up to similar to 4.37 Ga), making the studied zircon is the oldest microscale evidence for documenting lunar silicate liquid immiscibility.

TI  - An evaluation model for aboveground biomass based on hyperspectral data from field and TM8 in Khorchin grassland, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass is an important indicator for monitoring vegetation degradation and productivity. This study tests the applicability of Hyperspectral Remote-Sensing in situ measurements for high-precision estimation aboveground biomass (AGB) on regional scales of Khorchin grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. In order to improve prediction accuracy of AGB which is frequently used as an indicator of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), this paper combined ground measurement with remote sensing inversion to build the spectral model. The ground normalized difference vegetation index (SOC_NDVI) calculated from ground spectral of grassland vegetation which was measured by a portable visible/NIR hyperspectral spectrometer (SOC 710). Meanwhile, the remote normalized difference vegetation index (TM_NDVI) calculated from remote spectral of grassland vegetation which was measured by Thematic Mapper (TM) from Landsat 8 which launched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). According to regression analysis for the relationship between AGB and SOC_NDVI, SOC_NDVI and TM_NDVI, the evaluation model for aboveground biomass was developed (AGB = 12.523xe(3.370x(0.462xTM_ NDVI+0.413)), standard error = 24.74 g m(-2), R-2 = 0.636, p < 0.001). The model accuracy verification results show that the correlation between the measured value and the predicted value of biomass was better with low model standard error. The model could make up for the lack of timeliness and comprehensiveness of conventional ground biomass survey, and provide technical support for high-precision large-area productivity estimation and ecological degradation diagnosis of regional scale grassland.

TI  - Developing a Surgical Site Infection Surveillance System Based on Hospital Unstructured Clinical Notes and Text Mining
T2  - SURGICAL INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Electronic surveillance using clinical and administrative data from multiple sources has been reported as a tool for surveillance of surgical site infections (SSIs), but experiences are limited. In this study, we aimed to assess the accuracy of a text-searching algorithm to detect SSIs in children based on the application of regular expressions of unstructured clinical notes collected through different information systems.Methods: We developed an information system data warehouse that integrates data provided by electronic health and administrative records for patients who underwent surgical procedures in index weeks when active SSIs surveillances was conducted. To capture whether the patient developed an SSI, we developed a customized application to analyze clinical notes and code descriptions applying a pattern-matching algorithm based on regular expressions. We described the SSI cases detected by the active surveillance and the text-searching algorithm. To assess the accuracy in identifying the SSIs through the two methods, we adopted a reference standard that calculated the total number of SSIs as those detected by active surveillance plus those derived by the text-searching algorithm that was missed by active surveillance.Results: Compared with the total number of SSIs used as a reference standard, both methods had a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value >99.5%. Sensitivity was 70% for the text-mining algorithm and 60% for the active surveillance. Accuracy was >99% with both methods. The kappa value was 0.46.Conclusions: Compared with conventional surveillance of SSIs, a text-searching algorithm is a valid tool for case finding that has the potential to reduce drastically the workload of conventional surveillance, which involved direct contact with all families.

TI  - Characterization of groundwater potential zones using analytic hierarchy process and integrated geomatic techniques in Central Middle Atlas (Morocco)
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is an invaluable tool that has been applied by different specialists to upgrade their administration capacity. Managing groundwater resources particularly under arid land faces several limitations and problems such as the implications of various spatial factors, which lead managers to utilize multicriteria decision. In this research, a consistent approach was applied to identify groundwater potential (GWP) areas through the use of AHP, geographic information system (GIS), and (RS) techniques in the Central Middle Atlas, Morocco. First of all, the efficient groundwater potential thematic layers including lithology (Lt), karst (K), height above the nearest drainage (HAND) geomorphology, which is called HG, and lineament density (LD) were derived through spatial databases. Then, the weights assigned to the thematic layers on the basis of expert knowledge were standardized by the AHP's eigen vector technique. To calculate the groundwater potential index, the weighted linear combination (WLC) method was implemented in a GIS environment. The study found that only 3.88% of the study area had very good groundwater potential and 17.22% had a good potential, in addition to 20.20% with moderate potential, whereas in the most part of the region, 29.89% is within poor groundwater potential, and 18.60% are within very poor groundwater potential and 10.49% with non-potential. The very good GWP areas are located where the land cover majority is forests. The good, moderate, and poor GWP zones are located in areas where the land cover majority is shrublands. The poor and non-potential GWP zones are located in areas where the land cover majority is cropland.

TI  - Change Analysis of Spring Vegetation Green-Up Date in Qinba Mountains under the Support of Spatiotemporal Data Cube
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, global and local vegetation phenology has undergone significant changes due to the combination of climate change and human activities. Current researches have revealed the temporal and spatial distribution of vegetation phenology in large scale by using remote sensing data. However, researches on spatiotemporal differentiation of remote sensing phenology and its changes are limited which involves high-dimensional data processing and analysing. A new data model based on data cube technologies was proposed in the paper to efficiently organize remote sensing phenology and related reanalysis data in different scales. The multidimensional aggregation functions in the data cube promote the rapid discovery of the spatiotemporal differentiation of phenology. The exploratory analysis methods were extended to the data cube to mine the change characteristics of the long-term phenology and its influencing factors. Based on this method, the case study explored that the spring phenology of Qinba Mountains has a strong dependence on the topography, and the temperature plays a leading role in the vegetation green-up date distribution of the high-altitude areas while human activities dominate the low-altitude areas. The response of green-up trend slope seems to be the most sensitive at an altitude of about 2000 meters. This research provided a new approach for analysing phenology phenomena and its changes in Qinba Mountains that had the same reference value for other regional phenology studies.

TI  - Mapping and Understanding Patterns of Air Quality Using Satellite Data and Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of factors leading to harmfully high levels of particulate matter (PM) remains challenging. This study presents a novel approach using a statistical model that is trained to predict hourly concentrations of particles smaller than 10 mu m (PM10) by combining satellite-borne aerosol optical depth (AOD) with meteorological and land-use parameters. The model is shown to accurately predict PM10 (overall R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7.44 mu g/m(3)) for measurement sites in Germany. The capability of satellite observations to map and monitor surface air pollution is assessed by investigating the relationship between AOD and PM10 in the same modeling setup. Sensitivity analyses show that important drivers of modeled PM10 include multiday mean wind flow, boundary layer height (BLH), day of year (DOY), and temperature. Different mechanisms associated with elevated PM10 concentrations are identified in winter and summer. In winter, mean predictions of PM10 concentrations >35 mu g/m(3) occur when BLH is below similar to 500 m. Paired with multiday easterly wind flow, mean model predictions surpass 40 mu g/m(3) of PM10. In summer, PM10 concentrations seemingly are less driven by meteorology, but by emission or chemical particle formation processes, which are not included in the model. The relationship between AOD and predicted PM10 concentrations depends to a large extent on ambient meteorological conditions. Results suggest that AOD can be used to assess air quality at ground level in a machine learning approach linking it with meteorological conditions.

TI  - Coupled model constructed to simulate the landslide dam flood discharge: a case study of Baige landslide dam, Jinsha River
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide dam, always triggered by the strong earthquake and heavy rain, is a common natural disaster around the world. In this study, a coupled model was built by combining DB-IWHR model and the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the landslide dam flood discharge. We mapped the maximum Baige landslide dam flood inundated area based on Gaofen-1 imagery, and then simulated the process of Baige landslide dam flood discharge using this coupled model. It was proved that, with 80.05% F values, the coupled model was suitable to simulate the process of landslide dam flood discharge. Lastly, multiple scenarios were simulated respectively by setting varying width and depth of spillway. The results of scenarios 1-4 indicated that spillway width presented low sensibility to the peak flow in spillway and the time of its arrival, and similarly to the water depth at river cross-section and the inundated area. Water depth at river cross-section and the inundated area decreased as spillway width increased. Even if spillway width varied at 10 m interval, the average variation of water depth was less than 1.82 m and the variation of inundated area was less than 2.85%. However, the results of scenarios 5-8 indicated that spillway depth was sensitive to the peak flow in spillway and its arrival time, and also to water depth at river cross-section and the inundated area. Water depth at river cross-section and the inundated area increased first and then started to drop with spillway depth kept decreasing. When spillway depth varied at only 2 m interval, the average variation of water depth at river cross-section basically exceeded 2 m and the variation of inundated area was more than 2.85%.

TI  - Study on subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy: a bibliometric analysis <i>via</i> CiteSpace
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in pregnancy has drawn an increasing amount of attention over the past two decades. However, the definition of it, including its clinical diagnosis and treatment, is still being revised. An increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes have been shown in most but not all studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the origin, current trend and research hotspots on SCH in pregnancy. Methods: We obtained 630 records with 12,033 references, published between 1999 and 2018, from the online version of SCI-Expanded, Thomson Reuters Web of Science. The CiteSpace 5.3.R4 was used to perform the cooperation network analysis, key words co-occurrence and burst detection analysis, and reference cocitation analysis. Results: We identified that the number of publications on SCH in pregnancy was increasing over the past two decades. Teng WP and Shan ZY from the First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, were found to be the most productive researchers in this field. USA was the leading country for publications. Subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, dysfunction, disease, management, women, deficiency, association and hyperthyroidism were the top 10 high frequency keywords in all recruit documents. Follow up was the most strength burst key word in this field from 1999 through 2018, followed by maternal hypothyroxinemia, child, hypothyroidism complicating pregnancy, antithyroid antibody and fetal. Moreover, cocitation reference analysis revealed the top landmark articles and clusters in this field. Conclusion: This study provides the trends and frontiers in the field of SCH in pregnancy and valuable information for endocrine and/or obstetric researchers to identify new perspectives on potential collaborators and cooperative countries.

TI  - Estimation of cloud optical thickness, single scattering albedo and effective droplet radius using a shortwave radiative closure study in Payerne
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We have used a method based on ground-based solar radiation measurements and radiative transfer models (RTMs) in order to estimate the following cloud optical properties: cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud single scattering albedo (SSAc) and effective droplet radius (r(eff)). The method is based on the minimisation of the difference between modelled and measured downward shortwave radiation (DSR). The optical properties are estimated for more than 3000 stratus-altostratus (St-As) and 206 cirrus-cirrostratus (Ci-Cs) measurements during 2013-2017, at the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station in Payerne, Switzerland. The RTM libRadtran is used to simulate the total DSR as well as its direct and diffuse components. The model inputs of additional atmospheric parameters are either ground- or satellite-based measurements. The cloud cases are identified by the use of an all-sky cloud camera. For the low- to mid-level cloud class St-As, 95% of the estimated cloud optical thickness values using total DSR measurements in combination with a RTM, herein abbreviated as COTDSR, are between 12 and 92 with a geometric mean and standard deviation of 33.8 and 1.7, respectively. The comparison of these COTDSR values with COTBarnard values retrieved from an independent empirical equation results in a mean difference of - 1.2 +/- 2.7 and is thus within the method uncertainty. However, there is a larger mean difference of around 18 between COTDSR and COT values derived from MODIS level-2 (L2), Collection 6.1 (C6.1) data (COTMODIS). The estimated r(eff) (from liquid water path and COTDSR) for St-As are between 2 and 20 mu m. For the high-level cloud class Ci-Cs, COTDSR is derived considering the direct radiation, and 95% of the COTDSR values are between 0.32 and 1.40. For Ci-Cs, 95% of the SSAc values are estimated to be between 0.84 and 0.99 using the diffuse radiation. The COT for Ci-Cs is also estimated from data from precision filter radiometers (PFRs) at various wavelengths (COTPFR). The herein presented method could be applied and validated at other stations with direct and diffuse radiation measurements.

TI  - How emissions uncertainty influences the distribution and radiative impacts of smoke from fires in North America
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires and the aerosols that they emit impact air quality, health, and climate, but the abundance and properties of carbonaceous aerosol (both black carbon and organic carbon) from biomass burning (BB) remain uncertain and poorly constrained. We aim to explore the uncertainties associated with fire emissions and their air quality and radiative impacts from underlying dry matter consumed and emissions factors. To investigate this, we compare model simulations from a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, driven by a variety of fire emission inventories with surface and airborne observations of black carbon (BC) and organic aerosol (OA) concentrations and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). We focus on two fire-detection-based and/or burned-area-based (FD-BA) inventories using burned area and active fire counts, respectively, i.e., the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 (GFED4s) with small fires and the Fire INventory from NCAR version 1.5 (FINN1.5), and two fire radiative power (FRP)-based approaches, i.e., the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.4 (QFED2.4) and the Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFAS1.2). We show that, across the inventories, emissions of BB aerosol (BBA) differ by a factor of 4 to 7 over North America and that dry matter differences, not emissions factors, drive this spread. We find that simulations driven by QFED2.4 generally overestimate BC and, to a lesser extent, OA concentrations observations from two fire-influenced aircraft campaigns in North America (ARCTAS and DC3) and from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network, while simulations driven by FINN1.5 substantially underestimate concentrations. The GFED4s and GFAS1.2-driven simulations provide the best agreement with OA and BC mass concentrations at the surface (IMPROVE), BC observed aloft (DC3 and ARCTAS), and AOD observed by MODIS over North America. We also show that a sensitivity simulation including an enhanced source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from fires, based on the NOAA Fire Lab 2016 experiments, produces substantial additional OA; however, the spread in the primary emissions estimates implies that this magnitude of SOA can be neither confirmed nor ruled out when comparing the simulations against the observations explored here. Given the substantial uncertainty in fire emissions, as represented by these four emission inventories, we find a sizeable range in 2012 annual BBA PM2.5 population-weighted exposure over Canada and the contiguous US (0.5 to 1.6 mu g m(-3)). We also show that the range in the estimated global direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosol from fires (-0.11 to -0.048 W m(-2)) is large and comparable to the direct radiative forcing of OA (-0.09 W m(-2)) estimated in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our analysis suggests that fire emissions uncertainty challenges our ability to accurately characterize the impact of smoke on air quality and climate.

TI  - The Empire Strikes Back: Propagating AKP's Ottoman Empire Narrative on Turkish Television
T2  - MIDDLE EAST CRITIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Turkish drama series aired on state network TRT (Turkish Radio and Television) connect Ottoman history with contemporary events in Turkey and have been instrumental agents in the government's attempts to shape the political reality in accordance with its political agenda. This article examines the narrative cultivated by the popular historical drama Payitaht: Abdulhamid (2017) by using the dramatistic process framework. In doing so, it analyzes the overlapping narrative of historical and contemporary in-groups and out-groups. Payitaht: Abdulhamid recreates the current political divides on screen in Turkey by assigning guilt and redeemer statuses to certain characters in the drama series and by providing a longitudinal perspective of Turkish history. Payitaht: Abdulhamid is, therefore, a political tool used by the ruling AKP (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi [Justice and Development Party]) government to cultivate and propagate a worldview that connects the Ottoman past to contemporary politics. Furthermore, Payitaht: Abdulhamid feeds the existent divisions within Turkey by reinforcing the AKP's political discourse on key domestic and foreign policy issues and helps to push its agenda to the fore.

TI  - The power to structure: exploring social worlds of privacy, technology and power in the Tor Project
T2  - INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - As Internet freedom movements build infrastructures to promote online privacy, they enrol a wide range of different kinds of of technological work [Coleman, E. G., & Golub, A. (2008). Hacker practice: Moral genres and the cultural articulation of liberalism. Anthropological Theory, 8(3), 255-277]. I explore the cultures of the wider forms of technical work involved in these struggles through a sociological study of the Tor Project, involving twenty-six qualitative interviews with people in the Tor community and extensive archival research in Tor's mailing lists and design documents. Tor is an online privacy infrastructure whose practice of radical transparency makes it uniquely accessible, and it constitutes an example of a successful, widely used infrastructure which directly undermines the centralisation of governmental power online. Tor is not united around a single worldview, instead exhibiting three distinct framings of its work. Using Susan Leigh Star's social worlds framework, I characterise these three 'social worlds' of Tor. I argue that Tor has in the past accommodated its internal clashing perspectives through an ambiguity around politics and a shared construction of the users of Tor, which allow individuals to bridge and translate between these worlds. In recent years, this political ambiguity has become unsustainable. As Internet platforms and infrastructures extend further into social life around the world, so too are they being forced to come to terms with the shaping forces they exert on society and the values they represent. Tor is not exempt from this, and as it navigates these issues it is becoming increasingly mindful of its own relationships to power, values and politics.

TI  - Bee communities and pollination services in adjacent crop fields following flower removal in an invasive forest shrub
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The habitat boundaries between crops and seminatural areas influence bee movements and pollination services to crops. Edges also provide favorable conditions for invasive plants, which may usurp pollinators and reduce visitation to native or crop plants. Alternatively, floral displays of alien plants may facilitate, or increase, the pollination success of adjacent plants by attracting more pollinators to the area. Therefore, pollination services of bees from seminatural habitats to crop areas should vary with the presence of invasive floral resources and distance from habitat edges. To test the hypothesis that floral resources of invasive forest shrubs affect the bee community and pollination services in adjacent crop fields, we conducted a 2-yr field experiment along forest-crop edges at five isolated forest remnants. We removed flower buds from a dominant invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle), along forest-crop edges and paired removals with controls of intact flowers. The bee community, their pollination services, and flower visitation rates were quantified along a 200-m gradient into an adjacent crop field using pan traps and sentinel cucumber plants. Impacts to the bee community were dependent of bee functional traits. Larger bees visited fewer sentinel cucumber flowers in flower removal plots, which corresponded with decreased cucumber pollination compared to plots with honeysuckle flowers at distances >100 m from forest edges. Small-bodied and weaker flying bees visited sentinel plants more frequently closer to the forest edge and increased pollination services to cucumber at distances L. maackii shrubs in flower removal plots. After 2 yr, bee abundance and species richness increased within flower removal plots across all distances. High functional diversity of the bee community increased pollination services to sentinel plants and increased cucumber production within 200 m from forest remnants. Our findings suggest that dense floral resources of invasive shrubs suppressed forest-edge bee communities and their pollination services, but also attracted large-bodied generalist bees, which were effective pollinators. This study helps explain how life histories and functional attributes of bees can predict either facilitation or suppression of pollination services to crop or native plants in response to invasive floral resources.

TI  - Wavelet Thresholding-Based Despeckling of COSMO-SkyMed SAR Image
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection of an efficient speckle filter for SAR imagery primarily depends upon a specific application of interest and statistical characteristics of the noise present in SAR datasets. The main goal of this study is to assess the performance of the two wavelet shrinkage-based filtering techniques (VISU shrink and SURE shrink) against two spatial adaptive filters (Enhanced Lee and Gamma MAP) and one non-local filter (NL-SAR) for the removal of speckle noise from high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR datasets. Before applying these filters to real CSK datasets, they are tested on synthetically generated speckled test datasets and benchmark simulated SAR datasets. Experimental analysis has been conducted on synthetically generated speckled datasets based on varying level of speckle noise introduced on test images. In case of benchmark datasets, numerous qualitative and quantitative measures are observed and evaluated. To find the best filter for real CSK data, a Pareto optimality concept has been used where the coefficient of variation is the parameter considered. From the findings, it is evident that VISU shrink-generated speckle filtering solution is non-dominated by all the other filtering solutions except NL-SAR-based speckle suppression in smooth areas. Considering the various user-defined situations of homogeneity and heterogeneity in the SAR scene, an overall performance index is formulated and VISU shrink performs the best in all user-defined conditions.

TI  - Climate Change May Increase the Drought Stress of Mesophytic Trees Downslope With Ongoing Forest Mesophication Under a History of Fire Suppression
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous headwater catchments, downslope flow of subsurface water could buffer downslope forest communities from soil moisture stress during drought. Here we investigated changes in landscape-scale vegetation patterns at five forested headwater catchments in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachians. We used a ca. 30-year Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image record of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), spanning a period of recorded warming since the mid-1970. We then, related spatial and temporal canopy patterns to seasonal water balance, streamflow recession behavior, and low flow dynamics from the long-term hydrologic records. All hydrologic metrics indicated increasing evapotranspiration, decreasing streamflow given precipitation, and potentially decreasing downslope subsidy at the watershed scale over time, especially during low-flow periods. Contrary to expectations, leaf area index (LAI) and basal area increased more upslope compared to downslope over time, coincident with warming. Trends in the ratio of NDVI in upslope and downslope topographic positions were also supported by long-term tree basal area increment, litterfall, and sap flux data in one of the reference watersheds. Mesophytic trees downslope appeared to respond more to frequent droughts and experience lower growth than xerophytic trees upslope, closely mediated by the isohydric/anisohydric continuum along hydrologic flow paths. Considering ongoing forest "mesophication" under a history of fire suppression across the eastern United States deciduous forests, this study suggests that mesophytic trees downslope may be more vulnerable than xerophytic trees upslope under ongoing climate change due to an apparent dependence on upslope water subsidy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has recently been introduced to the sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping because of the benefits of the SLN biopsy, such as providing real-time and high-resolution optical guidance. Methylene blue is available and less expensive as an SLN mapping tracer. Our study aims to identify SLN through the NIR fluorescence imaging system mediated by blue dye.Methods Early-stage breast cancer patients were prospectively enrolled. All participants received a subareolar or peritumoral injection of 1 mL methylene blue (MB) before surgery. The MB fluorescence system was set immediately after injection. SLNs were searched and removed under the guidance of fluorescence and blue dye.Results We identified SLN adequately with the help of real-time lymphography and blue dye. Symbolic lymphatic drainage patterns were also observed.Conclusion NIR fluorescence imaging mediated by blue dye has benefits on the identification of lymph vessels, the location of SLN, and the patterns of breast lymphatic flow.

TI  - The Interaction of Policy Narratives, Moral Politics, and Criminal Justice Policy Beliefs
T2  - POLITICS & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Criminal justice reform is one of the many contentious issues we face in an increasingly polarized political climate. Differing perceptions of issues like these may be explained by underlying belief systems and expressed through narratives. This study employs the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) by Moral Politics Theory as the theoretical underpinning for policy narratives. Moral Politics Theory states that policy beliefs are shaped by either a Strict Father (individual responsibility) or Nurturant Parent (societal responsibility) worldview. Visitors to Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site read one criminal justice narrative from each worldview and selected which was more persuasive. Worldview and policy beliefs predicted which narrative was found persuasive; however, the analysis revealed there may be bilateral support for a combination of individual and societal responsibilities. Finally, this study supports and expands the NPF to a new context and population.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of land cover classification in cloud persistent areas using optical and radar satellite image time series
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The recent availability of high spatial and temporal resolution optical and radar satellite imagery has dramatically increased opportunities for mapping land cover at fine scales. Fusion of optical and radar images has been found useful in tropical areas affected by cloud cover because of their complementarity. However, the multitemporal dimension these data now offer is often neglected because these areas are primarily characterized by relatively low levels of seasonality and because the consideration of multitemporal data requires more processing time. Hence, land cover mapping in these regions is often based on imagery acquired for a single date or on an average of multiple dates.The aim of this work is to assess the added value brought by the temporal dimension of optical and radar time series when mapping land cover in tropical environments. Specifically, we compared the accuracies of classifications based on (a) optical time series, (b) their temporal average, (c) radar time series, (d) their temporal average, (e) a combination of optical and radar time series and (f) a combination of their temporal averages for mapping land cover in Jambi province, Indonesia, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery.Using the full information contained in the time series resulted in significantly higher classification accuracies than using temporal averages (+14.7% for Sentinel-1, +2.5% for Sentinel-2 and +2% combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2). Overall, combining Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series provided the highest accuracies (Kappa = 88.5%).Our study demonstrates that preserving the temporal information provided by satellite image time series can significantly improve land cover classifications in tropical biodiversity hotspots, improving our capacity to monitor ecosystems of high conservation relevance such as peatlands. The proposed method is reproducible, automated and based on open-source tools satellite imagery.

TI  - Simulating spatial-temporal urban growth of a Moroccan metropolitan using CA-Markov model
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous urban expansion is one of the most important problems in urban development due to its negative societal and environmental impacts. This study encompasses the spatial-temporal of land use/cover change (LUCC) monitoring (1999-2018) and urban growth modelling (2010-2040) of El Jadida city, Morocco. For this purpose, Landsat-7 ETM and Landsat-8 OLI images combined with a Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model were used to simulate and forecast LUCC. The characteristics of LUCC were discussed based on the land cover maps along with urban gradient analysis. After understanding the spatial-temporal patterns of LUCC, the CA-Markov and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model were employed using the historical land cover maps and other auxiliary data to simulate and forecast LUCC. The results showed that the urban area (built-up) increased with 19.8 km(2). The rapid urbanization has replaced and transform bare soil (net loss 12.7 km(2)) followed by vegetation cover (net loss 7.1 km(2)) during 1999-2018. The result exhibited that the predominant built-up development was observed in south-west followed by south-east direction majorly within the municipal limits. The projected LULC exhibit that the built-up area will increase from 29.9 to 43.8 km(2) with an average annual growth rate of 0.63, primarily in western and eastern parts during 2018-2040. The result for year 2040 with reasonably good accuracy will be useful to the planners, policy and decision makers. Therefore, the protection measures for environment should be set in advance according to the forecasting results of this study.

TI  - Ammonia measurements from space with the Cross-track Infrared Sounder: characteristics and applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its clear importance, the monitoring of atmospheric ammonia, including its sources, sinks, and links to the greater nitrogen cycle, remains limited. Satellite data are helping to fill the gap in monitoring from sporadic conventional ground- and aircraft-based observations to better inform policymakers and assess the impact of any ammonia-related policies. Presented is a description and survey that demonstrate the capabilities of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) ammonia product for monitoring, air quality forecast model evaluation, dry deposition estimates, and emission estimates from an agricultural hotspot. For model evaluation, while there is a general agreement in the spatial allocation of known major agricultural ammonia hotspots across North America, the satellite observations show some high-latitude regions during peak forest fire activity often have ammonia concentrations approaching those in agricultural hotspots. The CrIS annual ammonia dry depositions in Canada (excluding the territories) and the US have average and annual variability values of similar to 0.8 +/- 0.08 and similar to 1.23 +/- 0.09 Tg N yr(-1), respectively. These satellite-derived dry depositions of reactive nitrogen from NH3 with NO2 show an annual ratio of NH3 compared to their sum (NH3 + NO2) of similar to 82 % and similar to 55 % in Canada and the US, respectively. Furthermore, we show the use of CrIS satellite observations to estimate annual and seasonal emissions near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, a region dominated by high- emission concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs); the satellite annual emission estimate of 37.1 +/- 6.3 kt yr(-1) is at least double the value reported in current bottom-up emission inventories for this region.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing land use/cover (LULC) change in coastal lakes is an essential process for sustainable development. Edku Lake is one of the most important lakes in the northern part of Nile Delta in Egypt. It is directly subject to severe anthropogenic activities. The main objectives of this work were to predict LULC changes within Edku Lake area and to develop a pollution sensitivity model using remote sensing data and modern geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Three Landsat images were acquired in 2000, 2011 and 2018. These images were preprocessed, geo-referenced and prepared for further supervised classification using the maximum likelihood classifier. Five LULC classes were found in the area (water, vegetation, urban, bare and fish farm). CA-Markov model was applied to predict LULC changes using IDRISI software between each two consequent years. A predicted LULC map was obtained for 2025. This map can provide suggestions for future urban and vegetative planning in the studied area. This area was subject to severe changes from 2000 to 2018. Fish farms were significantly increased during this period. The predicted LULC map for 2025 indicates that large vegetative areas will be converted into urban and fish farms. The pollution sensitivity model showed that the eastern parts of the lake are more sensitive to pollution compared with the rest of the lake. Accordingly, protection of biodiversity in Edku Lake can be achieved based on future scenarios and measuring sensitivity of environmental factors and surrounding activities.

TI  - Unexpected long-range transport of glyoxal and formaldehyde observed from the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite during the 2018 Canadian wildfires
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glyoxal (CHOCHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are intermediate products in the tropospheric oxidation of the majority of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). CHOHO is also a precursor of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere. CHOCHO and HCHO are released from biogenic, anthropogenic, and pyrogenic sources. CHOCHO and HCHO tropospheric lifetimes are typically considered to be short during the daytime at mid-latitudes (e.g. several hours), as they are rapidly removed from the atmosphere by their photolysis, oxidation by OH, and uptake on particles or deposition. At night and at high latitudes, tropospheric lifetimes increase to many hours or even days. Previous studies demonstrated that CHOCHO and HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) are well retrieved from space-borne observations using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS). In this study, we present CHOCHO and HCHO VCDs retrieved from measurements by TROPOMI (TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument), launched on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) platform in October 2017. We observe strongly elevated amounts of CHOCHO and HCHO during the 2018 fire season in British Columbia, Canada, where a large number of fires occurred in August. CHOCHO and HCHO plumes from individual fire hot spots are observed in air masses travelling over distances of up to 1500 km, i.e. much longer than expected for the relatively short tropospheric lifetime expected for CHOCHO and HCHO. Comparison with simulations by the particle dispersion model FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) indicates that effective lifetimes of 20 h and more are needed to explain the observations of CHOCHO and HCHO if they decay in an effective first-order process. FLEXPART used in the study calculates accurately the transport. In addition an exponential decay, in our case assumed to be photochemical, of a species along the trajectory is added. We have used this simple approach to test our assumption that CHOCHO and HCHO are created in the fires and then decay at a constant rate in the plume as it is transported. This is clearly not the case and we infer that CHOCHO and HCHO are either efficiently recycled during transport or continuously formed from the oxidation of longer-lived precursors present in the plume, or possibly a mixture of both. We consider the best explanation of the observed CHOCHO and HCHO VCD in the plumes of the fire is that they are produced by oxidation of longer-lived precursors, which were also released by the fire and present in the plume.

AB  - Sustainable development aims for a viable interaction between human and physical nature. However, how do we perceive the social and natural world, rationalize our behavior, and modify our ways of life? Here, we apply the idea of worldviews to cognition and rationality in transport since a transition to sustainable mobility is crucial in dealing with global climate change. We utilize Cultural Theory and the British Social Attitudes survey (N = 1,120) to study how three worldviews-egalitarianism, hierarchy, and individualism-relate to people's attitudes to sustainable mobility. First, we use factor analysis to extract the three worldviews or ways of life in Great Britain. Second, we construct hypotheses concerning the correlations between the worldviews and social attitudes to sustainable mobility. Our statistical analysis of 11 mobility issues in the survey confirms our hypotheses, elucidating the cultural cognition or rationality that underlies people's transport decision-making. Egalitarianism favors demand control, environmental friendliness, and action driven by inner conviction; hierarchy privileges conformity, order, and security; and individualism embraces freedom, speed, and external incentives. The findings show that the worldviews have a systematic and comprehensive impact on how people assess sustainable mobility debates. Moreover, we perform regression analysis to investigate how these cultural styles are associated with British people's sociodemographics and political party identification, which can help identify the characteristics of stakeholders in sustainability planning and engagement. We conclude that the worldviews form the bedrock of individual decisions on sustainable mobility and have a wider significance for holistic sustainability governance.

TI  - Milling force and surface morphology of 45 steel under different Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanofluid concentrations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanofluid minimum quantity lubrication (NMQL) is a resource-saving, environment-friendly, and efficient green processing technology. Cottonseed oil can form a strong lubricating film owing to its abundant saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, which have excellent lubricating properties. The physical and chemical properties of nanofluids change when Al2O3 nanoparticles are added. However, the effects of cottonseed oil-based Al2O3 nanofluid concentrations on the milling force and workpiece surface quality remain unclear. To address this limitation, 45 steel was used to conduct NMQL milling experiments of cottonseed oil-based Al2O3 nanofluids with different mass fractions. Results showed that the minimum milling force was obtained at a concentration of 0.2 wt% (F-x = 58 N, F-y = 12 N). The minimum surface roughness value (R-a = 1.009 mu m, RSm = 0.136 mm) was obtained at a mass concentration of 0.5 wt%, and the micromorphology of the workpiece/chip was optimal.

TI  - Change of Pathological Type to Metaplastic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Breast During Disease Recurrence: Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a rare and heterogeneous group of primary breast malignancies. The etiology, pathogenesis, and proper treatment for this kind rare breast cancer are still unclear.Case presentation: We reported a case of a 55-year-old woman with a palpable lump in the inner quadrant of the right breast. She underwent a right breast mass resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which revealed that the tumor was an invasive ductal carcinoma, followed by four cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and four cycles of docetaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy, and then simultaneous integrated boost intensity modulated radiotherapy to the whole right breast. After 2 years' follow-up, she had biopsy-proven disease recurrence in the right breast, which revealed SCC, and a mammogram showed abnormalities in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast and left axillary lymph nodes. Then we performed bilateral breast modified radical mastectomy, which confirmed that the recurrent tumors were metaplastic SCC, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy of the left supraclavicular and apical axillary regions. There has been no recurrent or metastatic evidence in the 16 months' follow-up since the second surgery.Conclusion: This case report shows that evolution of pathology type in recurrent breast cancer after initial treatment is possible. Detailed pathologic and immunohistochemical analyses are needed for identification of this change. Surgery and adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy are appropriate treatments for recurrent primary SCC of the breast.

TI  - [Surgical selection and metastatic warning of splenic lymph node dissection in advanced gastric cancer radical surgery: a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial].
T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Objective: To investigate the surgical options for splenic lymph node dissection in patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing radical total gastrectomy, and to evaluate the sentinel effect of No. 4s lymph node on splenic lymph node metastasis. Methods: A prospective, single-center, randomized and controlled study was carried out (Trial registration, No.NCT02980861). Enrollment criteria: (1) >18 years old and <65 years old; (2) gastric adenocarcinoma locating in the proximal or corpus; (3) preoperative clinical staging as cT2-4aN0-3M0; (4) D2 radical total gastrectomy feasible judged before operation; (5) physical ability score 0 to 1; (6) I to III of ASA classification. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with severe mental illness or previous history of upper abdominal surgery, those suffered from other malignant tumors in the past 5 years, or heart and lung system diseases judged to affect surgery before operation, those receiving preoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or targeted therapies, and distant metastases being found during surgery were excluded. According to above criteria, 222 patients at The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital from December 2016 to December 2017 were enrolled prospectively and were randomly divided into the laparoscopic splenic hilar lymph node dissection group (laparoscopic group, n=114) and the open splenic hilar lymph node dissection group (open group, n=108). The result of rapid frozen immunohistochemistry of harvested No.4s lymph nodes was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of sentinel effect on splenic hilar lymph node metastasis. The surgical parameters, postoperative recovery parameters, and complication rates were compared between the two groups. Results: There were 80 males and 34 females in the lapascopic group with a mean age of (56.1±10.2) years, and 69 males and 39 females in the open group with a mean age of (58.4±10.9) years. There were no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups (all P>0.05). Total blood loss was less in the laparoscopic group [(96.3±82.4) ml vs. (116.6±101.9) ml, t=1.124, P<0.001], and the amount of bleeding from the splenic hilar lymph nodes dissected was also less than that in the open group [(25.3±17.8) ml vs. (59.5±36.4) ml, t=1.172, P<0.001]. However, the operation time, the time of splenic hilar lymph node, the number of lymph node dissected and number of splenic hilar lymph node dissected were not significantly different between the two groups (all P>0.05). As compared to the open group, the laparoscopic group had shorter time to the first flatus [(1.3±1.2) days vs. (1.6±1.5) days, t=1.665, P=0.021], shorter time to fluid diet [(4.6±1.4) days vs. (4.9 ± 1.6) days, t=1.436, P=0.007], shorter time to remove nasogastric tube [(3.9±2.6) days vs. (4.3±2.4) days, t=0.687, P<0.001] and shorter hospital stay [(10.3±6.6) days vs. (12.1±7.2) days, t=0.697, P<0.001]. Complication rate was 14.0% (16/114) and (12.0%) ((1)3/108) in the laparoscopic group and the open group, respectively, without significant difference (chi(2)=6.723, P=0.331). The sensitivity of the No. 4s lymph node for the prediction of splenic hilar lymph node metastasis reached 89.5%, and the specificity reached 99.6%. Conclusions: Laparoscopic technique is safe and feasible in the treatment of splenic hilar lymph node dissection in advanced gastric cancer. The No.4s lymph node examination has good sentinel effect on predicting the metastasis of splenic hilar lymph nodes.

TI  - Unbalanced forest displacement across the coastal urban groups of eastern China in recent decades
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The jing-Jin-ji urban group (JJJug), the Yangtze River Delta urban group (YRDug) and the Pearl River Delta urban group (PRDug) are major urban groups of eastern China that play crucial roles in the economy and ecology. With rapid urbanization, demand for land for urban construction has significantly increased, causing direct and indirect losses of forests. At the same time, forest protection and restoration are being promoted in the construction of forested urban groups in response to the 13th Five-Year Plan for forestry development of China in the above-mentioned regions. These inevitable contradictory demands for land may inhibit regional sustainable development. However, how forest coverage changed and its ecological impacts in recent decades have rarely been systematically evaluated. To address this issue, this paper quantitatively investigated the spatial and temporal variations in forest coverage and the evolution of landscape patterns using remote sensing data across the Mug, the YRDug and the PRDug from 1992 to 2015. The results show that forest coverage in the Bug first increased and then decreased, while that in the YRDug and the PRDug showed a sustained decline during the study period. In the case of land displacement, on the one hand, the three urban groups exhibited a transition from forest to farmland in the forest-farm ecotone at medium and high altitudes. On the other hand, grassland and shrubland were changed into forest mainly in the outer suburbs. Furthermore, in general, the landscape fragmentation in the urban groups significantly increased because of urban expansion. Besides, that of the Mug exhibited an obvious spatial heterogeneity with a decline in the north while an increase in the south. Overall, unbalanced forest displacement, which could lead to a negative effect on both forest-coverage quantity and landscape quality, should be given more attention in the future development of forested urban groups.

TI  - LEO-BDS-GPS integrated precise orbit modeling using FengYun-3D, FengYun-3C onboard and ground observations
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The new FengYun-3 (FY-3) meteorological satellite, FengYun-3D (FY-3D), carries an enhanced version of the GNSS Occultation Sounder (GNOS) instrument with increased BDS and GPS tracking channels. These high-quality onboard BDS observations together with FengYun-3C (FY-3C) data can serve as an effective supplement to overcome the weakness in BDS tracking geometry. To assess the scope of the low earth orbit (LEO)-induced improvements on the BDS satellite orbits, we processed the ground network and two FY-3 satellites (FY-3C and FY-3D) in a common least-squares adjustment. Three integrated precise orbit determination (POD) schemes with the individual LEO and a combination of two LEOs are designed to investigate the contribution of the new FY-3D satellite. The performance of FY-3D POD is discussed first. Due to the increase in observation redundancy, the FY-3D orbit presents smaller overlap differences than FY-3C. The corresponding precision improvement can reach 72% for the BDS-only POD, 13% for the GPS-only POD and 25% for the GPS and BDS POD. The overlap result of integrated POD indicates that FY-3D contributes a stronger enhancement to GPS and BDS orbits than FY-3C because of its noticeable increase in onboard observations. The most pronounced benefit can be observed in BDS GEO orbits, which is improved by 44% for the regional solution and 41% for the global solution compared to the FY-3C solution. As expected, a further reduction in the overlap differences can be noted when adding FY-3C to the FY-3D global solution. Compared with the FY-3D solution, the orbit precision of BDS GEO, IGSO and MEO for the 2-LEO solution is slightly improved by 3%, 3%, and 1%, respectively, which is mainly limited by the few observations contributed by FY-3C.

TI  - Assessment of Ecological Environment Status in the Longxi-Hongkou National Nature Reserve Based on Remote Sensing Ecological Index
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The giant panda nature reserve play a momentous role in maintaining the biodiversity of its surrounding areas. A catastrophic earthquake happened in Wenchuan in the year of 2008 caused a severe ecological degradation in many panda's habitats nearby. Based on four phases of the Landsat images from 1998 to 2017 in Longxi-Hongkou National Nature Reserve, the study integrated principal component analysis method and four indicators including normalized vegetation index (NDVI) , normalized difference built-up and soil index (NDSI) , and land surface temperature ( LST) to build a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and form a comprehensive evaluation model to synthetically assess the ecological environment status in the study area. The results show that the RSEI values of Longxi-Hongkou National Nature Reserve in 1998, 2007, 2008 and 2017 were 0. 748 1, 0. 752 1, 0. 411 0 and 0. 599 1, respectively. It indicates that the ecological environment in the study area got better first then deteriorated and improved at last during the period of 20 years, but the overall trend was in a degraded state. It is noteworthy that the ecological environment changed significantly before and after the earthquake, especially the ecological environment in the hilly and subalpine areas with an elevation of 1 400-2 600 m showed an obvious deterioration trend, mainly because the vegetation distruction caused by the earthquake, which has resulted in the reduction of water area and the formation of bare land. Green degree and wetness have positive effects on the key factors affecting the ecological environment, while dryness and heat have negative effects on the ecological environment.

TI  - Urban warming advances spring phenology but reduces the response of phenology to temperature in the conterminous United States
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has caused environmental changes, such as urban heat islands (UHIs), that affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, how and to what extent urbanization affects plant phenology remains relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated the changes in the satellite-derived start of season (SOS) and the covariation between SOS and temperature (R-T) in 85 large cities across the conterminous United States for the period 2001-2014. We found that 1) the SOS came significantly earlier (6.1 +/- 6.3 d) in 74 cities and R-T was significantly weaker (0.03 +/- 0.07) in 43 cities when compared with their surrounding rural areas (P < 0.05); 2) the decreased magnitude in R-T mainly occurred in cities in relatively cold regions with an annual mean temperature <17.3 degrees C (e.g., Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania); and 3) the magnitude of urban-rural difference in both SOS and R-T was primarily correlated with the intensity of UHI. Simulations of two phenology models further suggested that more and faster heat accumulation contributed to the earlier SOS, while a decrease in required chilling led to a decline in R-T magnitude in urban areas. These findings provide observational evidence of a reduced covariation between temperature and SOS in major US cities, implying the response of spring phenology to warming conditions in nonurban environments may decline in the warming future.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Assi river in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, is now a small, local, ephemeral floodplain tributary of River Ganga, with a length of about 8 km and catchment area of about 22 km(2). It has also turned into a filthy drain. There are evidences in the form of palaeochannels, through patterns of water bodies and settlements along them, to suggest the origin of Assi river near Allahabad flowing through a distance of about 120 km up to Varanasi to meet the Ganga. There is also the possibility that Assi started as a takeoff from River Ganga and flowed as a Yazoo stream. Through on-screen digitization from high and medium-resolution remote sensing data - BHUVAN and Google Earth, CORONA aerial photographs, IRS P6 LISS-IV, Landsat 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 - and a number of cross profiles from SRTM 30 m digital elevation model (DEM), palaeochannel of Assi has been delineated. Also, a 1 m DEM was generated for the present Assi catchment area from about 5000 DGPS points to present proof that the present Assi is a misfit in once a wider valley shaped by heavy discharge coming from a greater length of channel and a larger catchment area.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuation in three mode of greenhouse gases emission in relation to soil labile carbon pools in degraded mangrove, Sundarban, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical mangrove represents one of the most threatened ecosystems despite their huge contribution to ecosystem services, carbon (C) sequestration and climate change mitigation. Understanding the system in light of seasonal fluctuations on greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions due to human interferences and the tidal effect is important for devising site-specific real-time climate change mitigation strategies. In order to capture the seasonal variations, the three modes of transport of GHGs through pneumatophore, ebullition as bubbles and water-soluble diffusion was quantified. The three unique techniques for the gas collection were used to estimate the GHGs [methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)] emission, at three degraded-mangrove sites in Sundarban, India. We identified three degraded mangrove ecologies based on the remote sensing data of 1930 and 2013 (mangrove-covered area in Sundarban; 2387, 2136 km(2), respectively). Samples were collected and analyzed for four seasons [winter (November-January), summer (February-April), pre-monsoon (MayJune) and monsoon (July-October)], at three representative sites (Sadhupur, Dayapur, and Pakhiralaya). Monsoonal CH4 and CO2 fluxes (0353 +/- 0.026 and 64.5 +/- 6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively) were higher than winter and summer. However, the soil labile C pools showed the opposite trend i.e. more in summer followed by winter and monsoon. In contrast, the N2O fluxes were more during summer (542 +/- 3.2 mu mol m(-2)d(-1)). The stagnant water had higher dissolved GHGs concentration compared to tidewater due to less salinity and a long time of stagnation. The mode of transport of GHGs through pneumatophore, ebullition, and water-soluble diffusion was also significantly varied with seasons, soil-carbon status and tidewater intrusion. Therefore, seasonal fluctuations of GHGs emission and tidal effect must be considered along with soil labile C pools for GHG-C budgeting and climate change mitigation in the mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Deep learning for coastal resource conservation: automating detection of shellfish reefs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is increasingly important to understand the extent and health of coastal natural resources in the face of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes. Coastal ecosystems are difficult to efficiently monitor due to the inability of existing remotely sensed data to capture complex spatial habitat patterns. To help managers and researchers avoid inefficient traditional mapping efforts, we developed a deep learning tool (OysterNet) that uses unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) imagery to automatically detect and delineate oyster reefs, an ecosystem that has proven problematic to monitor remotely. OysterNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that assesses intertidal oyster reef extent, yielding a difference in total area between manual and automated delineations of just 8%, attributable in part to OysterNet's ability to detect oysters overlooked during manual demarcation. Further training of OysterNet could enable assessments of oyster reef heights and densities, and incorporation of more coastal habitat types. Future iterations will be applied to high-resolution satellite data for effective management at larger scales.

TI  - Land Type Information Extraction and Landscape Pattern Dynamic Analysis of Laoshan Scenic Area
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The Laoshan scenic area is an ecological barrier and biodiversity conservation area in Nanjing City. The dominant ecosystem in Laoshan is forest, its ecological position is extremely important. This study aims to analyze the dynamic changes of the landscape pattern in the scenic area for the past 17 years. Local land use information based on Landsat images from 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2017 was extracted, using the technical method of object-oriented fuzzy classification, C5. 0 decision tree classification, pixel-based maximum likelihood, artificial neural network and support vector machine. In addition, Fragstats 4. 2 software was used to extract multiple landscape pattern indexes, for the comparison of dynamic landscape pattern from 2001 to 2017. Results show that the object-oriented fuzzy classification method had the highest overall accuracy ( 91. 79% ) and Kappa coefficient was 0. 83. With the continuous construction and reform, the degree of landscape fragmentation in Laoshan scenic area has deepened. From 2001 to 2017, the number of patches ( NP ) showed an increasing trend, and reached 653 in 2017, with the patch density of 5. 928 1 blocks . km(-2). In 2017, contagion index ( CONTAG ) increased compared with that of 2001, reaching 59. 41%, and the connectivity of dominant patch types has improved. The Shannon's diversity index ( SHDI ) value fluctuated in a narrow range, reaching a maximum of 0. 725 5 in 2009. With the development of construction to a mature state, the overall development process slowly enters into an orderly state, and scenic area in Laoshan has gradually developed towards harmony and stability.

TI  - Agricultural permanence in large Asian cities: a case study of Nanjing, China
T2  - ASIAN GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanjing, the capital of China's Jiangsu Province, has grown rapidly during the post-reform era and the pace of change placed tremendous pressure on the city's arable land resources. This case study of land use/land cover change (LU/LC) in Nanjing's Jiangning district assesses changes in agricultural land, production, and labor within the ten 2016-era jiedao (sub-district political units) of Jiangning from 2000 to 2015. This case study provides an opportunity to assess an important component of the Ginsburg-McGee desakota hypothesis predicting that Asian extended metropolis regions, unlike similar large cities in Western nations, will consistently maintain agricultural land and labor supplies within metropolitan boundaries. The study is based on field visits combined with time-series LU/LC analyses of a GIS database joining archived agricultural and agro-economic data with additional LU/LC data layers derived from satellite imagery including Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Results show Jiangning continues to retain high, if decreasing, proportions of agricultural land and employment. After significant decreases for all ten jiedao from 2000 to 2010, government policies appear to have helped stabilize arable land losses from 2010 to 2015. Jiedao in the closest proximity to Nanjing's central business districts lost arable land at greater rates than those in the periphery. OLS linear multiple regression analyses identified factors that are the most effective predictors of arable land persistence including lower mean annual income, higher percentage of men in the farm workforce, higher reliance on traditional double-cropped rice-wheat, and less vegetable production.

TI  - Evaluation of groundwater sustainability in the arid Hexi Corridor of Northwestern China, using GRACE, GLDAS and measured groundwater data products
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of groundwater resources is of great importance and has become crucial in the last few decades, especially in arid regions, where surface water resources are scarce and unreliable. The Hexi Corridor (HC) is one of the most agriculturally rich and densely populated areas of arid northwestern China. Increasing demand for water, due to rapid population growth, oasis expansion and urbanization, has increased groundwater use, resulting in wide-scale depletion in this region. Sustainable management of aquifers in the HC requires accurate estimates of the current situation of groundwater resource sustainability. In this work, groundwater storage anomaly (Delta GWS) were estimated using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data and the water-table fluctuation (WIT) method based on in-situ groundwater level data. Combined with the groundwater sustainability index (Slows), groundwater sustainability in the HC was then evaluated. Potential factors that could affect regional groundwater sustainability were analyzed by including and testing climate and socio-economic variables during the period of 1981 to 2016. We found that (1) groundwater in the HC has experienced a general deterioration (except for a sudden and sharp increase observed around 2002) in both storage and sustainability, from Delta GWS = 16.79 crn/year and SIGWS = 0.46 (1985-1990) to Delta GWS = -28.96 cm/year and SIGWS = 0.008 (2007-2016); (2) the lowest value of groundwater sustainability in the HC appeared in the central and eastern regions (SIGWS = 0); (3) human activity was confirmed to be the dominant factor driving the processes of deterioration in groundwater sustainability in the HC, and during the research period, it is striking that relatively limited "positive" effects of the water management project were detected on the regional groundwater resource; this result indicates that damaged groundwater sustainability cannot be easily reversed unless a long-term management policy is implemented. This study also proves that GRACE gravity satellite data has great application potential in groundwater sustainability evaluation in arid regions, especially in developing countries where in-situ data are scarce, and highlights the importance of joint management of surface water and groundwater, in groundwater sustainability management.
