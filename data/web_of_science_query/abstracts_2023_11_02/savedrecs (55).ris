TI  - Infectious disease activity during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan: Lessons learned from prevention and control measures <i>Commentary</i>
T2  - BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In Japan, the Law Concerning the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the "Infectious Diseases Control Law") classifies infectious diseases as category I-V infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and designated infectious diseases based on their infectivity, severity, and impact on public health. COVID-19 was designated as a designated infectious disease as of February 1, 2020 and then classified under pandemic influenza as of February 13, 2021. According to national reports from sentinel surveillance, some infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, contact, or orally declined during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. As of week 22 (June 6, 2021), there were 704 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 8,144 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 356 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 45 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis; these numbers were significantly lower than those last year, with 563,487 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 31,785 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 3,518 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 250 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similarly, many infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact declined in other countries and areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. One can reasonably assume that various measures adopted to control the transmission of COVID-19 have played a role in reducing the spread of other infectious diseases, and especially those transmitted by droplets or contact. Extensive and thorough implementation of personal protective measures and behavioral changes may serve as a valuable reference when identifying ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact in the future.

TI  - The use of RUSLE and GCMs to predict potential soil erosion associated with climate change in a monsoon-dominated region of eastern India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is one of the most important natural resources; therefore, there is an urgent need to estimate soil erosion. The subtropical monsoon-dominated region also faces a comparatively greater problem due to heavy rainfall with high intensity in a very short time and the presence of longer dry seasons and shorter wet seasons. The Arkosa watershed faces the problem of extreme land degradation in the form of soil erosion; therefore, the rate of soil erosion needs to be estimated according to appropriate models. GCM (general circulation model) data such as MIROC5 (Model for Interdisciplinary Climate Research) of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) have been used to project future storm rainfall and soil erosion rates following the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) in various influential time frames. Apart from that, different satellite data and relevant primary field-based data for future prediction were considered. The average annual soil erosion of Arkosa watershed ranges from < 1 to > 6 t/ha/year. The very high (> 6 t/ha/year) and high (5-6 t/ha/year) soil loss areas are found in the southern, south-eastern, and eastern part of the watershed. Apart from this, low (1-2 t/ha/year) and very low (< 1 t/ha/year) soil loss areas are associated with the western, northern, southern, and major portion of the watershed. Extreme precipitation rates with high kinetic energy due to climate change are favorable to soil erosion susceptibility. The results of this research will help to implement management strategies to minimize soil erosion by keeping authorities and researchers at risk for future erosion and vulnerability.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Cumulatively to 27 September there have been 27,095 case notifications and 835 deaths. The number of new cases reported nationally this fortnight was 278, a 67% decrease from the previous fortnight (841). On average, this represented 20 cases notified each day over the reporting period, a decrease from an average of 60 cases per day over the previous reporting period. 82% of all COVID-19 cases for the period (229/278) were reported in Victoria, with smaller numbers of cases reported from New South Wales (32), Western Australia (9), Queensland (6) and South Australia (2). In Victoria, 92% of cases (210/229) were locally acquired with known source, 7% (15/229) were locally acquired with unknown source, and 2% (4/229) were reported as under investigation. Excluding Victoria, there were 49 cases in other jurisdictions. Of these, 69% (34/49) were overseas acquired, 18% (9/49) were locally acquired, and 12% (10/49) were under investigation at this time. The continued decrease in new cases observed this fortnight in Victoria was the result of the public health interventions to minimise transmission. A total of 8 deaths were reported from cases diagnosed in this reporting period, all of whom were >75 years old, and all from Victoria. Although testing rates declined over the past month, they remain high at 10.4 tests per 1,000 population per week. There is variability in the testing rate by jurisdiction; the rate depends on the epidemic context. The overall positivity rate for the reporting period was 0.08%. Victoria reported a positivity rate of 0.18% for this reporting period, while in all other jurisdictions the positivity rate was 0.05% or lower.

TI  - Using governance and patient flow strategies to improve healthcare service efficiency
T2  - AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this case study was to share lessons learned regarding strategies likely to increase healthcare service efficiency. Following quality assurance review of statewide Hospital in the Home (HITH) average length of stay (ALOS) and readmission data, Queensland's Department of Health observed that for some of the highest volume diagnoses seen in Queensland's HITH services in 2017, services that used a public-private partnership (PPP) model of care achieved a shorter ALOS than services using a traditional public model of care without demonstrably poorer patient outcomes. To understand the reasons for the differences in ALOS, ALOS and readmission data from 2017 for 10 high-volume diagnoses were retrospectively compared for five HITH services. Two of the services used a PPP and three used a public HITH model of care. Additional data were collected to determine similarities and points of difference regarding how the services operated in 2017. Hospitals that used a PPP HITH model of care achieved shorter ALOS for eight of the 10 diagnoses, with the difference ranging from 0.94 to 5.98 days. Differences between how the PPP and public HITH services operated in 2017 were identified. The findings suggest that the use of governance strategies, criteria-led discharge and financial incentives is likely to support safe shorter lengths of stay. What is known about the topic? Although sometimes challenging to implement and sustain, the use of governance and patient flow strategies is reported in the literature to support efficient healthcare service delivery. What does this paper add? An opportunity to compare the efficiency outcomes of two different models of care that were implemented for the same service type concurrently statewide, and where the trial lasted for 4 years, is rare. Review of the learnings from this study may be useful to inform the design of efficient healthcare services. In addition, this paper contains information that may be helpful to those who wish to set up or evaluate a HITH service, or, enter into a PPP. What are the implications for practitioners? (1) The use of patient flow strategies warrant prioritisation as using them is likely to improve service efficiency. (2) The processes employed to collect, review and use data to govern and make decisions should be carefully considered as they also are likely to affect efficiency. (3) Funding models can be used to influence efficiency.

TI  - Completely resected stage III melanoma controversy - 15 years of national tertiary centre experience.
T2  - Radiology and oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background Two prospective randomized studies analysing cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases and rapid development of systemic adjuvant therapy have changed our approach to stage III CM treatment. The aim of this study was to compare results of retrospective survival analysis of stage III CM patients' treatment from Slovenian national CM register to leading international clinical guidelines. Patients and methods Since 2000, all Slovenian CM patients with primary tumour ≥ TIb are treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana and data are prospectively collected into a national CM registry. A retrospective analysis of 2426 sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies and 789 lymphadenectomies performed until 2015 was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests. Results Positive SLN was found in 519/2426 (21.4%) of patients and completion dissection (CLND) was performed in 455 patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of CLND group was 58% vs. 47% of metachronous metastases group (MLNM) (p = 0.003). The 5-year OS of patients with lymph node (LN) metastases and unknown primary site (UPM) was 45% vs. 21% of patients with synchronous LN metastasis. Patients with SLN tumour burden < 0.3 mm had 5-year OS similar to SLN negative patients (86% vs. 85%; p = 0.926). The 5-year OS of patients with burden > 1.0 mm was similar to the MLNM group (49% vs. 47%; p = 0.280). Conclusions Stage III melanoma patients is a heterogeneous group with significant OS differences. CLND after positive SLNB might still remain a method of treatment for selected patients with stage III.

TI  - Determining paddy field spatiotemporal distribution and temperature influence using remote sensing in Songnen Plain, Northeastern China
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates changes in the spatial distributions of paddy fields in the Songnen Plain (China's largest commodity grain-producing area) using the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-Vegetation (SPOT VEGETATION) time series product data to simulate the phenological characteristics of paddy rice growth. According to the analysis, the characteristics of paddy fields are different from other vegetation cover around late May (15th 10-day). This difference can be used to improve accuracy in identifying paddy fields. Historical maps (1999-2013) are extracted successfully in this work. Based on the results, a trend map for changes in paddy field areas is generated using a 10-km grid. Based on the verification of paddy field extractions in 2019 using the Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA VEGETATION), the trend map is strongly indicative for predicting future spatial distribution changes of paddy fields. These results can be used to provide a reliable theoretical basis for environmental research related to the growth of paddy rice. This study also verifies that paddy rice cultivation is one of the main causes of rising temperatures in the study area.

TI  - Alewife (<i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i>) spawning and nursery areas in a sentinel estuary: spatial and temporal patterns
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal distribution of anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharengusWilson) spawning and nursery habitats were determined by sampling in the Mullica River - Great Bay watershed (New Jersey, USA) in a combination of long- and short-term observational and quantitative studies. Reproduction was confirmed by examination of developing gonads, visual observations of spawning, and egg collections. Spawning typically lasted 2-4 days in discrete waves in freshwater tributaries from late March to late April. Nursery habitats for larvae and young-of-the-year alewife included low-salinity tributaries near the freshwater-saltwater interface and high salinity waters through early fall before departure to the ocean in late fall. Predation on eggs by fish predators, especially American eel (Anguilla rostrataLesueur), occurred below a dam. This predation was also observed in the laboratory on eggs and larvae. These findings point out that this dam provided for enhanced predation on alewife early life history stages, and may cause an ecological hotspot for predation-prey interactions for this anadromous species and its catadromous predator.

TI  - Estimation of global solar radiation data based on satellite-derived atmospheric parameters over the urban area of Mashhad, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global solar radiation is the total amount of solar energy received on a horizontal surface and defined as the sum of direct, diffused, and reflected solar radiation. Global solar radiation is an important variable in agricultural, meteorological, hydrological, and climatological studies. The purpose of this paper is to develop an effective method to estimate the daily global solar radiation using different atmospheric properties detected from satellite data, including cloud fraction, cloud optical depth, aerosol optical depth, aerosol exponent, aerosol index, and precipitable water vapor from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) daytime data in the urban area of Mashhad, Iran, during the years from 2000 to 2018. Based on seven combinations of the atmospheric properties, models were developed using a standard statistical method, namely, multiple linear regression method and a specific class of artificial neural networks, namely, feedforward multilayer perceptron. The efficiency of the models was compared for the assessment of the daily global solar radiation based on the combinations of the input data. For both methods, 80% percent of the data are used for model development and the remaining data for validation. Results of pairwise statistics indicate that, on average, the estimates were more accurate using the artificial neural networks than the regression method. Results show that in both methods, the accuracy of estimation improves when cloud fraction is used as a predictor. This implies the significant effect of cloud cover on solar radiation. However, using the cloud optical depth decreases the accuracy of the estimation of global solar radiation, i.e., the least accurate model is the one with cloud fraction and cloud optical depth for the neural network method and the model with CF and AE for the regression method. The estimation error comes from the inaccuracy in measuring cloud optical depth that depends on satellite sensor resolution and the inhomogeneity of types and microphysical properties of clouds over the study area. Due to the arid climate of the study area, the precipitable water vapor content does not considerably affect radiation attenuation. The best estimate is earned by cloud fraction and aerosol index as inputs indicating the simultaneous role of aerosol and cloud in global solar radiation. Aerosol index considers the effect of absorbing aerosols such as black carbon and dust and is a complementary information to the cloud cover. The results imply that both methods have the potential to achieve an operational stage, taking advantage of the better availability of satellite data. Even though the artificial neural network is found to be more accurate than multiple linear regression, using the regression method is recommended because it is more easy to use. Results show that the effective variables vary in different seasons. In both methods, estimation error is highest in the spring and lowest in the fall and winter. The high inaccuracy may be due to the high sensitivity of radiative transfer to atmospheric condition in spring. On the other hand, the high accuracy may be caused by the less solar radiation fluctuations during fall and winter because of the lower solar radiation flux.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter protects mosquito larvae from damaging solar UV radiation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquitoes have increased in their abundance and geographic distribution in northeastern North America, coinciding with an increase in extreme precipitation events and up to a doubling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations in some inland waters. Increases in DOM can reduce exposure of mosquito larvae to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Although mosquito larvae are most common in shaded habitats, almost nothing is known about their susceptibility to damage by solar UV radiation, or the ability of DOM to create a refuge from damaging UV in their shallow-water habitats. We hypothesize that 1) exposure to solar UV radiation is lethal to mosquito larvae, 2) larvae lack photo-enzymatic repair to fix UV-damaged DNA, and 3) DOM shades larvae from lethal solar UV radiation. We tested these hypotheses with experiments that manipulated UV radiation, the photo-repair radiation necessary for photo-enzymatic DNA repair, and DOM. Exposure to solar UV radiation significantly decreased larval survivorship, while DOM significantly increased it. There was no evidence of photo-enzymatic DNA repair. Our findings confirm that solar UV radiation decreases habitat suitability for mosquito larvae, but DOM provides a refuge from UV. This highlights the need for vector control managers to prioritize high DOM and shaded habitats in their efforts to reduce mosquito populations.

TI  - Enhanced axillary assessment using intradermally injected microbubbles and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) before neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NACT) identifies axillary disease missed by conventional B-mode ultrasound that may be clinically relevant
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to measure pre-treatment diagnostic yield of malignant lymph nodes (LN) using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in addition to B-mode axillary ultrasound and compare clinicopathological features, response to NACT and long-term outcomes of patients with malignant LN detected with B-mode ultrasound versus CEUS. Methods Between August 2009 and October 2016, NACT patients were identified from a prospective database. Follow-up data were collected until May 2019. Results 288 consecutive NACT patients were identified; 77 were excluded, 110 had malignant LN identified by B-mode ultrasound (Group A) and 101 patients with negative B-mode axillary ultrasound had CEUS with biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). In two cases CEUS failed. Malignant SLN were identified in 35/99 (35%) of B-mode ultrasound-negative cases (Group B). Patients in Group A were similar to those in Group B in age, mean diagnostic tumour size, grade and oestrogen receptor status. More Group A patients had a ductal phenotype. In the breast, 34 (31%) Group A patients and 8 (23%) Group B patients achieved a pathological complete response (PCR). In the axilla, 41 (37%) and 13 (37%) Groups A and B patients, respectively, had LN PCR. The systemic relapse rate was not statistically different (5% and 16% for Groups A and B, respectively). Conclusions Enhanced assessment with CEUS before NACT identifies patients with axillary metastases missed by conventional B-mode ultrasound.

TI  - Intussusception in children aged under two years in India: Retrospective surveillance at nineteen tertiary care hospitals
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Intussusception has been linked with rotavirus vaccine (RVV) as a rare adverse reaction. In view of limited background data on intussusception in India and in preparation for RVV introduction, a surveillance network was established to document the epidemiology of intussusception cases in Indian children.Methods: Intussusception in children 2-23 months were documented at 19 nationally representative sentinel hospitals through a retrospective surveillance for 69 months (July 2010 to March 2016). For each case clinical, hospital course, treatment and outcome data were collected.Results: Among the 1588 intussusception cases, 54.5% were from South India and 66.3% were boys. The median age was 8 months (IQR 6, 12) with 34.6% aged 2-6 months. Seasonal variation with higher cases were documented during March-June period. The most common symptoms and signs were vomiting (63.4%), bloody stool (49.1%), abdominal pain (46.9%) and excessive crying (42.8%). The classical triad (vomiting, abdominal pain, and blood in stools) was observed in 25.6% cases. 96.4% cases were diagnosed by ultrasound with ileocolic location as the commonest (85.3%). Management was done by reduction (50.8%) and surgery (41.1%) and only 1% of the patients' died. 91.1% cases met Brighton criteria level 1 and 3.3% Level 2. Between 2010 and 2015, the case load and case ratio increased across all regions.Conclusion: Intussusception cases have occurred in children across all parts of the country, with low case fatality in the settings studied. The progressive rise cases could indicate an increasing awareness and availability of diagnostic facilities. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The burden of legionnaires' disease in Belgium, 2013 to 2017
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a severe bacterial infection causing pneumonia. Surveillance commonly underestimates the true incidence as not all cases are laboratory confirmed and reported to public health authorities. The aim of this study was to present indicators for the impact of LD in Belgium between 2013 and 2017 and to estimate its true burden in the Belgian population in 2017, the most recent year for which the necessary data were available. Methods Belgian hospital discharge data, data from three infectious disease surveillance systems (mandatory notification, sentinel laboratories and the national reference center), information on reimbursed diagnostic tests from the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance and mortality data from the Belgian statistical office were used. To arrive at an estimate of the total number of symptomatic cases in Belgium, we defined a surveillance pyramid and estimated a multiplication factor to account for LD cases not captured by surveillance. The multiplication factor was then applied to the pooled number of LD cases reported by the three surveillance systems. This estimate was the basis for our hazard- and incidence-based Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) calculation. To account for uncertainty in the estimations of the DALYs and the true incidence, we used Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations. Results We found an average of 184 LD cases reported by Belgian hospitals annually (2013-2017), the majority of which were male (72%). The surveillance databases reported 215 LD cases per year on average, 11% of which were fatal within 90 days after diagnosis. The estimation of the true incidence in the community yielded 2674 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 2425-2965) cases in 2017. LD caused 3.05 DALYs per case (95%UI: 1.67-4.65) and 8147 (95%UI: 4453-12,426) total DALYs in Belgium in 2017, which corresponds to 71.96 (95%UI: 39.33-109.75) DALYs per 100,000 persons. Conclusions This analysis revealed a considerable burden of LD in Belgium that is vastly underestimated by surveillance data. Comparison with other European DALY estimates underlines the impact of the used data sources and methodological approaches on burden estimates, illustrating that national burden of disease studies remain essential.

TI  - Dynamics of forage and land cover changes in Teltele district of Borana rangelands, southern Ethiopia: using geospatial and field survey data
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The gradual conversion of rangelands into other land use types is one of the main challenges affecting the sustainable management of rangelands in Teltele. This study aimed to examine the changes, drivers, trends in land use and land cover (LULC), to determine the link between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and forage biomass and the associated impacts of forage biomass production dynamics on the Teltele rangelands in Southern Ethiopia. A Combination of remote sensing data, field interviews, discussion and observations data were used to examine the dynamics of LULC between 1992 and 2019 and forage biomass production. Results The result indicate that there is a marked increase in farm land (35.3%), bare land (13.8%) and shrub land (4.8%), while the reduction found in grass land (54.5%), wet land (69.3%) and forest land (10.5%). The larger change in land observed in both grassland and wetland part was observed during the period from 1995-2000 and 2015-2019, this is due to climate change impact (El-Nino) happened in Teltele rangeland during the year 1999 and 2016 respectively. The quantity of forage in different land use/cover types, grass land had the highest average amount of forage biomass of 2092.3 kg/ha, followed by wetland with 1231 kg/ha, forest land with 1191.3 kg/ha, shrub land with 180 kg/ha, agricultural land with 139.5 kg/ha and bare land with 58.1 kg/ha. Conclusions The significant linkage observed between NDVI and LULC change types (when a high NDVI value, the LULC changes also shows positive value or an increasing trend). In addition, NDVI value directly related to the greenness status of vegetation occurred on each LULC change types and its value directly linkage forage biomass production pattern with grassland land use types. 64.8% (grass land), 43.3% (agricultural land), 75.1% (forest land), 50.6% (shrub land), 80.5% (bare land) and 75.5% (wet land) more or higher dry biomass production in the wet season compared to the dry season.

TI  - Coastal sea level rise at Senetosa (Corsica) during the Jason altimetry missions
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the ESA Climate Change Initiative project, we are engaged in a regional reprocessing of high-resolution (20 Hz) altimetry data of the classical missions in a number of the world's coastal zones. It is done using the ALES (Adaptive Leading Edge Subwave-form) retracker combined with the X-TRACK system dedicated to improve geophysical corrections at the coast. Using the Jason-1 and Jason-2 satellite data, high-resolution, along-track sea level time series have been generated, and coastal sea level trends have been computed over a 14-year time span (from July 2002 to June 2016). In this paper, we focus on a particular coastal site where the Jason track crosses land, Senetosa, located south of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea, for two reasons: (1) the rate of sea level rise estimated in this project increases significantly in the last 4-5 km to the coast compared to what is observed further offshore, and (2) Senetosa is the calibration site for the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason altimetry missions, which are equipped for that purpose with in situ instrumentation, in particular tide gauges and a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna. A careful examination of all the potential errors that could explain the increased rate of sea level rise close to the coast (e.g., spurious trends in the geophysical corrections, imperfect inter-mission bias estimate, decrease of valid data close to the coast and errors in waveform retracking) has been carried out, but none of these effects appear able to explain the trend increase. We further explored the possibility that it results from real physical processes. Change in wave conditions was investigated, but wave setup was excluded as a potential contributor because the magnitude was too low and too localized in the immediate vicinity of the shoreline. A preliminary model-based investigation about the contribution of coastal currents indicates that it could be a plausible explanation of the observed change in sea level trend close to the coast.

TI  - Linking Chlorophyll Concentration and Wind Patterns Using Satellite Data in the Central and Northern California Current System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The California Current System (CCS) is a highly productive region because of wind driven upwelling, which supplies nutrients to the euphotic zone. Numerous studies of the relationship between phytoplankton productivity and wind patterns suggest that an intermediate wind speed yields the most productivity on the shelf. However, few studies have considered the productivity-wind relationship across the entire CCS, including the Northern CCS (north of 42 degrees N), an unusually productive region with highly variable upwellingand downwelling-favorable winds. Using satellite chlorophyll concentration from GlobColour together with QuikSCAT and ASCAT winds, we examine the relationship between shelf (shallower than the 150 m isobath) chlorophyll concentration and wind patterns in the Central and Northern CCS. Results from this empirical analysis suggest that while there is a dome-shaped relationship between mean chlorophyll concentration and wind stress for the whole system, the Central CCS and Northern CCS have significantly different relationships, which is evident in the separation between their mean chlorophyll concentration-wind stress curves. The Northern CCS also supports high chlorophyll concentration during downwelling-favorable winds. To understand this difference in chlorophyll concentration-wind stress relationships, results from particle tracking experiments using a ROMS model of the Northern CCS are used to map shelf retention times with respect to wind patterns. These results suggest that on the 1 degrees-latitude scale, the effect of wind intermittency on retention is minimal in the Northern CCS; however, this result does not disqualify the influence of more complex controls on retention like wind intermittency on smaller spatial scales. Lastly, we present a revised hypothesis to describe the relationship between chlorophyll concentration and wind stress in the CCS that includes the influence of non-upwelling-derived nutrients in the Northern CCS.

TI  - Role of carbon nanoparticle suspension in sentinel lymph node biopsy for early-stage cervical cancer: a prospective study
T2  - BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical diagnostic validity of carbon nanoparticle suspension (CNS) in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for assessing lymphatic spread of early-stage cervical cancer. Design A prospective study. Setting and population 356 cases. Methods We enrolled 356 stage Ia2-IIa2 cervical cancer patients to undergo SLNB using CNS, followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. All lymph node specimens were assessed using conventional histopathologic +/- pathologic ultrastaging analyses. Main outcome measures Sentinel lymph node detection rate (DR), clinical diagnostic validity and various related factors were analysed. Results CNS identified 1456 SLNs in 325 patients. The overall SLN DR was 91.29%. A significantly higher DR was found for patients with tumours <20 mm (97.75% versus 71.91%;P < 0.001). Two patients had false-negative results. SLNB with CNS had sensitivity of 96.65%, false-negative rate (FNR) of 4.35% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.29%. Importantly, sensitivity (100%), NPV (100%) and FNR (0%) were improved when testing the subgroup of patients with tumours <20 mm (267 cases). There were no observed differences in DR based on pathological type or grade, stage, depth of stromal invasion, surgical approach, menopausal status or prior treatment with chemotherapy (P > 0.05). Conclusions Sentinel lymph node biopsy with CNS results in favourable DR, sensitivity and NPV for women with early-stage cervical cancer with small tumour sizes. SLNB with CNS is safe, feasible and relatively effective for guiding precise surgical treatment of early-stage cervical cancer. Tweetable abstract Sentinel lymph node biopsy with carbon nanoparticle suspension is safe and feasible for early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>Mass Concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on Geographically Weighted Regression and Spatial Downscaling Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a common method to estimate mass concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, some shortage like spatial resolution of the raster input model still exists widely in the model. Therefore, based on GWR model, we adopted spatial downscaling (SD) method to solve this problem. GWR and SD were constructed by using Aerosol Optical Depth remote sensing data, GEOF meteorological grid data of the Goddard Earth Observing System, and PM(2.5)data from the ground environmental monitoring station. In this study, GWR and SD were used to estimate monthly PM(2.5)mass concentrations of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in 2017. The results showed that: the average annual PM(2.5)in 2017 estimated by GWR and SD had the characteristics of high in the south and low in the north with the boundary of 40 degrees N in the spatial distribution. We found that the natural proximity method was the optimal choice for the treatment of residual values through verification of the estimated results. At the 95% confidence level, the determination coefficientR(2)is 0.903, the mean prediction error is 7.307 mu g/m(3), the root mean square error is 11.62 mu g/m(3), and the relative prediction error is 18.35%. These results suggest that the GWR and SD method could objectively estimate PM(2.5)mass concentrations in BTH region in 2017 and process raster data into the same spatial resolution.

TI  - Does methylene blue increases capsular contracture in immediate breast reconstruction with silicone implant? An experimental study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY AND HAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, most of the immediate breast reconstructions following mastectomy are being carried out with the use of silicone implants. In these patients, methylene blue is being used for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. This experimental study was performed to determine the effect of methylene blue on capsular contracture around breast implants. Thirty-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Custom made silicone blocks were placed on the back of animals. In group 1, the incision was closed without performing any additional procedure. In group 2 (control), 0.1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was instilled into the pocket. Group 3 and 4 (study groups) received 0.1 and 0.2 mL of 1% methylene blue, respectively. On postoperative day 60, implants and capsular tissue were extracted. Capsule formation was evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. The histological evaluation included capsule thickness, inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis gradients. Regarding capsule thickness, there were statistically significant differences between groups 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, and 2-4. Although there were more moderate and severe inflammation gradients in groups III and IV, there was no significant difference regarding inflammation severity between control and study groups. In respect of vascular proliferation, there was a statistically significant difference between control and study groups. Similarly, fibrosis gradients were higher in both groups 3 and 4. The study showed that the injection of methylene blue around silicone implants enhanced the formation of capsular contracture. In this case, the degree of contracture was independent of the dose given.

TI  - Different refuge types dampen exotic invasion and enhance diversity at the whole ecosystem scale in a heterogeneous river system
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Refuges that result from environmental heterogeneity within ecosystems have an important yet under-appreciated role in maintaining native community diversity in face of exotic invasion. The objective of our study was to determine if different refuge types constrain invasion impacts on native biodiversity at the whole ecosystem-scale of the Upper St. Lawrence River. We focused on the voracious round goby fish as a sentinel exotic species whose spatial distribution within this ecosystem is also representative of the species distributions of several other Ponto-Caspian invaders. We first explored if wetlands were acting as unknown refuges in reducing the local abundance of the round goby fish. We then tested the relative influence of a known broad-scale conductivity gradient compared with local wetlands on structuring the composition, diversity, and abundance of native macroinvertebrate and fish communities inside and outside each of these refuge types. We found that the two types of refuges, broad-scale conductivity gradient and local wetlands, limited round goby abundances at the whole ecosystem scale, and structured macroinvertebrate and fish community diversity. The broad-scale conductivity refuge was twice stronger than wetlands in limiting round goby abundance. Although wetlands were effective in constraining round goby abundance, the direct effect of wetlands rather than their indirect effects through limiting round goby abundance, were more powerful in explaining maintenance of macroinvertebrate and fish community diversity in invaded high conductivity waters. Our findings underscore the important role of environmental heterogeneity in producing different types of refuges that buffer invasion effects in freshwater ecosystems, and we advocate the preservation of wetlands as a part of this process.

TI  - Blood biomarkers for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the presence and absence of sentinel events
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine if neonatal serum biomarkers representing different pathways of injury differ for cases of HIE of unknown cause to gain insight into timing and mechanism of injury. Study design In this cohort of all neonates with HIE admitted to our NICU, newborns with sentinel events were compared to those without during the 1st 3 days of life. Discard neonatal blood during the 1st 3 days of life was used for analysis. Results Of 277 babies with HIE treated with whole-body hypothermia, 190 (68.6%) had blood available for biomarker analysis. In total, 71 (37.4%) were born within our system, and 119 (62.6%) were transferred in from outside hospitals. Of these babies, 77 (40.5%) had a sentinel event and 113 (59.6%) had no sentinel event. Although the degree of metabolic acidosis was similar, repeated measures analysis showed that during the initial 3 days of life neonates born with HIE in the absence of sentinel events had 41.4% decreased VEGF (p = 0.027) and 62.5% increased IL-10 serum concentrations (p = 0.005). Conclusion These changes indicate that neonatal HIE in the absence of sentinel events is not related to an unrecognized acute intrapartum event and is possibly related to chronic hypoxia of lower severity or recovery from a remote event.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of decadal landuse change on the water balance components using soil and water assessment tool in Ghaggar river basin
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The landuse and landcover change is considered as one of the most vital components of the global environmental change responsible for influencing the quantity, seasonal patterns and durations of the water flow within basins around the world. The aim of this study is to assess the impacts of changes in landuse landcover on the various hydrological components for Ghaggar river basin for a period of 1985-2015 using Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. The landuse landcover maps have been prepared using various Landsat satellite images for the year 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015.The fixing changing method has been employed to quantify the impacts of landuse changes on hydrological components by changing the landuse maps of different year and keeping rest of the inputs same. The correlation and Partial Least square regression are used to examine the impacts of change in landuse on the hydrological components. The results unveiled that the increase in agriculture and built-up area and decrease in area of evergreen, deciduous and mixed forest. During the period 1985-2015 there is increase in annual stream flow (0.20%), wet season streamflow (1.55%), surface runoff (12.23%) and water yield (0.22%) on the contrary there is decrease in dry season streamflow (2.1%), Evapotranspiration (0.08%), groundwater flow (8.62%), Percolation (8.02%) and lateral flow (3.92%) owing to changes in landuse landcover. There is an urgent need to adopt soil and water conservation practices in the area to avert these deleterious effects of landuse landcover changes.

TI  - Integrating thermal stress indexes within Shuttleworth-Wallace model for evapotranspiration mapping over a complex surface
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this work was to evaluate the potential of the Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) model for mapping actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) over complex surface located in the foothill of the Atlas Mountain (Morocco). This model needs many input variables to compute soil (r(s)(s)) and vegetation (r(s)(v)) resistances, which are often difficult to estimate at large scale particularly soil moisture. In this study, a new approach to spatialize r(s)(s) and r(s)(v) based on two thermal-based proxy variables was proposed. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat data were combined with the endmember temperatures for soil (Ts-min and Ts-max) and vegetation (Tv(min) and Tv(max)), which were simulated by a surface energy balance model, to compute the soil (Ts) and the vegetation (Tv) temperatures. Based on these temperatures, two thermal proxies (SIss for soil and SIsv for vegetation) were calculated and related to r(s)(s) and r(s)(v), with an empirical exponential relationship [with a correlation coefficient (R) of about 0.6 and 0.5 for soil and vegetation, respectively]. The proposed approach was initially evaluated at a local scale, by comparing the results to observations by an eddy covariance system installed over an area planted with olive trees intercropped with wheat. In a second step, the new approach was applied over a large area which contains a mixed vegetation (tall and short) crossed by a river to derive r(s)(s) and r(s) (v), and thereafter to estimate ET. A Large aperture scintillometer (LAS) installed over a line transect of 1.4 km and spanning the total area was used to validate the obtained ET. The comparison confirmed the ability of the proposed approach to provide satisfactory ET maps with an RMSE, bias and R-2 equal to 0.08 mm/h, 0.06 mm/h and 0.80, respectively.

TI  - Lynch syndrome (HNPCC syndrome)
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is one of the most frequent hereditary cancer syndromes. In many affected women the first LS-associated malignancy (so-called sentinel carcinoma) is endometrial and/or ovarian cancer, usually at a younger age than in sporadic cases. Although these tumors tend to have a good prognosis, the responsible gynecologist should recognize them as a signal for LS and initiate adequate screening procedures for LS. If positive, genetic counselling and germline testing should be recommended. Carriers of LS mutations should be offered intensified gastroenterological surveillance as well as genetic counselling and testing (cascade testing) of their families. The options and limitations of intensified gynecological surveillance and prophylactic surgery should be discussed with affected women. They should be managed in collaboration with centers qualified for the diagnostics, screening, treatment, surveillance and prevention of hereditary cancer syndromes.

TI  - Dehesa environment mapping with transference of a Random Forest classifier to neighboring ultra-high spatial resolution imagery at class and macro-class land cover levels
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate vegetation cover maps of forested areas are crucial for ecosystems monitoring, as well as for management of water balance, flood and fire risk, and other forest-associated resources. With this regard, remote sensing techniques have been used for land cover mapping worldwide. Here, we propose a vegetation-mapping methodology in adehesaenvironment using ultra-high spatial resolution imagery (UHSR) with a spatial resolution of 0.25 m and four bands in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Land cover categories were defined by their runoff generation capability and considered two levels of disaggregation: among species (macro-class level) and within species (class level). Additionally, we developed a method to reduce field campaigns and manual work by transferring random forest classifiers trained with a group of images (training group) to neighboring images (validation group). The training group was remarkably accurate, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.6% (k = 0.89) at the class level and 95.8% (k = 0.94) at the macro-class level. The results for the validation group were also very high, with an overall accuracy of 78.3% (k = 0.74) at the class level and 86.3% (k = 0.82) at the macro-class level. Moreover, we found that the blue band, soil color index, and texture features have a great influence on species discrimination, especially within shrub species indehesaenvironments. Notably, having accurate land cover maps is crucial, given that the use of a global database led to underestimating the potential runoff in the most representative land cover in thedehesaenvironment. Future research will focus on the automatic generation of new samples extracted from the classified UHSR images, which could be used as training datasets for the supervised classification of other high spatial resolution images (e.g., Sentinel imagery) for regional-scale hydrological models.

TI  - A multicentre prospective feasibility study of carbon dye tattooing of biopsied axillary node and surgical localisation in breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The primary aim of this prospective, multicentre feasibility study was to determine whether the biopsied axillary node can be marked using black carbon dye and successfully identified at the time of surgery. Methods We included breast cancer patients undergoing needle biopsy of the axillary node. The biopsied node was tattooed at the time of needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration or core biopsy) or at a separate visit with black carbon dye (Spot (R) or Black Eye (TM)). Participants underwent primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and axillary surgery (SNB or ALND) as per routine care. Results 110 patients were included. Median age of the women was 59 (range 31-88) years. 48 (44%) underwent SNB and 62 (56%) ALND. Median volume of dye injected was 2.0 ml (range 0.2-4.2). Tattooed node was identified intra-operatively in 90 (82%) patients. The identification rate was higher (76 of 88, 86%) in the primary surgery group compared with NACT (14 of 22, 64%) (p = 0.03). Of those undergoing NACT, the identification rate was better in the patients undergoing SNB (3 of 4, 75%) compared with ALND (11 of 18, 61%) (p > 0.99). The tattooed node was the sentinel node in 78% (28 of 36) patients in the primary surgery group and 100% (3 of 3) in the NACT group. There was no learning curve for surgeons or radiologists. The identification rate did not vary with timing between dye injection and surgery (p = 0.56), body mass index (p = 0.62) or volume of dye injected (p = 0.25). Conclusion It is feasible to mark the axillary node with carbon dye and identify it intra-operatively. ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03640819.

TI  - Improving ANN-based streamflow estimation models for the Upper Indus Basin using satellite-derived snow cover area
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous catchments often witness contrasting regimes and the limited available meteorological network creates uncertainty in both the hydrological data and developed models. To overcome this problem, remotely sensed data could be used in addition to on-ground observations for hydrological forecasting. The fusion of these two types of data gives a better picture and helps to generate adequate hydrological forecasting models. The study aims at the improvement of ANN-based streamflow estimation models by using an integrated data-set containing, the satellite-derived snow cover area (SCA) with on-ground flow observations. For this purpose, SCA of three sub catchments of Upper Indus Basin, namely Gilgit, Astore and Bunji coupled with their respective gauge discharges is used as model inputs. The weekly stream-flow models are developed for inflows at Besham Qila located just upstream of Tarbela dam. The data-set for modeling is prepared through normalizing all variables by scaling between 0 and 1. A mathematical tool, Gamma test is applied to fuse the inputs, and a best input combination is selected on the basis of minimum gamma value. A feed forward neural network trained via two layer Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno algorithm is used for model development. The models are evaluated on the basis of set of performance indicators, namely, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, Root Mean Square Error, Variance and BIAS. A comparative assessment has also been made using these indicators for models developed, through data-set containing gauge discharges, only and the data-set fused with satellite-derived SCA. In particular, the current study concluded that the efficiency of ANN-based streamflow estimation models developed for mountainous catchments could be improved by integrating the SCA with the gauge discharges.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Acral Melanoma in Chinese and Caucasian Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SKIN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Acral melanoma (AM) is a rare subtype of melanoma, which is one of the least common in Caucasian patients but is a common subtype of melanoma in Chinese patients. It is unclear if prognosis differs between Chinese and Caucasian patients diagnosed with AM. The aim of our study is to investigate patient characteristics and survival differences between Chinese and Caucasian AM patients.Methods. Two large institutional melanoma databases from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and Mayo Clinic enterprise were retrospectively reviewed from 2009 to 2015. Clinicopathologic and survival data were collected and analyzed between the two groups. The primary outcome was disease-specific survival (DSS) and was calculated using the Kaplan Meier (KM) method.Results. The Chinese group presented with more advanced disease compared with Caucasians: thicker Breslow depth (median 3.0 mm vs. 1.2 mm,p=0.003), more ulcerated disease (66.1% vs. 29%;p<0.001), and advanced stages (stage II/III 84.3% vs. 37.1%;p<0.001). No significant difference was identified in terms of age at diagnosis, location, histologic subtypes, or node positive rate. The 5-year DSS rate was 68.4% and 73% (p=0.56) in Chinese and Caucasians AM patients, respectively. Male gender, Breslow thickness, ulceration, and positive sentinel lymph nodes were independent poor prognostic factors on multivariate analysis.Conclusions. There appears to be no difference in stage-stratified survival between Chinese and Caucasians, supporting the implementation of clinical trials for AM that could include both Chinese and Caucasian patients.

TI  - Geo-informatics based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) through analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for forest fire risk mapping in Palamau Tiger Reserve, Jharkhand state, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires constitute a foremost environmental calamity that distresses the sustainability of the forest. The main source of degradation of Jharkhand forests are forest fires conquered by forest species of Sal and Bamboo. Palamau Tiger Reserve in Jharkhand state, India, is becoming more susceptible to forest fire due to anthropogenic disturbance coupled with speedy upsurge in population. In this study, forest fire risk in PTR was evaluated based on various fire inducing factors, viz., forest fuel, settlements, roads, bare soil index, elevation slope and aspect. Geoinformatics based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) through method of AHP (analytic hierarchy process) used to extract forest fire risk map in five classes: Very low risk, low risk, moderate risk, high risk and very high risk. The results obtained showed that about 180 km(2)(14.85%) falls under very low fire risk zone, 234 km(2)(19.30%) falls in low fire risk zone, 269.73 km(2)(22.16%) falls under moderate fire risk zone, 299.36 km(2)(24.59%) falls under high fire risk zone and 232.56 km(2)(19.10%) falls in very high fire risk zone. Forest fire risk map was validated from historical fire incidents observed through field data, MODIS and SNPP-VIIRS satellite products. The results showed that the geoinformatics based forest fire risk zones delineated through MCDA-AHP method are in good agreement with historical forest fire occurrences, henceforth may be utilised for fire planning for mitigation in forest areas.

TI  - Hydrogeomorphic assessment of badlands in part of the Mandakini River watershed, Chitrakoot, India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Badlands are a hydrogeomorphological feature with operative processes leading to intense erosion. This study utilizes the morphometric methods with the help of remote sensing data in a GIS environment to determine the characteristics of the badlands of Mandakini River watershed and their interpretation to explore the factors responsible for the formation of the typical landforms. Objective interpretation of morphometric data of badlands with the help of statistical Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and dendrogram cluster may be made to emphasize the controlling factors. The morphometric parameters like the total number of streams (Nu), bifurcation ratio (Rb), drainage density (Dd), drainage frequency (Fs), drainage texture (Dt), and infiltration number (If) and their correlation in the study area plays a significant role in the advancement of rills and gullies. In the present area, the total number of streams (Nu) is very significantly related with the lengths of the first-order (L1), the second-order (L2), and the third-order streams (L3) along with the total stream length of all orders (Lu) in the third-order and the fourth-order sub-watersheds. Bifurcation ratio (Rb) is strongly correlated with L1, L2, L3, L4, and drainage texture (Dt) in the fourth-order sub-watershed. These correlations insinuate a tectonic influence in the basin and show an ultrafine drainage texture that ultimately forms badland topography. The relation between Dd-Lg-C-If-Rn produces a self-enhancing system of badland development, which promotes erosion in the area under study. These correlations provide a well-figured observation of the sub-watershed that, due to the increase in infiltration number (If), the drainage density (Dd) also increases, which leads to enhancement of channel cutting and erosion rates (low Lg and C value). This correlation coefficient of Rn is moderately low, indicating a single storey type of badlands. The badlands seem to have formed owing to setting up of self-enhancing erosive system on paleo wetlands, as evidenced by the presence of calcretes. Calcretes have been related to the presence of wetlands' conditions. These have been related to fall in water levels, therefore, indicating much higher water levels nearly close to ground surfaces before setting up badlands conditions. Thus, the badlands which have shallow calcretes horizons can be said to have been wetlands in the past.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of historical and future land use and climate change on the streamflow and sediment yield of a tropical mountainous river basin in South India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) and climate change on the streamflow and sediment yield were investigated for the Payaswani River Basin, Western Ghats, India. The LULC was determined using Landsat images, and climate data were procured from five general circulation models for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 (moderate emission) and 8.5 (high emission). The land change modeler was used to derive the future LULC and its changes from 1988 (historical) to 2030 (future) by using the transition matrix method. The SWAT model was used to assess the impacts of LULC and climate change for the streamflow and sediment yield. The results showed that decrease in forests and grasslands and increase in plantation, agricultural, and urban areas from 1988 to 2030 would lead to an increase in the mean streamflow (11.23%) and sediment yield (17.41%). Under RCP 4.5, climate change would decrease the streamflow by 2.38% in 2030. However, under RCP 8.5, climate change would increase the streamflow by 0.12% in 2030. The sediment yield under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 would increase by 1.23% and 3.33%, respectively. In comparison with the baseline condition, by 2030 future changes in the LULC and climate would increase the streamflow by 7.05% and 11.71% under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The sediment yield would increase by 7.92% and 27.11% under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The streamflow and sediment yield were predicted to increase in the summer and winter but decrease in the monsoon season.

TI  - The prognostic significance of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in cutaneous and acral melanoma patients-A multicenter retrospective study
T2  - CANCER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Whether non-sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma patients can benefit from completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is still unclear. The current study was performed to identify the prognostic role of non-SLN status in SLN-positive melanoma and to investigate the predictive factors of non-SLN metastasis in acral and cutaneous melanoma patients. Methods The records of 328 SLN-positive melanoma patients who underwent radical surgery at four cancer centers from September 2009 to August 2017 were reviewed. Clinicopathological data including age, gender, Clark level, Breslow index, ulceration, the number of positive SLNs, non-SLN status, and adjuvant therapy were included for survival analyses. Patients were followed up until death or June 30, 2019. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to identify factors associated with non-SLN positivity. Log-rank analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to identify the prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Among all enrolled patients, 220 (67.1%) had acral melanoma and 108 (32.9%) had cutaneous melanoma. The 5-year DFS and OS rate of the entire cohort was 31.5% and 54.1%, respectively. More than 1 positive SLNs were found in 123 (37.5%) patients. Positive non-SLNs were found in 99 (30.2%) patients. Patients with positive non-SLNs had significantly worse DFS and OS (log-rankP < 0.001). Non-SLN status (P = 0.003), number of positive SLNs (P = 0.016), and adjuvant therapy (P = 0.025) were independent prognostic factors for DFS, while non-SLN status (P = 0.002), the Breslow index (P = 0.027), Clark level (P = 0.006), ulceration (P = 0.004), number of positive SLNs (P = 0.001), and adjuvant therapy (P = 0.007) were independent prognostic factors for OS. The Breslow index (P = 0.020), Clark level (P = 0.012), and number of positive SLNs (P = 0.031) were independently related to positive non-SLNs and could be used to develop more personalized surgical strategy. Conclusions Non-SLN-positive melanoma patients had worse DFS and OS even after immediate CLND than those with non-SLN-negative melanoma. The Breslow index, Clark level, and number of positive SLNs were independent predictive factors for non-SLN status.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of air pollution over 41 cities of India during the COVID-19 lockdown period
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we characterize the impacts of COVID-19 on air pollution using NO2 and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from TROPOMI and MODIS satellite datasets for 41 cities in India. Specifically, our results suggested a 13% NO2 reduction during the lockdown (March 25-May 3rd, 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 1st-March 24th, 2020) period. Also, a 19% reduction in NO2 was observed during the 2020-lockdown as compared to the same period during 2019. The top cities where NO2 reduction occurred were New Delhi (61.74%), Delhi (60.37%), Bangalore (48.25%), Ahmedabad (46.20%), Nagpur (46.13%), Gandhinagar (45.64) and Mumbai (43.08%) with less reduction in coastal cities. The temporal analysis revealed a progressive decrease in NO2 for all seven cities during the 2020 lockdown period. Results also suggested spatial differences, i.e., as the distance from the city center increased, the NO2 levels decreased exponentially. In contrast, to the decreased NO2 observed for most of the cities, we observed an increase in NO2 for cities in Northeast India during the 2020 lockdown period and attribute it to vegetation fires. The NO2 temporal patterns matched the AOD signal; however, the correlations were poor. Overall, our results highlight COVID-19 impacts on NO2, and the results can inform pollution mitigation efforts across different cities of India.

TI  - Potential Link between Equol Pollution and Field-Observed Intersex in Wild So-iuy Mullets (<i>Mugil soiuy</i>)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gonadal intersex has been observed in wild fishes and is attributed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals but the specific causes remain controversial. Here, a forensic analysis utilizing field and laboratory studies was conducted to explore the causal agent(s). In a 2008-2009 survey of Liaodong Bay, China, 20.7-33.3% incidences of gonadal intersex were observed in male so-iuy mullets (Mugil soiuy), a wild sentinel fish species. Steroidal estrogen (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and ethinylestradiol) and phytoestrogen (equol) were detected in seawater where the fishes were collected with median concentrations of 0.42 ng/L (0.02-1.42 ng/L) E2 equivalent (EEQ-E2) and 22.81 ng/L (0.10-155.99 ng/L) equol. A probabilistic model was used to evaluate the ecological risk of these estrogenic chemicals based on their distribution in the field and dose-response relationship from the laboratory surrogate Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish. The probability of the incidences of gonadal intersex due to equol exposure was estimated to be 13.5 +/- 12.1%, which is considerably higher than that for EEQ-E2, (7.2 +/- 68.8) x 10(-4). The agonistic activity of equol to the estrogen receptor a of so-iuy mullets was 3.5-fold higher than that to the estrogen receptor alpha of Japanese medaka, indicating that equol shows a stronger potential for inducing intersex in so-iuy mullets than in medaka. These results demonstrate that equol, rather than steroid estrogens, is a more likely causal agent for the field-observed intersex in male wild so-iuy mullets.

TI  - Suicidality Protective Factors Among Black College Students: Which Cultural and Personal Resources Matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTICULTURAL COUNSELING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This study examined the influence of cultural resources (ethnic identity, Afrocentric worldview, and religiosity) on suicidal thoughts and behaviors among Black college students and the role of personal resources (ego resiliency and optimism) as mediators of this link. Data collected from 257 participants were analyzed. A bivariate correlational analysis showed that ethnic identity was significantly associated with lower levels of suicidality. In addition, ego resiliency mediated the relationships between Afrocentric worldview, ethnic identity, and religiosity and suicidality. Este estudio examino la influencia que tienen los recursos culturales (identidad etnica, vision del mundo afrocentrica y religiosidad) sobre los pensamientos y comportamientos suicidas entre estudiantes universitarios negros, asi como el papel de los recursos personales (resiliencia del ego y optimismo) como mediadores de esta conexion. Se analizaron los resultados recogidos de 257 participantes. Un analisis correlacional bivariado mostro que la identidad etnica estaba asociada significativamente a niveles mas bajos de tendencias suicidas. Ademas, la resiliencia del ego medio la relacion entre la vision del mundo afrocentrica, la identidad etnica y la religiosidad y las tendencias suicidas.

TI  - The spatio-temporal characteristics of aerosol optical thickness as well as the relationship with PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Xiamen city, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term aerosol optical thickness (AOT) composited data (2002-2017) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft was used to evaluate the temporal and spatial variability of aerosol in Xiamen city by using wavelet analysis, and the relationship between the surface mass concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and the AOT was analyzed by using linear regression. The results showed that AOT increased gradually from 2002 to 2011, and then decreased. AOT displayed a significant 9-month periodicity in AOT was inferred wavelet analysis. AOT also showed significant annual variability in response to changes in weather and aerosol pollution. We observed highest AOT values in April, with a monthly mean of 1.00 +/- 0.18. Lowest values were observed in December, with a mean AOT of 0.52 +/- 0.11. Multi-year monthly AOT fluctuations were lowest in January with a low variation coefficient (0.14), and the largest fluctuations appeared in July with a high variation coefficient (0.29). Higher AOT values (similar to 1.1) were predominantly located in the southern urban areas of Xiamen and lower AOT values (similar to 0.3) were mainly located in northern rural regions. The aerosol pollution was serious in April with the smallest spatial variation coefficient of 0.25, and the highest spatial variation coefficient appeared in July. Highest intraannual variability predominantly occurred in the high-value areas in the center of Xiamen. AOT values remained high in Xiamen Island throughout the year with a multi-year mean of 0.87. There was a moderate correlation between ground-based PM2.5 and MODIS AOT. Therefore, we confirm the suitability of MODIS AOT to accurately estimate PM2.5 concentration and evaluate the temporal and spatial characteristics of air quality in Xiamen.

TI  - Inferring the potential impact of human activities on evapotranspiration in the Tumen River Basin based on LANDSAT imagery and historical statistics
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal changes in actual evapotranspiration (ETa) caused by different human activities is important for water management in water-sensitive areas, because ET(a)plays a major role in regulating the availability of water on land. Thus, ET(a)observation is particularly important for observing land degradation in the watershed. This study used the operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) model to perform ET(a)estimations and observations in the Tumen River Basin (TRB), covering the border of China and Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), over the last 30 years by using eight periods of clear-sky LANDSAT Thematic Mapper/Operational Land Imager (TM/OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. To assess the reliability of the ET(a)estimations, multilayer soil temperatures from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) Land Data Assimilation System Version 2.0 (CLDAS-V2.0) were utilized. The highestR(2)(.71) between ET(a)and soil temperature was observed in layers shallower than 10 cm; this value ofR(2)gradually decreased to .57 at a depth of 200 cm. The average ET(a)of the TRB declined from 1.65 mm in 1985 to 1.03 mm in 2017. The impact of human activities on water loss (ETa) was determined by comparing land cover changes observed by an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach and economic activities between 1994 and 2008. Varying economic activities and water depletion in different soil layers may have led to the variable ET(a)values between the northern (China) and southern (DPRK) part of the TRB during the last three decades.

TI  - Comparison of Machine-Learning Algorithms for Near-Surface Air-Temperature Estimation from FY-4A AGRI Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Six machine-learning approaches, including multivariate linear regression (MLR), gradient boosting decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and deep neural network (DNN), were compared for near-surface air-temperature (T-air) estimation from the new generation of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) observations. The brightness temperatures in split-window channels from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) of FY-4A and numerical weather prediction data from the global forecast system were used as the predictor variables for T-air estimation. The performance of each model and the temporal and spatial distribution of the estimated T-air errors were analyzed. The results showed that the XGB model had better overall performance, with R-2 of 0.902, bias of -0.087 degrees C, and root-mean-square error of 1.946 degrees C. The spatial variation characteristics of the T-air error of the XGB method were less obvious than those of the other methods. The XGB model can provide more stable and high-precision T-air for a large-scale T-air estimation over China and can serve as a reference for T-air estimation based on machine-learning models.

TI  - A multi-granularity knowledge association model of geological text based on hypernetwork
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the explosive growth of geological data, considerable researches are focused on accurately retrieving specific information from massive data and fully exploiting the potential knowledge and information in unstructured data. Currently, the researches on unstructured content retrieval mostly ignore the association of semantics and knowledge or only consider the association of a singular granularity, which leads to the lost of concepts with the same semantics but expressed in different forms during the retrieval process. To address these problems, this paper has made some enhancements, and the main contributions include: (1) Define a decision rule, split unstructured geological survey data into content fragments, and construct a more fine-grained geologic textual semantic description model. (2) Present a multi-constraint fusion feature weighted model to extract the thematic feature items from the content fragments. (3) From the three granularity of document, content-item, feature-item, the associations of the same-granularity and cross-granularity are merged to construct a multi-granularity geological text hypernetwork model. (4) The experiments verify that the proposed approaches can improve the precision and recall rate of unstructured content retrieval.

TI  - Geospatial Analyses for Assessing the Driving Forces of Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics Around the Nile Delta Branches, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Major driving forces can alter Land use/Land cover (LULC) dynamics and affect landscape sustainability around the Nile Delta of Egypt. The present study aims at evaluating and mapping changes in LULC and assessing the dynamics of LULC and Land Surface Temperature (LST) around the two branches of the Nile Delta, Egypt using Landsat data and GIS. Calibrated Landsat images were acquired on 2000, 2014 and 2019 and processed to produce LULC, environmental indices and LST, respectively, using ENVI 5.3. ArcGIS 10.1 was used to extract a transition map from 2000 to 2019 around the two branches. The results displayed that five classes of LULC were extracted around Damietta and Rosetta branches; water, urban, bare, dense and spare vegetation. A continuous increase in water was recorded around Damietta branch; 13.66 km(2)(197%), 14.21 km(2)(2.04%) and 16.54 km(2)(2.30%) in 2000, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Also, urban area was increased around Damietta and Rosetta branch as follows: 53.6 km(2)(7.72%), 58.34 (8.37%) and 90.37 km(2)(13.70%) in 2000, 2014 and 2019, 59.55 km(2)(6.809%), 104.16 (11.90%) and 149.77 km(2)(17.11%) in 2000, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Urban achieved the highest gain of 24.807 and 85.70 km(2)at the expense of dense vegetation around Damietta and Rosetta branch, respectively. The results showed that the decrease in vegetation and the increase in urban density lead to increasing LST of the study area. The changes in LST can be monitored depending on the construction materials such as the presence of green areas and topography. Urban and bare lands have the highest LST while the water bodies and vegetation temperature showed a tendency to decrease. It can be concluded that urban areas increased with annual rate 0.27 and 0.54 km(2)and vegetation decreased with annual rate -0.57 and-0.55 km(2)around Damietta and Rosetta branches from 2000 to 2019. Results showed that comprehensive index was 321.14 and 330.03 around Damietta and Rosetta branch, the higher the degree of development and exploitation. There has been a significant land use change which was due to an increase in population. Overall, this research provides valuable data about changes in LU/LC around the Nile Delta branches, it is very important for decision maker and stockholders for proper management.

TI  - Monitoring tropical forest succession at landscape scales despite uncertainty in Landsat time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting rates of forest succession at landscape scales will aid global efforts to restore tree cover to millions of hectares of degraded land. While optical satellite remote sensing can detect regional land cover change, quantifying forest structural change is challenging. We developed a state-space modeling framework that applies Landsat satellite data to estimate variability in rates of natural regeneration between sites in a tropical landscape. Our models work by disentangling measurement error in Landsat-derived spectral reflectance from process error related to successional variability. We applied our modeling framework to rank rates of forest succession between 10 naturally regenerating sites in Southwestern Panama from about 2001 to 2015 and tested how different models for measurement error impacted forecast accuracy, ecological inference, and rankings of successional rates between sites. We achieved the greatest increase in forecasting accuracy by adding intra-annual phenological variation to a model based on Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The best-performing model accounted for inter- and intra-annual noise in spectral reflectance and translated NDVI to canopy height via Landsat-lidar fusion. Modeling forest succession as a function of canopy height rather than NDVI also resulted in more realistic estimates of forest state during early succession, including greater confidence in rank order of successional rates between sites. These results establish the viability of state-space models to quantify ecological dynamics from time series of space-borne imagery. State-space models also provide a statistical approach well-suited to fusing high-resolution data, such as airborne lidar, with lower-resolution data that provides better temporal and spatial coverage, such as the Landsat satellite record. Monitoring forest succession using satellite imagery could play a key role in achieving global restoration targets, including identifying sites that will regain tree cover with minimal intervention.

TI  - Spatial epidemiology of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> seroprevalence in sentinel feral chickens (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) in Kaua'i, Hawai'i
T2  - PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasma gondiiis a globally prevalent coccidian parasite that fatally infects a wide range of endangered avian and mammalian hosts in Hawai'i including the Hawaiian Monk Seal (llio holo I ka uaua;Monachus schauinslandi), Hawaiian Goose (Nene;Branta sandvicensis) and Hawaiian Crow ('Alala;Corvus hawaiiensis). Thus, identifying environmental factors that predict or impactT. gondiiexposure is important for mitigating disease risks. The island of Kaua'i is a good model system to study spatial and environmental covariates ofT. gondiiprevalence due to (1) high landscape heterogeneity spanning a small geographical area, (2) the presence of an ideal sentinel species, the feral chicken (Gallus gallus), and (3) recent evidence thatT. gondiicontributes to local declines of Hawai'i's endemic bird and mammal species. Despite these compelling opportunities, little is known about the prevalence or distribution ofT. gondiiin Hawai'i. In this study, 294 Kaua'i feral chickens were tested forT. gondiiusing ELISA IgG immunoassays, of which 117 chickens (39.8%) tested seropositive - indicating infection with the parasite - and nearly every sampled site contained chickens with positive seroprevalence. Prevalence varied among the 34 sampled localities and was significantly, positively correlated with proximity to the coast. These findings reveal thatT. gondiiis prevalent across Kaua'i. Furthermore, this variability offers insight to the factors that might predictT. gondiiseropositivity across the landscape, and likewise predict exposure risks for endangered wildlife.

TI  - The enterococcal PASTA kinase: A sentinel for cell envelope stress
T2  - MOLECULAR ORAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Enterococci are Gram-positive, opportunistic pathogens that reside throughout the gastrointestinal tracts of most terrestrial organisms. Enterococci are resistant to many antibiotics, which makes enterococcal infections difficult to treat. Enterococci are also particularly hardy bacteria that can tolerate a variety of environmental stressors. Understanding how enterococci sense and respond to the extracellular environment to enact adaptive biological responses may identify new targets that can be exploited for development of treatments for enterococcal infections. Bacterial eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases (eSTKs) and cognate phosphatases (STPs) are important signaling systems that mediate biological responses to extracellular stimuli. Some bacterial eSTKs are transmembrane proteins that contain a series of extracellular repeats of thepenicillin-bindingandSer/Thr kinase-associated (PASTA) domain, leading to their designation as "PASTA kinases." Enterococcal genomes encode a single PASTA kinase and its cognate phosphatase. Investigations of the enterococcal PASTA kinase revealed its importance in resistance to antibiotics and other cell wall stresses, in enterococcal colonization of the mammalian gut, clues about its mechanism of signal transduction, and its integration with other enterococcal signal transduction systems. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge of PASTA kinase signaling in enterococci and describe important gaps that still need to be addressed to provide a better understanding of this important signaling system.

TI  - Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use among pregnant and reproductive-age women in the United States
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To assess the prevalence and potential indications of PDE5 inhibitor use among pregnant and reproductive-age women in the United States. Methods We identified women 15 to 50 years with a livebirth from January 2001 through March 2018 in Sentinel Database. We assessed the prevalence of PDE5 inhibitor use prior to and during pregnancy by trimester, identified potential on- and off-label indications using predefined diagnosis codes recorded within 90 days before the estimated last menstrual period through delivery. Separately, we used data from IQVIA's National Prescription Audit and Total Patient Tracker to estimate the dispensed prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors and the number of patients with PDE5 inhibitor prescriptions. Results We identified approximately 3.3 million pregnancies during 2001 to 2018, 96 of which had PDE5 inhibitor use during pregnancy. Prevalence of PDE5 inhibitor use was 2.61, 0.62, and 0.62 per 100, 000 live-born pregnancies during the first, second, or third trimesters, respectively. Among women exposed to a PDE5 inhibitor from 90 days before conception to the end of pregnancy, 25.0%, 31.1%, and 15.5% had a diagnosis code for fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In IQVIA data, an estimated 223, 000 prescriptions from July 2015 through June 2018 and 58, 000 women received prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors in 2017, of whom approximately 15, 000 (26%) were aged 15 to 50 years. Conclusion We found a low prevalence of PDE5 inhibitor use in pregnant and reproductive-age women. Given the very low prevalence of use and the inconsistency of neonatal mortality data across STRIDER centers, the risk to public health is low at present.

TI  - Dust dominates high-altitude snow darkening and melt over high-mountain Asia
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Westerly driven, long-range transportation of dust particles in elevated aerosol layers (EALs) is a persistent phenomenon during spring and summer over the Indian subcontinent. During the snow accumulation season, EALs transport substantial amounts of dust to the snow-covered slopes of high-mountain Asia (HMA). Here we use multiple satellite-based estimates to demonstrate a robust physical association between the EALs and dust-induced snow darkening over HMA. Results from a fully coupled atmosphere-chemistry-snow model support these observations, revealing across HMA a signature of increasing dust-induced snow darkening with surface elevation that peaks near 4,500 m. Moreover, the influence of dust on snow darkening is greater than that of black carbon above 4,000 m. Our findings suggest a discernible role of dust in the observed spatial heterogeneity of snowmelt and snowline trends over HMA and highlight an increasing contribution of dust to snowmelt as the snowline rises with warming.

TI  - A Post-Anthropocentric Explication of the Posthuman World-Building in Adrian Tchaikovsky's<i>the Doors of Eden</i>
T2  - CRITIQUE-STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study seeks to analyze Adrian Tchaikovsky's novelThe Doors of Eden(2020) to describe how posthumanism and post-anthropocentrism can go hand-in-hand in contemporary speculative fiction. The novel itself is a masterpiece in world-building where the action takes place against the background of an eternally proliferating multiversal reality. Parallel worlds, sentient monsters, posthuman, non-human entities abound in the novel, and this will be seen as complementary and conducive to the posthuman universe-building in the narrative. Through the analysis of the novelThe Doors of Eden, I have attempted to show how posthumanism can effectively dismantle and destroy a human-centered worldview by incorporating tropes of monstrosity, alienness, immersive virtual reality, mind-uploading, and integration of mind and machine - all of which eventually come together to define and reinforce the post-anthropomorphic paradigm. For the purpose of the explication, the author has adopted various theoretical insights from the renowned contemporary theoreticians among which Rosi Braidotti's criticalposthumanism, Barad's intra-action and agential realism, and Bruno Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and, Lenton & Latour's Gaia 2.0 hypothesis will be important.

TI  - Assessment of human-induced environmental disaster in the Aral Sea using Landsat satellite images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea was the fourth largest lake in the world before 1960. Reduction of water resources and the growth of water intake and reservoirs in the source rivers have severely desiccated the Aral Sea. This study aimed to model the spatiotemporal and surface temperature changes of the Aral Sea in the period 1986-2017 using the Landsat multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques. Since the desiccation period was accompanied by climate change, hydrological data of source rivers, as well as climate data were collected from meteorological stations near the Aral Sea, to study the causes of changes. To achieve the research objectives, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was selected among the other indices to extract and quantify the water area changes. Land and water surface temperature values were calculated using the thermal bands to examine the surface temperature change, which has rarely been discussed in the literature. The results revealed a significant decrease in the Aral Sea surface area (similar to 78%) and a considerable increase in the land surface summertime temperature (similar to 12 degrees C). The statistical results showed that the Aral Sea water extent decreased from 44,164 km(2) in 1986 to 9772 km(2) in 2017.

TI  - Upper and lower treeline biogeographic patterns in semi-arid pinyon-juniper woodlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Upper and lower treelines are particularly exposed to a changing climate. It has been hypothesized that upper treelines are constrained by growing season temperature, whereas lower tree lines are water limited. We expect different causal mechanisms of upper versus lower tree line formation to generate distinct patterns of spatial heterogeneity. Here, we compare dynamics, spatial patterns and shape complexity of upper and lower tree lines of semi-arid pinyon-juniper woodlands. Location Toiyabe Range of the Nevada Great Basin (western US). Taxon Pinus monophyllaTorr. & Frem. andJuniperus osteosperma(Torr.) Methods Within 20 sample plots (10 along the upper and 10 along the lower tree line), we mapped tree canopies through photointerpretation of high-resolution imagery. We performed point pattern analyses to compare the spatial arrangement of trees and used LANDSAT 30-year time series and NDVI to understand the vegetation dynamics of these ecotones. We adopted the surface roughness method to measure tree line shape complexity. Results Lower tree lines were denser and showed a stronger trend of increasing NDVI change over the 1984-2015 period. Trees at the lower tree line were more strongly aggregated than at the upper tree line at spatial scales ranging from 15 to 65 meters. Shape complexity was higher at upper tree lines, expressed by a higher mean surface roughness; however, the spatial structures of upper and lower tree lines were similar. Main conclusions Upper tree line expansion of pinyon-juniper woodlands in the study area has been limited and highly variable, but lower tree line downslope expansion into adjacent shrub steppe vegetation was evident. The expected difference between energy- and water-limited tree lines did not manifest in the observed spatial structures. Differences in tree line shape complexity were not significant, although lower tree lines exhibited less complex shapes, likely because they have been more strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors.

TI  - Ambient air particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) satellite monitoring and respiratory health effects assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Air particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) is one of the main causes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). This study explored the relationship between PM(10)by remote sensing and AECOPD in Chaharmahal-o-Bakhtiari province from 2014 to2018. Method PM(10)concentrations were predicted and validated based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) from 161 images processed by MODIS sensor and ground air quality monitoring station data. Demographic information and spirometric indices of 2038 patients with AECOPD were collected and analyzed from the hospital during the studied periods. SPSS software was used to analyze the relationships between these two categories of information. Results There was a significant negative relationship between PM10 and FVC, FVC%, FEV1, FEV1%, FEF25-75, FEV1/FVC, PEF, and FEF25FVC indices (p < 0.05). The results showed that over 2014-2018, the annual mean of PM10 concentrations varied from 35 to 52 mu g/m3. The result of the regression model showed that the patient's age, body mass index (BMI), and PM(10)concentrations were the most affecting variables on the two important spirometric indices i.e., FVC% and FEV1%. The PM(10)concentrations and number of AECOPD patients had a similar pattern during the studied period. The women group, age group above 74 years, normal BMI, and non-smoking patients showed the most sensitivity to the PM(10)concentrations. Conclusions Our findings provide supplementary scientific information on PM(10)concentration related to the incidence of AECOPD and as a variable affecting the most important spirometry indicators by providing local decision-makers information needed to set a priority of air pollution control measures as well as health services.

TI  - Assessment of impacts of land use/land cover changes upstream of a dam in a semi-arid watershed using QSWAT
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of hydrodynamic responses of the watershed influenced by the changes occurring in the climate and pattern of land use is vital in the management of sustainable water resources. The open-source soil and water assessment tool QSWAT has been adopted in this study to link the meteorological factors with land-surface hydrology and present a complete response of an ungauged watershed in the Krishna basin. The main objective of the present work is to assess the adaptability of the QSWAT model for the selected semi-arid watershed, which has undergone drastic land use/land cover (LULC) changes due to the construction of a dam. The impact of the LULC changes on the hydrodynamic response of the watershed is analysed. For automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis, SUFI-2 algorithm is used. Initially, the model adaptability for the watershed is assessed by simulating for 32 years, of which 27 years (from 1982 to 2008) are used for calibration and 5 years (from 2008 to 2013) for validation. Further, Landsat satellite images along with 14 LULC classifications for the year 1998 and 2009, indicating scenarios of pre- and post-construction of the dam, respectively, are used as input to QSWAT to analyse the influence of LULC changes on the water balance components. The comparison indicates decrease in the agricultural area, barren land and urban built-up area. The annual water yield and surface runoff of the watershed have been reduced by 28.97% and 29.91%, respectively. An increment of 6% evapotranspiration loss with a decreasing trend in rainfall is noted which is alarming. The simulated results indicate that the hydrological responses are influenced by the LULC changes. The basin LULC and hydrological components have been affected by the storage reservoir created due to the dam. The QSWAT seems to be reliable tool as there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed flows. The obtained model performance indices: the NSE andR(2)calibration values are 0.89 and 0.96, respectively, and the values for validation are 0.79 and 0.83 respectively, hence indicating a strong and predictive capability of the model to the ungauged watersheds with drastic LULC changes. Apart from establishing sustainable water resources management techniques in the watershed, there is a stressing need for such analysis before any human intervention into the natural system like construction of dams.

A1  - Childhood Liver Dis Res Network
TI  - Modeling Outcomes in Children With Biliary Atresia With Native Liver After 2 Years of Age
T2  - HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 50% of infants with biliary atresia (BA) undergoing Kasai portoenterostomy show survival with native liver (SNL) at age 2 years. Predictors of disease progression after age 2 years are unknown, despite estimates of 20%-30% undergoing liver transplant (LT) between age 2 and 18 years. We sought to address this knowledge gap by developing prognostic models in participants of the multicenter prospective National Institutes of Health-supported Childhood Liver Disease Research Network. We extracted 14 clinical and biochemical variables at age 2 years to develop two models for future outcomes: 1) LT or death (LTD) and 2) first sentinel event (SE), either new onset ascites, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), or gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. A total of 240 participants, enrolled between 2004 and 2017, were followed until a median age of 5.1 years (range, 2.0-13.3 years). Of these participants, 38 underwent LT (n = 37) or death (n = 1); cumulative incidence, 23.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.2%-32.0%). Twenty-seven experienced either new-onset ascites (n = 13), HPS (n = 1), or GI bleed (n = 14). One participant had ascites and GI bleed concurrently; cumulative incidence, 21.5% (95% CI, 14.2%-29.8%) by age 10 years. The Cox proportional hazard model predicted risk of LTD, using total bilirubin, albumin, platelet count, and history of either ascites or cholangitis (BA LTD model), with a C-index of 0.88 (range, 0.86-0.89). A cause-specific hazard competing risk model predicted SE using platelet count and gamma glutamyltransferase levels (BA SE model) with a C-index of 0.81 (range, 0.80-0.84). Internal model validity was assessed using Harrell's C-index with cross-validation.Conclusion:Stratification using these models identified risk of poor outcomes in patients with BA SNL after age 2 years. The models may identify those who would benefit from enhanced clinical surveillance and prioritization in clinical trials.

TI  - Relationship between MODIS EVI and LAI across time and space
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is used as input in hydrological and bio-chemical models for the estimation of water-cycle characteristics, agricultural primary production and other processes. Vegetation Indices (VIs) are used to monitor vegetation state and health. Considering that easily computed VIs can be used for the estimation of LAI, this study applied a regression analysis between MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and LAI data in five sites around the world. A linear model was found to provide a good description of the LAI-EVI relationship across all examined vegetation types and times. Medium accuracy models were improved when variability of time and vegetation type were considered, indicating that these parameters highly affect the LAI-EVI relationship. Sensitivity of EVI to LAI was higher in periods of high biomass production. Regression analysis between LAI-EVI showed a stronger relationship for the study sites characterized by dry and warm tropical climatic conditions.

TI  - OPTimizing Irradiation through Molecular Assessment of Lymph node (OPTIMAL): a randomized open label trial
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Conservative surgery followed by breast and nodal irradiation is the standard loco-regional early breast cancer (BC) treatment for patients with four or more involved lymph nodes. However, the treatment strategy when fewer nodes are involved remains unclear, especially when lymphadenectomy has not been performed. Sensitive nodal status assessment molecular techniques as the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) assay can contribute to the definition and standardization of the treatment strategy. Therefore, the OPTIMAL study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of incidental irradiation of axillary nodes in patients with early-stage BC and limited involvement of the SLN.Methods: BC patients who underwent conservative surgery and whose SLN total tumour load assessed with OSNA ranged between 250-15,000 copies/pL will be eligible. Patients will be randomized to receive irradiation on the breast, tumour bed, axillary and supraclavicular lymph node areas (intentional arm) or only on the breast and tumour bed (incidental arm). All areas, including the internal mammary chain, will be contoured. The mean, median, D5% and D95% doses received in all volumes will be calculated. The primary endpoint is the non-inferiority of the incidental irradiation of axillary nodes compared to the intentional irradiation in terms of 5-year disease free survival. Secondary endpoints comprise the comparison of acute and chronic toxicity and loco-regional and distant disease recurrence rates.Discussion: Standardizing the treatment and diagnosis of BC patients with few nodes affected is crucial due to the lack of consensus. Hence, the quantitative score for the metastatic burden of SLN provided by OSNA can contribute by improving the discrimination of which BC patients with limited nodal involvement can benefit from incidental radiation as an adjuvant treatment strategy.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Technique Using Dual Tracer Technique in Post Lumpectomy Early Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the gold standard for the evaluation of axilla in clinically node-negative early breast cancers. There is limited data on the role and efficacy of the same in the post lumpectomy scenario. This prospective interventional study was conducted over 1 year on 30 post lumpectomy pT1/2 cN0 patients. SLNB was performed by preoperative lymphoscintigram using technetium-labeled human serum albumin followed by intraoperative blue dye injection. Sentinel nodes were identified based on blue dye uptake and gamma probe and sent for intra operative frozen section. Completion axillary nodal dissection was performed in all cases. The primary end point was sentinel node identification rate and accuracy of nodal frozen section. Sentinel node identification rate was 86.7% (n = 26/30) for scintigraphy alone and 96.7% (n = 29/30) using combined method. Average sentinel nodal yield/patient was 3.6 (range 0-7). Maximum yield was seen for hot and blue nodes (1.86). Sensitivity (n = 9/9) and specificity (n = 19/19) of frozen section were 100% with a false negative rate of 0% (0/19). Demographic factors such as age, body mass index, laterality, quadrant, biology, grade, and pathological T stage had no impact on the identification rate. Sentinel lymph node using dual tracer has a high identification rate and a low false negative rate post lumpectomy. Age, body mass index, laterality, quadrant, grade, biology, and pathological T size had no impact on the identification rate.

TI  - Copernicus Sentinel imagery for more risk-resilient historic cities in coastal zones: contribution to the monitoring of Albenga archaeological site and delta of river Centa
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) technologies and products are traditionally providing an extremely important contribution to a more efficient management of built areas and people during emergencies. Their employment could be extremely useful in monitoring and risk assessment of protected monument and sites situated in potentially vulnerable areas such as costal zones. Change detection has a crucial role in such activities, especially in case of hazardous events-on one side, this method can provide inputs in the phases of risk assessment and rapid mapping for immediate response; on the other side, over prolonged periods of time after the event, change detection can be used for purposes of option analysis of technical solutions and for overall recovery planning of the site. Workflow proposed is based on the use of Copernicus Sentinel-2 data to provide the comparison of changes occurring during extreme flooding events of river Centa, Liguria. Firstly, an investigation of NDVI and NDWI of the extreme flooding event occurring in November 2019 was conducted. The event was then put in correlation with another previously studied flooding hazard occurring in 2016 in the same area that has caused severe damages to the archaeological remains of the medieval church of San Clemente, situated within the Centa riverbed. In conclusion, the results from both years have been compared with ground truth data of topographic database in order to observe the extension of the flooded area and to provide contribution to the monitoring activities. The aim of the research was to offer some novel insight for a more informed decision-making during the risk assessment, risk management and resilience phases regarding the vulnerable built heritage sites found in coastal areas.

TI  - Validation of TROPOMI tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> columns using dual-scan multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in Uccle, Brussels
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements of aerosols and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were carried out in Uccle (50.8 degrees N, 4.35 degrees E), Brussels, during 1 year from March 2018 until March 2019. The instrument was operated in both the UV and visible wavelength ranges in a dual-scan configuration consisting of two sub-modes: (1) an elevation scan in a fixed viewing azimuthal direction (the so-called main azimuthal direction) pointing to the northeast and (2) an azimuthal scan in a fixed low elevation angle (2 degrees). By applying a vertical profile inversion algorithm in the main azimuthal direction and a parameterization technique in the other azimuthal directions, near-surface NO2 volume mixing ratios (VMRs) and vertical column densities (VCDs) were retrieved in 10 different azimuthal directions. The dual-scan MAX-DOAS dataset allows for partly resolving the horizontal distribution of NO2 around the measurement site and studying its seasonal variations. Furthermore, we show that measuring the tropospheric NO2 VCDs in different azimuthal directions improves the spatial colocation with measurements from the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P), leading to a reduction of the spread in validation results. By using NO2 vertical profile information derived from the MAX-DOAS measurements, we also resolve a systematic underestimation in S5P NO2 data due to the use of inadequate a priori NO2 profile shape data in the satellite retrieval.

TI  - Spindle cell melanoma coexisting with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma: a rare collision tumor in multiple sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A strong association has been reported between chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and malignant melanoma (MM). In rare cases of MM, lymphoid malignancies may be detected incidentally during sentinel lymph node biopsies. In this case, we found a unique collision of MM and CLL infiltration in the skin. An 88-year-old male patient presented with a mass on the nasal root. Histopathological examination of the skin biopsy specimen revealed a deeply infiltrative, atypical spindle cell proliferation in the background of a collagenous stroma. Accompanying this lesion, there were foci of monotonous lymphoid cell populations involving skin appendages. In the immunohistochemical studies, the spindle cells were diffusely positive for S100, and focally positive for Melan-A and HMB45; the lymphoid cells were positive for CD20, CD5, and Bcl-2 and negative for CD3, Bcl-6, CD10, and Cyclin D1. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with diagnoses of spindle cell melanoma and CLL. Interestingly, these two tumors together in their same morphological appearance were confirmed in a subsequent liver biopsy. Active skin surveillance of patients with CLL may be important to detect MM at an early stage that correlates with a better prognosis.

TI  - Using pre-failure and post-failure remote sensing data to constrain the three-dimensional numerical model of a large rock slope failure
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Factors governing rock slope stability include lithology, geological structures, hydrogeological conditions, and landform evolution. When certain conditions are met, rock slopes may become unstable, inducing deformation and failure. In the present study, an integrated remote sensing-numerical modeling approach investigates the deformation mechanisms leading to the 1965 Hope Slide, BC, Canada and the effect of slope kinematics on the long-term evolution of the slope. Pre- and post-failure datasets were used to perform a large-scale geomorphic and structural characterization, including kinematic and block-theory analyses. Extensive data collection was also undertaken using state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques, including digital photogrammetry (Structure-from-Motion), laser scanning (aerial and terrestrial), and infrared thermography. New evidence is provided that one or more prehistoric failures caused the removal of a key-block, and the initiation of long-term slope deformation and cumulative slope damage ultimately resulting in the catastrophic 1965 event. Detailed characterization of the rock slope has allowed the first three-dimensional, distinct element numerical model of the Hope Slide to be conducted. The results of the numerical simulations involving gradual reduction of the rupture surface shear strength indicate that 1965 slope failure may represent the outcome of a long-term, progressive failure mechanism that initiated after a prehistoric landslide. This combined field mapping-remote sensing-numerical modeling study clearly highlights the role of 3D slope kinematics on the geomorphic evolution of the slope, along with the associated failure mechanisms.

TI  - Open data for algorithms: mapping poverty in Belize using open satellite derived features and machine learning
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of poverty and incomes within a country remains a challenge. Recently, several proposed methods incorporate features from satellite imagery to improve model performance (Babenko et al.,2017, Poverty mapping using convolutional neural networks trained on high and medium resolution satellite images, with an application in Mexico. ArXiv Preprint ArXiv:1711.06323) or supplant small area estimation methods (Jean et al.,2016, Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty. Science, 353(6301), 790-94. doi:10.1126/science.aaf7894; Engstrom et al.,2017, Poverty from space: Using high-resolution satellite imagery for estimating economic well-being.). However, these methods require high-spatial resolution imagery which, given their cost and infrequent acquisition, may render these advances impractical for most applications. We investigate how small area estimates of average income may improve when incorporating features derived from Sentinel-2 and MODIS imagery. Both satellites provide free imagery, have global coverage, and a frequent revisit rate. We estimate a poverty map for Belize which incorporates spatial and time series features derived from these sensors, with and without survey derived variables. We document an 8% percent improvement in model performance when including these satellite features. We conclude by arguing that Open Data for Development should include open data pipelines where possible.

TI  - Validation of sentinel-2 leaf area index (LAI) product derived from SNAP toolbox and its comparison with global LAI products in an African semi-arid agricultural landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study validated SNAP-derived LAI from Sentinel-2 and its consistency with existing global LAI products. The validation and inter-comparison experiments were performed on two processing levels, i. e., Top-of-Atmosphere and Bottom-of-Atmosphere reflectances and two spatial resolutions, i.e., 10 m, and 20 m. These were chosen to determine their effect on retrieved LAI accuracy and consistency. The results showed moderate R-2, i.e., similar to 0.6 to similar to 0.7 between SNAP-derived LAI and in-situ LAI, but with high errors, i.e., RMSE, BIAS, and MAE >2 m(2) m(-2) with marked differences between processing levels and insignificant differences between spatial resolutions. In contrast, inter-comparison of SNAP-derived LAI with MODIS and Proba-V LAI products revealed moderate to high consistencies, i. e., R-2 of similar to 0.55 and similar to 0.8 respectively, and RMSE of similar to 0.5 m(2) m(-2) and similar to 0.6 m(2) m(-2), respectively. The results in this study have implications for future use of SNAP-derived LAI from Sentinel-2 in agricultural landscapes, suggesting its global applicability that is essential for large-scale agricultural monitoring. However, enormous errors in characterizing field-level LAI variability indicate that SNAP-derived LAI is not suitable for precision farming. In fact, from the study, the need for further improvement of LAI retrieval arises, especially to support farm-level agricultural management decisions.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluate horizontal and vertical accuracy of seven open-source digital elevation models (DEMs) having moderate-to-high resolutions viz. 30 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM1), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global DEM (ASTER GDEM), Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D (AW3D30), and Cartosat DEM (CartoDEM), 90 m TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X), 12.5 m terrain corrected Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and 8 m High Mountain Asia (HMA) over the rugged mountainous terrain of the Karakoram region. Horizontal accuracy (specified inxandy) assessed by referring photogrammetrically generated master DEM from Cartosat-1 revealed AW3D30 as the most consistent DEM with a slight shift of +2.80 m and -4.89 m inxandydirection, respectively. However, vertical accuracy analysis showed that both HMA and AW3D30 DEMs are quite close to each other with MAE of 3.01 m and 3.46 m, RMSE of 5.6 m and 7.5 m, and NMAD of 4.09 m and 5.5 m, respectively. We also examined the influence of slope on DEM errors and associated elevation-dependent bias over non-glaciated surface which can be valuable input for geodetic mass balance estimations.

TI  - Web and phone-based COVID-19 syndromic surveillance in Canada: A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSyndromic surveillance through web or phone-based polling has been used to track the course of infectious diseases worldwide. Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study using three distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups.ResultsWe found that over March- April 2020, 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom in the previous month. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous/First nations/Inuit/Metis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath.InterpretationThe low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.

TI  - A new approach for optimizing air pollutant emissions using Newtonian relaxation and the coupled WRF-CAMx model: a case study in Xuzhou city, China
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution remains a very serious problem in China. Simulating and forecasting the air quality have become important tools for analyzing the temporal and spatial variations in air pollution and diagnosing the sources and transport pathways of air pollutants. However, the forecasting accuracy is greatly influenced by the quality of air pollutant emission inventory data, which are difficult to obtain. In this study, we used Newtonian relaxation and the coupled WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting)-CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) model to improve the simulation accuracy to correct the inventory data. By utilizing the corrected inventory data, the correlation coefficients of the simulated PM(2.5)emissions in April 2016 and April 2017 are greatly improved (with correlation coefficientR= 0.619 vs. 0.409, respectively, and root mean square errors RMSE = 0.0364 vs. 0.0404 mg/m(3), respectively). The estimated emission flux in the inner domain of the model is 41106.43 Mg/month in April, which is much higher (by 9.77%) than the emission flux predicted by the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) (37446.85 Mg/month). This paper is of great significance for the study of air quality early warning forecast on the mesoscale scale.

TI  - Matting model guided variational pansharpening with fractional order gradient transferring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we proposed a matting model guided variational pansharpening method with fractional order gradient transferring constraint to fuse a low-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) and a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (Pan) image to an HR-MS image. Specifically for the proposed model, we not only used the commonly local spectral fidelity constraint for spectral information preserving, but also applied the famous matting model fusion method to further enforce a spatial-spectral fidelity constraint, and particularly proposed a fractional-order gradient transferring constraint to transfer the spatial information of Pan image to the desired HR-MS image. Then, we designed an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model efficiently. Finally, the experimental results showed the superiority of the proposed method to various methods subjectively and objectively.

T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article takes up Agozino's call for love. Yet this call is not a straightforward one. In response, I press for an appreciation of love which avoids collapsing love into 'protection', engaging instead with the Aboriginal World View described by Kombumerri and Wakka Wakka woman and scholar, Mary Graham, as a form of conduct, reflection and a practice in listening. Through two quite distinct stories offered by young people in their encounters with Australia's criminal justice system, I explore the ethics of listening and respectful relations in social and institutional settings. While the first story reveals the denial of colonial violence accompanying protectionist policies for the 'care' of Indigenous communities, the second story shows how such patterns of denial underpin western 'justice' systems, including for settler peoples. Responding to Agozino's call requires that we examine the ethical act of listening and reflect on the repercussions of the failure to listen.

TI  - Bio-optical evidence for increasing <i>Phaeocystis</i> dominance in the Barents Sea
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing contributions of prymnesiophytes such as Phaeocystis pouchetii and Emiliania huxleyi to Barents Sea (BS) phytoplankton production have been suggested based on in situ observations of phytoplankton community composition, but the scattered and discontinuous nature of these records confounds simple inference of community change or its relationship to salient environmental variables. However, provided that meaningful assessments of phytoplankton community composition can be inferred based on their optical characteristics, ocean-colour records offer a potential means to develop a synthesis between sporadic in situ observations. Existing remote-sensing algorithms to retrieve phytoplankton functional types based on chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration or indices of pigment packaging may, however, fail to distinguish Phaeocystis from other blooms of phytoplankton with high pigment packaging, such as diatoms. We develop a novel algorithm to distinguish major phytoplankton functional types in the BS and apply it to the MODIS-Aqua ocean-colour record, to study changes in the composition of BS phytoplankton blooms in July, between 2002 and 2018, creating time series of the spatial distribution and intensity of coccolithophore, diatom and Phaeocystis blooms. We confirm a north-eastward expansion in coccolithophore bloom distribution, identified in previous studies, and suggest an inferred increase in chl-a concentrations, reported by previous researchers, may be partly explained by increasing frequencies of Phaeocystis blooms. This article is part of the theme issue 'The changing Arctic Ocean: consequences for biological communities, biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning'.

TI  - Local community involvement in nature conservation under the auspices of Community-Based Natural Resource Management: A state of the art review
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Numerous initiatives and programmes were introduced to enable biodiversity conservation, and community involvement was among these propositions. In line with such initiatives, several frameworks were thus developed to ensure the sustainable implementation and realisation of such programmes. This saw the establishment of the Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM). As such, numerous calls were made to explore community involvement strategies and associated socio-economic impacts in nature conservation. Most studies and reports emanating from such calls demonstrate cases of failure ofinter aliaincluding poaching. This work, therefore, provides a detailed synthesis of the implications of involving local communities in conservation in protected areas (PAs) and further examines how spatial explicit methodologies can be adopted in enhancing nature conservation. Overall, the study has shown that community attitudes and perceptions towards nature conservation in PAs point towards the failure of the CBNRM approach. Weak, conflicted and sometimes corrupt governance and poor institutional arrangements seem to have contributed towards its failure. Overall, the review further indicates that most studies on community involvement in nature conservation have not fully considered the spatial dimension, and this has hampered holistic and effective monitoring and assessment of biodiversity in PAs to ensure sustainable management and the possible implications of such an approach towards conservation. This work, therefore, recommends a shift towards collaborative modelling, transdisciplinary monitoring and assessment approaches to improve biodiversity conservation as well as to determine the success and limitations of the CBNRM approach in Africa and the world over.

TI  - Integration of Thermal Infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar Images to Identify Geothermal Steam Spots Under Thick Vegetation Cover
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying physical properties of geothermal features such as surface temperature and roughness is crucial for geothermal assessment, hydrology, and environmental studies. Surface temperature and roughness-related rock properties strongly influence the thermal infrared and back-scattering intensities, respectively, of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This study aimed to identify geothermal steam spots based on the surface temperature and roughness of altered surfaces, mud pools, and hot springs in tropical conditions. The thermal emissivity separation method was adopted to calculate kinetic temperature using the thermal infrared (TIR) of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data as well as ground temperature data. Surface temperatures calculated by the thermal emissivity separation method were corrected using measured ground temperatures to eliminate the effects of atmospheric absorption, thermal inertia of materials, and/or diurnal temperature in the images. In addition, the linear fitting method was applied to obtain the final surface roughness model based on the calculated determination coefficient (R-2) between the initial surface roughness model derived by Sentinel-1A SAR and field data. The highestR(2)between surface roughness values from Sentinel-1A SAR and field data were selected to calculate spatially the surface roughness of the Wayang Windu Geothermal Field, West Java, Indonesia. The satellite imagery and field measurements showed that surface temperature and roughness features correlate with each other, and high and low thermal features correlate with high and low surface roughness values, respectively. Accordingly, we integrated the TIR and SAR data to propose the thermal resistivity index (TRI) as an indicator of the hydrothermal fluid paths to the surface. Low TRI was encountered at geothermal features and intersections of subsurface faults, which indicated weak zones that radiate heat from the subsurface to the surface.

TI  - Who Needs Level III Lymph Node Dissection in Carcinoma Breast-Study from a Tertiary Care Center
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Indian females, breast cancer is the most common cancer with a late stage of presentation leading to one-third of patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Our study is undertaken to find out predictors of level III axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer and who needs complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Retrospective study of 146 patients who undergone MRM or breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with complete ALND at Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology was done, and data was analyzed to find out the frequency of level III lymph nodes and the demographic relation and its relation to positive lymph nodes in level I + II. Positive metastatic level III lymph node was found in 6% of patients, with the median age of the patient in our study with level III positivity was 48.5 years with 63% pathological stage II with 88% perinodal spread (PNS)- and lymphovascular invasion (LVI)-positive. Involvement of level III lymph node was associated with gross disease in level I + II lymph node having more than four lymph node-positive and with pT3 stage or more which has higher chances of level III lymph node involvement. Level III lymph node involvement, though rare in early-stage breast cancer, is associated with larger clinical and pathological sizes (T3 or more), more than 4 lymph node-positive in level I + II and with PNS and LVI. Hence, based on these results, we recommend that for inpatient with more than 5-cm tumor size and those with the gross disease in axilla, complete ALND is recommended.

TI  - A test of a sun glint correction method for the near-3.9 μm channels of the FengYun-3D Hyperspectral InfraRed Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hyperspectral InfraRed Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS), the first Chinese sun-synchronous hyperspectral infrared sounder onboard FengYun 3D (FY-3D), was launched on 15 November 2017. It will play a significant role in improving forecast accuracy of numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, sun glint effects on the FY-3D HIRAS 3.9 mu m channels cannot be currently estimated by radiative transfer models. In this study, a new method for quantifying sun glint effects has been developed through a cubic fitting relationship between sun glint angles and the observed brightness temperature minus simulated brightness temperature (O - B) after bias correction. The results show that the brightness temperatures of channel 2275 (2550 cm(-1)) are higher over the ocean between 40 degrees S and 40 degrees N within areas of sun glint angle less than 40 degrees; in these regions,O - Bvalues can reach 10 K during the daytime. Daytime global mean clear-skyO - Bbiases from channel 2035 (2400 cm(-1)) to channel 2275 (2550 cm(-1)) increase gradually from 0 to 2.5 K. In contrast, daytimeO - Bbiases after sun glint correction are within +/- 0.2 K, indicating that the corrected radiances are suitable to be assimilated into NWP systems.

Animals Seventy dogs withEnterococcusspp. bacteriuria (case) and 70 dogs withEnterococcus colibacteriuria (control). Methods A single center retrospective case-control study with subjects and controls identified by a medical records search forEnterococcusspp. (subject) orE coli(control) bacteriuria from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. Cases and controls were balanced with respect to average age and weight. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate and test whether the odds of havingEnterococcusspp. bacteriuria (instead ofE coli) were associated with the presence of any given characteristic. Results A history of recurrent bacteriuria was significantly more common inEnterococcusspp. cases than inE colicontrols (odds ratio [OR]: 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-4.16,P= .04). Comorbidities associated with the presence ofEnterococcusspp. bacteriuria included lower urinary tract (LUT) anatomic abnormalities (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.17-8.10,P= .02), urolithiasis (P= .01), and the presence of LUT neoplasia (P= .04). Small frequencies (n = 12 and n = 6, respectively) compromise our ability to precisely estimate the genuine OR for the latter 2 characteristics. Conclusions and Clinical Importance If the identified risk factors promoteEnterococcusspp. colonization in dogs via induced LUT inflammation similar to people thenEnterococcusspp. bacteriuria could be a sentinel for underlying LUT inflammation.

TI  - Chinese Processual Holism and Its Attitude Towards "Barbarians" and Non-Humans
T2  - SOPHIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper argues that the 'processual holism' of Chinese metaphysics explains its characteristic attitude towards non-humans such as animals and demons. As all things are constantly in process and form a continuum, it follows that ontological distinctions between 'species' become impossible to delimit. The distinctions one makes are instead understood as perspectival and provisional. These metaphysical assumptions explain the lack of interest in the Chinese tradition for classifying the distinctions between humans and non-human. We see many examples of the different schools of philosophy espousing the view that the distinction between humans and non-humans is tenuous, precarious and subject to change. A key implication that follows is that the Chinese worldview saw no ontological distinction between those considered as 'Chinese' and as 'non-Chinese.' The unavailability of ontological distinction (in the strong sense that ontological distinctions accurately represent the divisions of reality) as an explanation for the existence of difference means that phenomena that are perceived as anomalous, such as ghosts and spirits, are attributed to theperspectiveof the human agent; anomaly/difference isnotunderstood as ontological.

TI  - Estimation of volumetric surface soil moisture content using microwave-calibrated soil evaporative efficiency information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a critical variable in energy and water partitioning at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere. In this study, we provided a robust method to retrieve soil moisture using optimal remotely sensed soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) information. Specifically, SEE was deduced from the triangle space constituted by remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and fractional vegetation cover (Fc). Theoretical solutions of the dry and wet boundaries were derived by annual-scale optimization and microwave SM calibration. The two limits of SM were obtained by linear fit function between SEE and microwave-based SM. The proposed method was validated at the Liaoning Province of China in the year 2011 by using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite images as input. Results indicated that the new method has not only bypassed the complex parametric scheme in the calculation of boundaries within the LST-Fc feature space but also performed superior in the estimation of soil moisture status at all-sky days. Besides, the optimal method has reproduced the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture reasonably well, with a root mean square error of 0.07 m(3) m(-3). Therefore, the proposed method can be regarded as a suitable tool to provide accurate and continuous monitoring of soil moisture.

TI  - Cold water anomalies in the middle layer of the northern Taiwan Strait in spring-a numerical approach
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cold water anomalies were found in the middle layer in the northern Taiwan Strait in the spring of 2015. The cold water was located at a depth of approximately 10-20 m, with warm water situated both above and below this cold water layer. This study investigated this phenomenon using a three-dimensional operational ocean model, in which the sea-surface net heat flux was justified by nudging the appropriate sea-surface temperature (SST) obtained from remote sensing data while maintaining a reasonable modeling skill level with respect to other parameters. The cold water anomaly phenomena were reproduced reasonably well in the model, and the mechanism can be determined by dynamic process analysis and thermal diagnosis of the model results. In the spring of 2015, when the northeasterly monsoon in the Taiwan Strait relaxed and changed to southwesterly, the offshore movement, which was related to both the geostrophic adjustment and Ekman transport in the upper layer, was supplemented by the bottom Ekman onshore transport at the lower level, which resulted in the presence of warm water at the bottom. Meanwhile, the increased solar radiation heated the water at the surface. In the model diagnostic analysis, such warming effects can be demonstrated by cross-strait horizontal advection and vertical diffusion, while in the middle layer, the warming effect was not particularly significant, which was the cause of the cold water anomaly.

TI  - Optimization of Optical Image Geometric Modeling, Application to Topography Extraction and Topographic Change Measurements Using PlanetScope and SkySat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The volume of data generated by earth observation satellites has increased tremendously over the last few decades and will increase further in the coming decade thanks in particular to the launch of nanosatellites constellations. These data should open new avenues for Earth surface monitoring due to highly improved spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. Many applications depend, however, on the accuracy of the image geometric model. The geometry of optical images, whether acquired from pushbroom or frame systems, is now commonly represented using a Rational Function Model (RFM). While the formalism has become standard, the procedures used to generate these models and their accuracies are diverse. As a result, the RFM models delivered with commercial data are commonly not accurate enough for 3-D extraction, subpixel registration or ground deformation measurements. In this study, we present a methodology for RFM optimization and demonstrate its potential for 3D reconstruction using tri-stereo and multi-date Cubesat images provided by SkySat and PlanetScope, respectively. We use SkySat data over the Morenci Mine, Arizona, which is the largest copper mine in the United States. The re-projection error after the RFM refinement is 0.42 pix without using ground control points (GCPs). Comparison of our Digital Elevation Model (DEM with similar to 3 m GSD) with a reference DEM obtained from an airborne LiDAR survey (with similar to 1 m GSD) over stable areas yields a standard deviation of the elevation differences of similar to 3.9 m. The comparison of the two DEMs allows detecting and measuring the topographic changes due to the mine activity (excavation and stockpiles). We assess the potential of PlanetScope data, using multi-date DOVE-C images from the Shisper glacier, located in the Karakoram (Pakistan), which is known for its recent surge. We extracted DEMs in 2017 and 2019 before and after the surge. The re-projection error after the RFM refinement is 0.38 pix without using GCPs. The accuracy of our DEMs (with similar to 9 m GSD) is evaluated through comparison with the SRTM DEM (GSD similar to 30 m) and with a DEM (GSD similar to 2 m) calculated from Geoeye-1 (GE-1) and World-View-2 (WV-2) stereo images. The standard deviation of the elevation differences in stable areas between the PlanetScope DEM and SRTM is similar to 12 m, and similar to 7 m with the GE-1&WV-2 DEM. The mass transfer due to the surge is clearly revealed from a comparison of the 2017 and 2019 DEMs. The study demonstrates that, with the proposed scheme for RFM optimization, times series of DEM extracted from SkySat and PlanetScope images can be used to measure topographic changes due to mining activities or ice flow, and could also be used to monitor geomorphic processes such as landslides, or coastal erosion for example.

TI  - REKINDLING THE SPIRIT OF HUMANISM: THE "WORLDVIEW" PAPER
T2  - CLASSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many classical scholars have fretted about the disconnect between undergraduate instruction in Greco-Roman antiquity and the spirit of humanism. As classical studies have professionalized, an undergraduate education in the discipline has become decreasingly linked to the humanist goal of creating more ethical and introspective adults. This article suggests one means of rekindling humanism in the undergraduate Latin or Greek classroom: professors can assign a "worldview" paper. Such a paper gives students the opportunity to use Greek and Latin literary works to contemplate a sound philosophy of life.

TI  - On the Assessment of Non-Local Multi-Looking in Detection of Persistent Scatterers Using SAR Tomography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography has shown great potential in multi-dimensional monitoring of urban infrastructures and detection of their possible slow deformations. Along this line, undeniable improvements in SAR tomography (TomoSAR) detection framework of multiple permanent scatterers (PSs) have been observed by the use of a multi-looking operation that is the necessity for data's covariance matrix estimation. This paper attempts to further analyze the impact of a robust multi-looking operation in TomoSAR PS detection framework and assess the challenging issues that exist in the estimation of the covariance matrix of large stack data obtained from long interferometric time series acquisition. The analyses evaluate the performance of non-local covariance matrix estimation approaches in PS detection framework using the super-resolution multi-looked Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). Experimental results of multi-looking impact assessment are provided using two datasets acquired by COSMO-SkyMED (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) over Tehran, Iran, and Toulouse, France, respectively. The results highlight that non-local estimation of the sample covariance matrix allows revealing the presence of the scatterers, that may not be detectable using the conventional local-based framework.

TI  - Using the MODIS Sensor for Snow Cover Modeling and the Assessment of Drought Effects on Snow Cover in a Mountainous Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is one of the essential factors in hydrology, freshwater resources, irrigation, travel, pastimes, floods, avalanches, and vegetation. In this study, the snow cover of the northern and southern slopes of Alborz Mountains in Iran was investigated by considering two issues: (1) Estimating the snow cover area and the (2) effects of droughts on snow cover. The snow cover data were monitored by images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The meteorological data (including the precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, global solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind velocity) were prepared by a combination of National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) points and meteorological stations. The data scale was monthly and belonged to the 2000-2014 period. In the first part of the study, snow cover estimation was conducted by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and MLP with Grey Wolf Optimization (MLP-GWO) models. The most accurate estimations were produced by the MLP-GWO and GMDH models. The models produced better snow cover estimations for the northern slope compared to the southern slope. The GWO improved the MLP's accuracy by 10.7%. In the second part, seven drought indices, including the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Bahlme-Mooley Drought Index (BMDI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Multivariate Standardized Precipitation Index (MSPI), Modified Standardized Precipitation Index (SPImod), Joint Deficit Index (JDI), and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were calculated for both slopes. The results showed that the effects of a drought event on the snow cover area would remain up to 5 (or 6) months in the region. The highest impact of drought appears after two months in the snow cover area, and the drought index most related to snow cover variations is the 2-month time window of SPI (SPI2). The results of both subjects were promising and the methods can be examined in other snowy areas of the world.

TI  - Identifying Spanish Areas at More Risk of Monthly BTV Transmission with a Basic Reproduction Number Approach
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes a disease that is endemic in Spain and its two major biological vector species, C. imicola and the Obsoletus complex species, differ greatly in their ecology and distribution. Understanding the seasonality of BTV transmission in risk areas is key to improving surveillance and control programs, as well as to better understand the pathogen transmission networks between wildlife and livestock. Here, monthly risk transmission maps were generated using risk categories based on well-known BTV R-0 equations and predicted abundances of the two most relevant vectors in Spain. Previously, Culicoides spp. predicted abundances in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands were obtained using remote sensing data and random forest machine learning algorithm. Risk transmission maps were externally assessed with the estimated date of infection of BTV-1 and BTV-4 historical outbreaks. Our results highlight the differences in risk transmission during April-October, June-August being the period with higher R-0 values. Likewise, a natural barrier has been identified between northern and central-southern areas at risk that may hamper BTV spread between them. Our results can be relevant to implement risk-based interventions for the prevention, control and surveillance of BTV and other diseases shared between livestock and wildlife host populations.

TI  - Model Based Change Detection of Water Body Using Landsat Imagery: A Case Study of Rajshahi Bangladesh
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - This study detected water bodies which included ponds, lakes, rivers, canals, irrigation land, etc. from Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) data by Pixel Based Model (PBM) for the years 2000 to 2018 and identified the change in area of water body. Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh was selected as the study area for this case study. Landsat 5 data acquired in December 18th, 2000, January 12th, 2001, November 14th, 2005, January 26th, 2006, December 23rd, 2010, and December 14th, 2010 along with Landsat 8 data acquired in December 28th, 2015, January 6th, 2016, December 29th, 2018, and November 18th, 2018 were used as satellite imagery for this analysis. Two images of each month were taken to cover study area. The lowest and highest pixel value of the water body for each band was investigated. Then, a Pixel Based Model (PBM) was formed by using the entire Landsat band and run. The output of the model was shown as a binary image which includes water bodies and non-water bodies. The goal of this study is to verify the accuracy in finding common areas, accreted areas and abolished areas of the water bodies using the PBM model. The results show that overall accuracy of the model is 97% for the year 2000 with Kappa 0.94, 97% for the year 2005 with Kappa 0.94, 99% for the year 2010 with Kappa 0.98, 95% for the year 2015 and 2018 with Kappa 0.90. Also, it was observed that there have been significant changes in the water bodies during the chosen time periods.

TI  - Identification of suitable sites and structures for artificial groundwater recharge for sustainable groundwater resource development and management
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial recharge is the process of augmentation of the natural infiltration of precipitation or surface water into aquifers by some methods of construction, spreading of water or by artificially changing natural conditions. Upper Betwa watershed, has been taken under study is a semi-arid region, part of Obedullahganj block, Raisen district, M.P., India. The area is hard rock terrain with rugged topography and varying geology. Long term analysis of groundwater level conducted by CGWB, Bhopal has shown sharp decline in groundwater level from past one decade. To increase the groundwater potential of the area, action plan for artificial groundwater recharge has been developed using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Survey of India toposheet no's 55 E/8, 55 E/12, 55 F/5 & 55 F/9, GSI, 2002 resource map, LANDSAT 8, and SRTM (DEM) satellite data and NBSS&LUP soil map were processed in ArcGIS to prepare the various thematic layers viz. Geology, geomorphology, topography, soil, land use/land cover, slope, lineament, drainage and drainage density. Sub-watershed wise action plan of the area has been developed for the area using these thematic layers following the criteria given by NRSA, 1995. In the action plan, development of water harvesting structures (Check dam, Nala bund, Contour bund, Gully plug etc.) were proposed. These structures will provide a measure of artificial recharge in this hard rock terrain by collecting of the surface runoff and increasing the surface area of infiltration. Further, the developed action plan addresses identification of sites for groundwater recharge, through the anticipated artificial recharge structures. Thus, it is suggested that execution of the proposed sub-watershed wise action plan will help in development and management of groundwater resources of the area. Excavation of the proposed structures at their suitable sites identified will enhance the groundwater recharge potential of the area.

TI  - APOSTASY AND THE APOSTATE MAN IN ESCHATOLOGICAL PRESENTIMENTS OF RUSSIAN RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the presented research is determined by the fact that eschatological presentiments in Russian religious and philosophical thought reveal the future of the problem of good and evil. Eschatological problems investigated in the context of religious and philosophical discourse contribute to a more in-depth analysis of the ontological causes of social conflicts, violence phenomena, as these problems draw our attention to the spiritual and moral phenomenon of apostasy. The church legal concept and definition of apostasy, too focused on external anti-clerical forms of apostasy (accentuated on its external features), does not give a complete picture and does not reveal the full depth and multi-dimensionality of this phenomenon. The phenomenon of apostasy, if it is not reduced only to the manifestations of the church legal historical reality and signs that qualify the rejection of faith, is a deep and multifaceted phenomenon of spiritual and moral life of the individual, which has a direct impact on culture and society. Existing in the context of Judeo-Christian discourse, it can be characterized not only by external and internal apostasy from the faith and the church. It often becomes a dangerous and hypocritical form of apostasy and from all existential good, love, humanity as a whole, that is, acquires a certain global significance. The article considers the sources of the Russian religious and philosophical tradition, which reveal the problem identified in the title of the article in the context of apostasy as a phenomenon of apostasy from the value foundations of spiritual and existential goodness. The general directions in approaches of Russian religious philosophers to the theme of eschatology are revealed. The aim of the work is to show the importance and relevance of spiritual and moral issues, the choice of good and evil to deepen the modern philosophical discourse in the direction of prevention of interreligious, public and social conflicts, violence, extremism, and terrorism. Russian religious and philosophical thought came to understand the insolubility of the problem of evil, only in the context of the church ascetic worldview, but thoroughly confirmed the need and importance of spiritual and moral life. The eschatological direction of Russian religious and philosophical thought mainly correlates with the Eastern Christian cultural tradition and focuses on understanding the universal problems of the fate of the world and man, salvation and death, life and death, good and evil. Being outside the church legal and religious philosophical understanding, this phenomenon has acquired large-scale development prospects, rebelling on the spiritual and moral foundations of human life. It has become not only an external, but also internal characteristic of a person. This is confirmed by the extraordinary development of the phenomena of violence, extremism, and terrorism. But the movement of apostasy towards the peak of its development is not yet complete. These processes again turn our attention not to the external forms of apostasy, but to its deep essence. Hence the need arises to transfer the analysis of apostasy from the field of the church legal, cultural historical, and prophetic to the field of the spiritual moral, ethical.

T2  - REVISTA INCLUSIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the backdrop of globalization, which encompasses all spheres of modern culture, it is impossible to stay in a confined civilizational space in the presence of religious diversity existing in the world. In this context, research into the religious and worldview paradigms of Hinduism presented in its literary heritage as one of the sources is highly relevant, especially considering the fact that Hinduism is, in fact, an umbrella term denoting a vast array of faiths practiced by over 800 million people in the world, 96% of whom are Indian. The article analyzes the role of the Puranas in the Hindu tradition, provides an overview of the Puranic literature and its main specific features and summarizes the characteristics of the Vayu Purana as a monument of Puranic literature. The authors draw a conclusion that the Vayu Purana can be considered one of the most outstanding pieces of medieval Indian literature.

TI  - Relating the Land-Use Changes to the Invasion of <i>Pneumatopteris afra</i> in Nigeria Using Remote Sensing
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed at using satellite remote sensing in identifying the land-use changes that have occurred in Lafia, Nigeria within the past 35 years, especially in relation to the current and the predicted future invasion of a fern (Pneumatopteris afra). Landsat satellite images OLI/TIRS, ETM+ and TM within the interval of 15 years from 1985 to 2020 were used for the extraction of land-use. Six broad classification systems were used to classify the land-use changes by employing a supervised classification technique. In 1985, the bare land dominated the land-use having an area of 69156 ha while the wetland was the least having an area of 3412 ha. However, in 2020, the built-up area has dominated the land-use of Lafia with an area of 144645 ha (52.21%) while the wetland still remained the least with area of 1477 ha. This is obviously due to the geometric increase in the urbanization of this city. There was a consistent loss of the forests from 1985 to 2020 with an annual rate of loss of 0.46%. This resulted in a loss of 44329 ha of forests in 2020 out of the 47643 ha in 1985. This approximately leads to a total loss of 172,732,045 USD of forest products. The current invasion of Pneumatopteris afra in Lafia was found to fall within the shrub and grasses land-use class. This indicates that the landsat satellite could not detect the wetlands where the plant dominated due to its massive covering. This study calls for immediate conservation of the remaining forests and wetlands in Lafia to prevent further encroachments and invasion by plants.

TI  - Sensors, Features, and Machine Learning for Oil Spill Detection and Monitoring: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing technologies and machine learning (ML) algorithms play an increasingly important role in accurate detection and monitoring of oil spill slicks, assisting scientists in forecasting their trajectories, developing clean-up plans, taking timely and urgent actions, and applying effective treatments to contain and alleviate adverse effects. Review and analysis of different sources of remotely sensed data and various components of ML classification systems for oil spill detection and monitoring are presented in this study. More than 100 publications in the field of oil spill remote sensing, published in the past 10 years, are reviewed in this paper. The first part of this review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different sources of remotely sensed data used for oil spill detection. Necessary preprocessing and preparation of data for developing classification models are then highlighted. Feature extraction, feature selection, and widely used handcrafted features for oil spill detection are subsequently introduced and analyzed. The second part of this review explains the use and capabilities of different classical and developed state-of-the-art ML techniques for oil spill detection. Finally, an in-depth discussion on limitations, open challenges, considerations of oil spill classification systems using remote sensing, and state-of-the-art ML algorithms are highlighted along with conclusions and insights into future directions.

TI  - Constructing Causal Networks Through Regressions: A Tutorial
T2  - QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Significant progress has been made in the practice of conducting causal analysis using network models. Despite this progress, there is limited evidence that hospital risk managers are using these analytical models. Objective: This article introduces the causal network, its related concepts, and methods of analysis. The article demonstrates how hospital risk managers can use existing regression software to construct a causal network and identify root causes of an adverse event. Methods: Causal networks depict cause and effect in a set of variables. In this context, causes are strong correlations that meet 3 additional criteria: (1) causes occur prior to effects, (2) there is an articulated mechanism for how causes lead to effects, and (3) the association between cause and effect is not spurious, meaning the association persists even after other variables are statistically controlled for (a method of analysis called counterfactual). A causal network can be constructed through repeated use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. In the proposed regressions, the response variable is any variable in the data. The independent variables are variables that occur prior to the response variable. By design, the statistically significant coefficients in the time-constrained LASSO regressions identify "direct" causes of the response variables. When direct causes of all variables are identified, then the entire network model, including root causes, has been specified. In the final step, the parameters of the network model (ie, strength of causal associations) are estimated by fitting the network structure to the available data. We demonstrate these concepts through fitting a network model to simulated data for causes of excessive boarding in emergency departments. Results: The network (involving 12 causes, over 4 periods, and 1 sentinel event) was accurately recovered from the simulated case reports. The recovered network did not differ from the original network used to simulate the data in any of the 156 possible links. The recovered network allowed the identification of root and direct causes. It showed that hospital occupancy rate, and not emergency department efficiency, was root cause of excessive emergency department boarding. Discussion: Causal networks can provide insights into root, and direct, causes of an adverse event. These models provide empirical tests of causes of adverse events. We encourage the use of these methods by hospital risk managers.

TI  - GIS-based comparative assessment of flood susceptibility mapping using hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach, naive Bayes tree, bivariate statistics and logistic regression: A case of Topla basin, Slovakia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is a devastating natural hazard that may cause damage to the environment infrastructure, and society. Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Topla river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (Naive Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the experts' decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive.

TI  - Indocyanine Green-Enhanced Colorectal Surgery-between Being Superfluous and Being a Game-Changer
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Nowadays, surgical innovations incorporate new technological conquests and must be validated by evidence-based medicine. The use of augmented reality-assisted indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence has generated a myriad of intraoperative applications such as demonstration of key anatomical landmarks, sentinel lymph nodes, and real-time assessment of local blood flow. This paper presents a systematic review of the clinical evidence regarding the applications of ICG near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in colorectal surgery. After we removed duplicate publications and screened for eligibility, a total of 36 articles were evaluated: 23 on perfusion assessment, 10 on lymph node mapping, and 3 on intraoperative identification of ureters. Lack of homogenous studies, low statistical power, and confounding evidence were found to be common amongst publications supporting the use of ICG in colorectal surgery, raising concerns over this seductive technique ' s cost efficiency and redundancy. The compiled data showed that ICG NIR fluorescence may be a game-changer in particular situations, as proven for low colorectal anastomosis or lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, but it remains controversial for routine use and sentinel lymph node assessment. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm these conclusions. Future research directions include tumor-targeted fluorescence imaging and digital software for quantitative evaluation of fluorescence.

TI  - <i>TP53</i> mutation and tumoral PD-L1 expression are associated with depth of invasion in desmoplastic melanomas
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Desmoplastic melanoma ( DM) is a rare subtype of spindle cell malignant melanoma characterized by frequent local recurrences and hematogenous spread, but without molecular classification. The aim of the study was to investigate in a DM series the incidence of relevant gene alterations in cancer, the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status and the association with clinicopathological features and melanoma progression.Methods: A total of 38 patients were included. Clinical follow-up and the histopathological features of all cases were retrospectively collected. PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and BRAF genomic alterations by real-time PCR were determined in 34 samples. Additionally, a molecular analysis by next-generation sequencing was performed in 25 DMs.Results: Tumors occurred predominantly in men (76%) and in the head and neck region (50%). Most tumors were pure DMs (66%), containing less than 10% of conventional melanoma. Overall, 48% of our cohort harbored TP53 mutations, most of them showing a molecular signature associated with ultraviolet (UV)-oncogenesis, and 29%, BRAF mutations. A positive correlation between TP53 with depth of invasion (P=0.005) and presence of elastosis (P=0.002) was found. High-expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells was observed in 38% of cases and correlated with depth of tumoral infiltration ( P=0.003), TP53 ( P=0.016), PD-1 (P<0.001) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) (P<0.001). PD-L1 expression in immune cells correlated with PD-1 ( P=0.006), tumoral PD-L1 expression (P=0.029) and TP53 mutation (P=0.002). Survival correlated with depth of invasion (P=0.003), stage of tumors (P=0.015), positive sentinel lymph node (P=0.004), lymph node metastasis (P=0.024) and distant metastasis (P<0.001).Conclusions: Our results suggest that progressed DMs with deep tumoral infiltration frequently harbor TP53 mutations, PD-L1 expression and present a high inflammatory response, probably related to adaptive immune resistance in this tumor-type.

TI  - Spatial estimation of chronic respiratory diseases based on machine learning procedures-an approach using remote sensing data and environmental variables in quito, Ecuador
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few years, the use of remote sensing data in different applications such as estimation of air pollution concentration and health applications has become very popular and new. Thus, some studies have established a possible relationship between environmental variables and respiratory health parameters. This study proposes to estimate the prevalence of Chronic Respiratory Diseases, where there is a relationship between remote sensing data (Landsat 8) and environmental variables (air pollution and meteorological data) to determine the number of hospital discharges of patients with chronic respiratory diseases in Quito, Ecuador, between 2013 and 2017. The main objective of this study is to establish and evaluate an alternative LUR model that is capable of estimate the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, in contrast with traditional LUR models, which typically assess air pollutants. Moreover, this study also evaluates different analytic techniques (multiple linear regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and random forest regression) that often form the basis of spatial models. The results show that machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine, are the most effective in computing such models, presenting the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE). Additionally, in this study, we show that the most significant remote sensing predictors are the blue and infrared bands. Our proposed model is a spatial modeling approach that is capable of determining the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases in the city of Quito, which can serve as a useful tool for health authorities in policy- and decision-making.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Distribution in a Multi-Use Savannah Landscape in Southeastern Kenya: Impact of Land Use and Fences
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannahs provide valuable ecosystem services and contribute to continental and global carbon budgets. In addition, savannahs exhibit multiple land uses, e.g., wildlife conservation, pastoralism, and crop farming. Despite their importance, the effect of land use on woody aboveground biomass (AGB) in savannahs is understudied. Furthermore, fences used to reduce human-wildlife conflicts may affect AGB patterns. We assessed AGB densities and patterns, and the effect of land use and fences on AGB in a multi-use savannah landscape in southeastern Kenya. AGB was assessed with field survey and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, and a land cover map was developed using Sentinel-2 satellite images in Google Earth Engine. The highest woody AGB was found in riverine forest in a conservation area and in bushland outside the conservation area. The highest mean AGB density occurred in the non-conservation area with mixed bushland and cropland (8.9 Mg center dot ha(-1)), while the lowest AGB density (2.6 Mg center dot ha(-1)) occurred in overgrazed grassland in the conservation area. The largest differences in AGB distributions were observed in the fenced boundaries between the conservation and other land-use types. Our results provide evidence that conservation and fences can create sharp AGB transitions and lead to reduced AGB stocks, which is a vital role of savannahs as part of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Ecotourism site suitability evaluation using geospatial technologies: a case of Andiracha district, Ethiopia
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed to identify potential ecotourism sites using Geographic Information System and Multi-criteria Decision Analysis in Adiracha district of Sheka Zone, south-western Ethiopia. Landsat ETM Image and STRM data of 2016 with 30 m resolution and topographic map of Ethiopia were used in this study. Ecotourism potential site selection criteria were designed based on 26 stakeholder's opinions. The final suitability map of ecotourism has been realized by applying an integrated weighted overlay technique of Geographic Information System. The suitability map was categorized into four classes as Suitable, Moderately Suitable, Less Suitable, and Not Suitable. The study attempts to indicate the level of ecotourism suitability at different location in the study area. The outcome of this research is useful to understand the spatial information of Sheka district that can be used for policy makers. This study can be also used as a basis for assessing ecotourism site suitability in other regions.

TI  - Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Four Tanzanian Villages-A View from the Ground and the Sky
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification based on smallholders is among many economists viewed as a necessary developmental path to ensure food security and poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasingly, a one-sided focus on raising productivity in cereals has been questioned on environmental grounds, with the concept of sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) emerging from the natural sciences as a way of advancing environmental and social needs simultaneously. SAI approaches have, however, been criticized for being both conceptually and methodologically vague. This study combines socioeconomic survey data with remotely sensed land productivity data and qualitative data from four villages in Tanzania. By triangulating and comparing data collected through ground level surveys and ground-truthing with remote sensing data, we find that this combination of methods is capable of resolving some of the theoretical and methodological vagueness found in SAI approaches. The results show the problems of relying on only one type of data when studying sustainable agricultural intensification and indicate the poor environmental outcomes of cereal monocropping, even when social outcomes may be forthcoming. We identify land use practices that can be considered both socially and environmentally sustainable. Theoretically, we contribute to a further problematization of the SAI concept.

TI  - Aquifer characterization using vertical electrical soundings and remote sensing: A case study of the Chott Ech Chergui Basin, Northwest Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to provide detailed geological and structural information about groundwater aquifers in the Chott Ech Chergui region using geophysical and remote sensing data. The Chott Chergui region is a large endorheic depression situated in the northwestern part of Algeria. It is submerged in water, and for that reason, it is considered to be a humid zone even though the region is considered to be a semiarid area. The largest quantities of water come from the northern mountains of Saida and Tlemcen. Some water recharge comes from the Ksour and Amour mountains to the south. Large amounts of this water reach the underground aquifers through a dense fracture network. These water resources are stored in a lithological complex that is composed of three closely related aquifer formations, namely, the continental Tertiary aquifer, the Senonian aquifer and the Aaleno-Bathonian aquifer.The Kheiter and Ain Skhouna areas are known for their gushing water springs that exhibit high flow rates (80 1/s for Ain Skhouna). It is for this reason that we focus on these two regions to understand their flow mechanisms and attempt to construct a conceptual model that illustrates the functional mechanism of the Ain Skhouna spring.This work was accomplished employing a combined approach involving Remote Sensing method and electrical resistivity, specifically, the vertical electrical sounding (VES) technique. The VES technique was used to understand the aquifer geometries and their spatial extents, while the remote sensing results were used to detect some structures and lineaments that favor groundwater exploration. The aquifer geometry was analysed by integrating the results obtained from the interpretations of VES with stratigraphic columns of wells and boreholes using a geographic information system. The results of this study show that three geological levels present aquifer potentialities. The geologic zones are the Aaleno-Bathonian aquifer, which is the most important aquifer in the study area with an average thickness of 250 m, the Senonian aquifer and Tertiary aquifer. The aquifers recharge mainly from fractures in the Saida and Tlemcen Mountains for the Aaleno-Bathonian aquifer, and from direct infiltration from the accumulated surface waters for the Senonian and Tertiary aquifers. Many water sources are sporadically distributed in the Chott Ech Chergui, but the gushing waters seems to be controlled by E-W accidents, especially in Ain Skhouna hot spring. A schematic model of the spring is presented.

TI  - Modeling Spatial Flood using Novel Ensemble Artificial Intelligence Approaches in Northern Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty of flash flood makes them highly difficult to predict through conventional models. The physical hydrologic models of flash flood prediction of any large area is very difficult to compute as it requires lot of data and time. Therefore remote sensing data based models (from statistical to machine learning) have become highly popular due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood modeling through novel hybrid machine learning models, which can improve the prediction accuracy. The hybrid machine learning ensemble approaches that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace, and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables were used to model the FS. Several threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics (TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.87, and TSS of 0.78, has become the most effective ensemble in predicting the FS. The FR technique also showed good performance and reliability for all models. Map removal sensitivity analysis (MRSA) revealed that the FS maps have the highest sensitivity to elevation. Based on the findings of the validation methods, the FS maps prepared using the machine learning ensemble techniques have high robustness and can be used to advise flood management initiatives in flood-prone areas.

TI  - Data Retrieval Method based on Physical Meaning and its Application for Prediction of Linear Precipitation Zone with Remote Sensing Satellite Data and Open Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data retrieval method based on physical meaning is proposed together with its application for prediction of linear precipitation zone with remote sensing satellite data and open data. The linear precipitation zone causes extremely severe storm and flood damage, landslide, and so on. Linear precipitation zone is formed in the case that the warm, moist air must continuously flow in, the force to lift this air up and it is often in collisions with mountain slopes or cold fronts, the atmospheric conditions are unstable, and there is a certain direction of wind above the sky. These conditions can be monitored by remote sensing satellite data. The proposed method is intended to attempt for prediction of the linear precipitation zone for disaster mitigation. There are water vapor data, cloud liquid data, cloud fraction data, and upper atmospheric wind data derived from the remote sensing satellite-based mission instruments. Through experiment in the case of the linear precipitation zone which was occurred in northern Kyushu, Japan in the begging of July 2020, a possibility to detect the linear precipitation zone was confirmed. Also, flooding damages and other disasters occurred in the northern Kyushu, in same time period caused by the detected linear precipitation zone is detected with Sentinel-1 of SAR data.

TI  - Applications of Computational Methods in Biomedical Breast Cancer Imaging Diagnostics: A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the exponential increase in new cases coupled with an increased mortality rate, cancer has ranked as the second most prevalent cause of death in the world. Early detection is paramount for suitable diagnosis and effective treatment of different kinds of cancers, but this is limited to the accuracy and sensitivity of available diagnostic imaging methods. Breast cancer is the most widely diagnosed cancer among women across the globe with a high percentage of total cancer deaths requiring an intensive, accurate, and sensitive imaging approach. Indeed, it is treatable when detected at an early stage. Hence, the use of state of the art computational approaches has been proposed as a potential alternative approach for the design and development of novel diagnostic imaging methods for breast cancer. Thus, this review provides a concise overview of past and present conventional diagnostics approaches in breast cancer detection. Further, we gave an account of several computational models (machine learning, deep learning, and robotics), which have been developed and can serve as alternative techniques for breast cancer diagnostics imaging. This review will be helpful to academia, medical practitioners, and others for further study in this area to improve the biomedical breast cancer imaging diagnosis.

TI  - Incorporating environmental variables, remote and proximal sensing data for digital soil mapping of USDA soil great groups
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of combining proximal, and remote sensing with environmental variables for predicting USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) soil great groups (the third hierarchical level of USDA soil classification system) in a semi-arid region located at Jouneqan district in Chaharmahal & Bakhtiary province, Iran. Accordingly, two predictive models, including support vector machine (SVM), and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) using different covariates, including lithology, geomorphology, remote sensing-derived vegetation indices, DEM (digital elevation model)-derived attributes, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy-derived soil colour qualifiers, and magnetic susceptibility were examined. A total of 102 soil profiles were excavated, described, and classified up to the great group level, and soil samples were collected from various genetic horizons. The cross validation leave-one-out (LOOCV) was used as validation approach, and the performance of the models was assessed using the kappa coefficient (kappa), and overall accuracy. Results showed that considering the kappa values (kappa = 0.6-0.8), the classification performance identified as substantial for both MLR, and SVM when geospatial data, soil colour qualifiers, and magnetic susceptibility were used together as predictors. However, the MLR classifier outperformed SVM (kappa: 0.78, and 0.66, respectively). Chroma, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), geomorphology map, and some terrain attributes, including slope were among the most important predictors. Our findings confirmed that combining geospatial data, and proximal sensing information in multivariate classification algorithms could improve soil classification accuracy in a quick, and cost-efficient way.

TI  - Using remote sensing to calculate floating photovoltaic technical potential of a dam's surface
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A dam with a hydroelectric power plant (HEPP) prevents flooding while generating electricity and providing controlled irrigation of agricultural land. An open dam surface causes a substantial loss in water resources over the course of a year due to evaporation. In this paper, the authors propose to occupy the idle dam area with a floating photovoltaic (FPV) solar power plant (SPP) to generate electrical energy and to conserve water by minimizing evaporation. Since the shoreline of a dam used for agricultural irrigation continually changes, the most critical challenge in installing a SPP is to determine the suitable area to be covered with FPV panels. In this study, the shoreline changes of the Demirkopru Dam in Manisa, Turkey, were monitored over 20 years from Landsat and Sentinel satellite images using the supervised classification in the Google Earth Engine. The minimum surface area of the dam was found to be 1,562.45 ha. Installing a 2.03 GWp FPV SPP horizontally on this surface and obtaining 3,328.33 GWh annual energy is feasible. Moreover, the FPV panels can prevent 28,231,026.90 m(3) of water from evaporating. Approximately 7.82% of the water used for electricity production in 2019 can be recovered with the installation of this SPP.

TI  - Spatial Variation of Land Use/Cover Composition and Impact on Surface Urban Heat Island in a Tropical Sub-Saharan City of Accra, Ghana
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is one of the most crucial issues in the world of the 21st century. Notably, the urban heat island phenomenon is becoming more prominent in megacities and their hinterlands in temperate and subtropical climatic regions. In the daytime in summer, there exists a high possibility of accelerating the land surface temperature (LST) in desert cities, due to the alterations made by human beings in the natural environment. In this study, we investigate the spatial formation of LST in a tropical sub-Saharan city of Accra, a gateway to West Africa, using Landsat data in 2003 and 2017. Machine learning techniques and the different spatial and statistical methods such as tasseled cap transformation (TCT), urban-rural gradient, and multiresolution grid-based and landscape metrics were employed to examine procured land use/cover (LUC) and LST maps. LUC was classified into five categories: Built up, Green 1, Green 2, Bare land, and Water. The results of the analysis indicate that Built up, Green 2, and Bare land had caused the highest heating effect while Green 1 and Water had caused the considerable cooling effect during the daytime in Accra. The urban-rural difference in LST recorded 1.4 degrees C in 2003 and 0.28 degrees C in 2017. The mean size, mean shape, largest patch, and aggregation of Built up, Green 1, and Green 2 had a strong relationship with the mean LST. It is essential for urban planners to carefully examine the formation and effect of the urban heat island (UHI) for sustainable urban development and landscape policy toward mitigation and adaptation planning in Accra.

TI  - Probabilistic Mapping and Spatial Pattern Analysis of Grazing Lawns in Southern African Savannahs Using WorldView-3 Imagery and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannah grazing lawns are a key food resource for large herbivores such as blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) and white rhino (Ceratotherium simum), and impact herbivore densities, movement and recruitment rates. They also exert a strong influence on fire behaviour including frequency, intensity and spread. Thus, variation in grazing lawn cover can have a profound impact on broader savannah ecosystem dynamics. However, knowledge of their present cover and distribution is limited. Importantly, we lack a robust, broad-scale approach for detecting and monitoring grazing lawns, which is critical to enhancing understanding of the ecology of these vital grassland systems. We selected two sites in the Lower Sabie and Satara regions of Kruger National Park, South Africa with mesic and semiarid conditions, respectively. Using spectral and texture features derived from WorldView-3 imagery, we (i) parameterised and assessed the quality of Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models for general discrimination of plant functional types (PFTs) within a sub-area of the Lower Sabie landscape, and (ii) compared model performance for probabilistic mapping of grazing lawns in the broader Lower Sabie and Satara landscapes. Further, we used spatial metrics to analyse spatial patterns in grazing lawn distribution in both landscapes along a gradient of distance from waterbodies. All machine learning models achieved high F-scores (F1) and overall accuracy (OA) scores in general savannah PFTs classification, with RF (F1 = 95.73 +/- 0.004%, OA = 94.16 +/- 0.004%), SVM (F1 = 95.64 +/- 0.002%, OA = 94.02 +/- 0.002%) and MLP (F1 = 95.71 +/- 0.003%, OA = 94.27 +/- 0.003%) forming a cluster of the better performing models and marginally outperforming CART (F1 = 92.74 +/- 0.006%, OA = 90.93 +/- 0.003%). Grazing lawn detection accuracy followed a similar trend within the Lower Sabie landscape, with RF, SVM, MLP and CART achieving F-scores of 0.89, 0.93, 0.94 and 0.81, respectively. Transferring models to the Satara landscape however resulted in relatively lower but high grazing lawn detection accuracies across models (RF = 0.87, SVM = 0.88, MLP = 0.85 and CART = 0.75). Results from spatial pattern analysis revealed a relatively higher proportion of grazing lawn cover under semiarid savannah conditions (Satara) compared to the mesic savannah landscape (Lower Sabie). Additionally, the results show strong negative correlation between grazing lawn spatial structure (fractional cover, patch size and connectivity) and distance from waterbodies, with larger and contiguous grazing lawn patches occurring in close proximity to waterbodies in both landscapes. The proposed machine learning approach provides a novel and robust workflow for accurate and consistent landscape-scale monitoring of grazing lawns, while our findings and research outputs provide timely information critical for understanding habitat heterogeneity in southern African savannahs.

TI  - Herpetofauna Roadkills on Langkawi Island, Peninsular Malaysia: The Influence of Landscape and Season on Mortality Distribution
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the spatiotemporal variation of herpetofauna roadkills on roadways in Langkawi Island. A total of 131 roadkills were recorded. The species that exhibited greater mortality was Varanus nebulosus (n=72). There was a significant difference in herpetofauna mortality between dry and wet seasons (t(11) = -2.330, p=0.04, <0.05). The spatial pattern was described by using kernel density estimation. Four collision hotspots were concentrated at the west side of the island, adjacent to vegetation area and forest reserve. Species characteristics, road proximity to the forested area, vegetation cover and traffic volume may influence the high rate of madkills found. Installation of warning signs, speed restrictions and temporary mad closings could reduce traffic accident and significantly reduce mortalities. The study represents a significant improvement over previous research on the island by implementing hotspot analysis. We would suggest analysing habitat suitability and connectivity to increase the ability to predict the location of roadkill hotspots.

TI  - Utility of indocyanine green injection in patients with cervical cancer besides the identification of sentinel lymph node (Review)
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to the wide introduction of screening tests, patients with neoplastic diseases of the uterine cervix trend to be diagnosed in early stages of the disease, and less invasive surgical procedures are needed in certain cases. In this respect, the technique of sentinel lymph node dissection has been widely implemented as part of the therapeutic strategy, indocyanine green (ICG) being one of the most reliable markers for sentinel lymph node detection. However, it seems that this agent is extremely useful in order to achieve better short-term and long-term results after cervical cancer surgery, due to its capacity to determine the uterine vascular perfusion in cases in which conservative treatment, such as trachelectomy, is performed, as well as to prevent and treat lower limb lymphedema. A literature review was conducted of the studies which focused on the role of ICG utility in cervical cancer patients besides sentinel lymph node detection, special focus was given to vascularization preservation and lower limb lymphedema prevention and treatment.

TI  - Evaluating the Efficiency of Different Regression, Decision Tree, and Bayesian Machine Learning Algorithms in Spatial Piping Erosion Susceptibility Using ALOS/PALSAR Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Piping erosion is one form of water erosion that leads to significant changes in the landscape and environmental degradation. In the present study, we evaluated piping erosion modeling in the Zarandieh watershed of Markazi province in Iran based on random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and Bayesian generalized linear models (Bayesian GLM) machine learning algorithms. For this goal, due to the importance of various geo-environmental and soil properties in the evolution and creation of piping erosion, 18 variables were considered for modeling the piping erosion susceptibility in the Zarandieh watershed. A total of 152 points of piping erosion were recognized in the study area that were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) for modeling. The area under curve (AUC) was used to assess the effeciency of the RF, SVM, and Bayesian GLM. Piping erosion susceptibility results indicated that all three RF, SVM, and Bayesian GLM models had high efficiency in the testing step, such as the AUC shown with values of 0.9 for RF, 0.88 for SVM, and 0.87 for Bayesian GLM. Altitude, pH, and bulk density were the variables that had the greatest influence on the piping erosion susceptibility in the Zarandieh watershed. This result indicates that geo-environmental and soil chemical variables are accountable for the expansion of piping erosion in the Zarandieh watershed.

TI  - PhenoCrop: An integrated satellite-based framework to estimate physiological growth stages of corn and soybeans
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely estimates of crop physiological growth stages are essential for efficient crop management and precise modeling of agricultural systems. Satellite remote sensing has been widely used to retrieve vegetation phenology metrics at local to global scales. However, most of these phenology metrics (e.g., green-up) are different from crop growth stages (e.g., emergence) used in crop management and modeling. As such, an integrated framework referred to as PhenoCrop was developed to: 1) establish a connection between remote sensing-derived phenology metrics and key crop growth stages based on Wang and Engle plant phenology model and 2) use fused MODIS-Landsat 30m 8-day reflectance data generated using Kalman Filter-based data fusion technique to produce onset dates of key growth stages of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max L.) at 30m spatial resolution. In this paper, we described the PhenoCrop framework, and tested its performance for the State of Nebraska for 2012-2016 by comparison to observations of estimated key growth stages at three experimental sites in eastern Nebraska of USA, and state-level statistical data from Crop Progress Reports (CPRs) published by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS). In addition, to evaluate the suitability of using coarse or high spatial resolution satellite imagery, fused MODIS-Landsat-based estimates were compared with those produced using EOS MODIS 250m (MOD9Q1) reflectance data.The PhenoCrop estimates captured the typical spatial trends of gradual delay in the progression of the growing season from southeast to northwest Nebraska. Also inter-annual differences due to factors such as weather fluctuations and change in management strategies (e.g., early season in 2012) were evident in the estimates. Validation results revealed that average root mean square error (RMSE) of the state-level estimates of corn and soybean growth stages ranged from 1.10 to 4.20 days and from 3.81 to 7.89 days, respectively, while pixel level estimates had a RMSE ranging from 3.72 to 8.51 days for corn and 4.76-9.51 days for soybean growth stages. Although MODIS 250m based estimates showed similar general spatial patterns observed in the fused MODIS-Landsat based estimates, the accuracy and ability to capture field scale variations was improved with fused MODIS-Landsat data. Overall, results showed the ability of PhenoCrop framework to provide reliable estimates of crop growth stages that can be highly useful in crop modeling and crop management during the growing season.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery for Agronomic and Quality Variability Assessment of Pistachio (<i>Pistacia vera</i> L.)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate the agronomic, phenological, nutritional quality and organoleptic characteristics of pistachios (Pistacia vera L.) based on the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculated in the phenological stage of nut filling from Sentinel satellite imagery. Based on this index, three pistachio tree orchards were studied and classified into two levels of vigour: high and low. The results obtained have discriminated the production per tree, which is strongly related to yield. Regarding the nutritional quality parameters, significant differences were not observed between vigour levels, although the most vigorous trees have shown nuts with a higher percentage of fibre and protein. In terms of phenology, there have not been differences between trees of different vigour, only a slight advance of some phenological stages has been observed in several high-vigour trees. Triangular tests have been made successfully to discriminate the origin of the dry nut and the vigour of the trees. In conclusion, for a given nut quality within a given orchard, the NDVI is a good index to classify different areas according to productive capacity and can be useful to apply variable management, irrigation and fertilization according to vigour.

TI  - Monitoring Wildfires in the Northeastern Peruvian Amazon Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Imagery in the GEE Platform
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - During the latest decades, the Amazon has experienced a great loss of vegetation cover, in many cases as a direct consequence of wildfires, which became a problem at local, national, and global scales, leading to economic, social, and environmental impacts. Hence, this study is committed to developing a routine for monitoring fires in the vegetation cover relying on recent multitemporal data (2017-2019) of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery using the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. In order to assess the burnt areas (BA), spectral indices were employed, such as the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), and Mid-Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI). All these indices were applied for BA assessment according to appropriate thresholds. Additionally, to reduce confusion between burnt areas and other land cover classes, further indices were used, like those considering the temporal differences between pre and post-fire conditions: differential Mid-Infrared Burn Index (dMIRBI), differential Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), differential Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (dNBR2), and differential Near-Infrared (dNIR). The calculated BA by Sentinel-2 was larger during the three-year investigation span (16.55, 78.50, and 67.19 km(2)) and of greater detail (detected small areas) than the BA extracted by Landsat-8 (16.39, 6.24, and 32.93 km(2)). The routine for monitoring wildfires presented in this work is based on a sequence of decision rules. This enables the detection and monitoring of burnt vegetation cover and has been originally applied to an experiment in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon. The results obtained by the two satellites imagery are compared in terms of accuracy metrics and level of detail (size of BA patches). The accuracy for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in 2017, 2018, and 2019 varied from 82.7-91.4% to 94.5-98.5%, respectively.

TI  - Forecasting vegetation condition for drought early warning systems in pastoral communities in Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are a recurring hazard in sub-Saharan Africa, that can wreak huge socioeconomic costs. Acting early based on alerts provided by early warning systems (EWS) can potentially provide substantial mitigation, reducing the financial and human cost. However, existing EWS tend only to monitor current, rather than forecast future, environmental and socioeconomic indicators of drought, and hence are not always sufficiently timely to be effective in practice. Here we present a novel method for forecasting satellite-based indicators of vegetation condition. Specifically, we focused on the 3-month Vegetation Condition Index (VCI3M) over pastoral livelihood zones in Kenya, which is the indicator used by the Kenyan National Drought Management Authority (NDMA). Using data from MODIS and Landsat, we apply linear autoregression and Gaussian process modelling methods and demonstrate high forecasting skill several weeks ahead. As a bench mark we predicted the drought alert marker used by NDMA (VCI3M < 35). Both of our models were able to predict this alert marker four weeks ahead with a hit rate of around 89% and a false alarm rate of around 4%, or 81% and 6% respectively six weeks ahead. The methods developed here can thus identify a deteriorating vegetation condition well and sufficiently in advance to help disaster risk managers act early to support vulnerable communities and limit the impact of a drought hazard.

TI  - THE OTHER'S (DE)COLONIZATION: RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE AND ITS INTERPELLATION ON JHON ALLEN CHAU'S SUBJECT REGARDING THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE NORTH SENTINEL ISLAND
T2  - HUMANIDADES & INOVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper tries to understand how the power mechanisms, sustained by the Protestant religion, singularly reach and systematize the production and reproduction of subjectivities in each subject. In November 28, 2018, a religious activist called John Allen Chau (JAC) was killed while trying to catechize the isolated natives in the North Sentinel Island, India. Such occurrence allowed us to analyze the sense effect of the religious discourse between the subject-position in JAC and the Sentinelese's non-religious subject-position. The discursive materiality consists of excerpts registered by John Allen Chau in the ship's log and later published in The Washington Post, BBC News, and Instagram.

TI  - Four Decades of Land-Cover Change on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska: Detecting Disturbance-Influenced Vegetation Shifts Using Landsat Legacy Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Across Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, disturbance events have removed large areas of forest over the last half century. Simultaneously, succession and landscape evolution have facilitated forest regrowth and expansion. Detecting forest loss within known pulse disturbance events is often straightforward given that reduction in tree cover is a readily detectable and measurable land-cover change. Land-cover change is more difficult to quantify when disturbance events are unknown, remote, or environmental response is slow in relation to human observation. While disturbance events and related land-cover change are relatively instant, assessing patterns of post-disturbance succession requires long term monitoring. Here, we describe a method for classifying land cover and quantifying land-cover change over time, using Landsat legacy imagery for three historical eras on the western Kenai Peninsula: 1973-2002, 2002-2017, and 1973-2017. Scenes from numerous Landsat sensors, including summer and winter seasons, were acquired between 1973 and 2017 and used to classify vegetation cover using a random forest classifier. Land-cover type was summarized by era and combined to produce a dataset capturing spatially explicit land-cover change at a moderate 30-m resolution. Our results document large-scale forest loss across the study area that can be attributed to known disturbance events including beetle kill and wildfire. Despite numerous and extensive disturbances resulting in forest loss, we estimate that the study area has experienced net forest gain over the duration of our study period due to reforestation within large fire events that predate this study. Transition between forest and graminoid non-forest land cover including wetlands and herbaceous uplands is the most common land-cover change-representing recruitment of a graminoid dominated understory following forest loss and the return of forest canopy given sufficient time post-disturbance.

TI  - Analysis of the fragility of the Environmental Protection Area Alto Rio Doce, MG, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the Atlantic Forest is one of the most fragmented biomes. The objective of this study was to diagnose the environmental fragility of Alto Rio Doce Environmental Protection Area(EPA) in Minas Gerais, through characterization of the distribution of local fragmentation, as well as the provision of pressure on vegetation. The vegetation was characterized using a supervised classification of an image captured by the OLI sensor aboard Landsat 8. Only 22.3% of the entire extension of the EPA, which contains 23,329 hectares, has vegetation, which is composed of many small fragments. In addition, the EPA is intersected by roads, one being a state paved road, which accelerates habitat fragmentation, causing damage to both animal and plant species. We conclude that in order to achieve its objectives, the area is in need of a management plan, as well as initiatives to educate the general public about the EPA.

TI  - Explicit Global Simulation of Gravity Waves in the Thermosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new version of the high-resolution Kuhlungsborn Mechanistic general Circulation Model (KMCM) extended to z similar to 450 km. This model is called HIAMCM (HI Altitude Mechanistic general Circulation Model) and explicitly simulates gravity waves (GWs) down to horizontal wavelengths of lambda(h) similar to 165 km. We find predominant tertiary GWs in the winter thermosphere at middle/high latitudes. These GWs typically have horizontal wavelengths lambda(h) similar to 300-1,100 km, ground-based periods similar to 25-90 min, and intrinsic horizontal phase speeds c(Ih) similar to 250-350ms(-1). Above z similar to 200 km, the predominant GW horizontal propagation directions are roughly against the background winds from the diurnal tide; the GWs propagate mainly poleward at midnight, eastward at 6 local time (LT), equatorward at noon, and westward at 18 LT. Wintertime GWs at z similar to 300 km having 165 km <= lambda(h) <= 330 km create a large hot spot over the Southern Andes/Antarctic Peninsula that agrees well with quiet time satellite measurements. Due to cancelation effects, the time-averaged zonal mean Eliassen-Palm flux divergence from the resolved GWs in the thermosphere is negligible compared to that of the tides and compared to the zonal component of the time-averaged zonal mean ion drag. We also find that the thermospheric GWs dissipate mainly from macroturbulent diffusion and, above z similar to 200 km, from molecular diffusion, whereas the tides dissipate mainly from ion drag. The averaged dissipative heating in the thermosphere due to tides is much stronger than that due to GWs.

TI  - Comparative analysis of snowfall accumulation over Antarctica in light of Ice discharge and gravity observations from space
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote and cold Antarctic continent presents unique challenges to quantify precipitation rates from space andin situobservations. This has resulted in large uncertainties in current estimates. In this study, we quantify annual precipitation rates over seven Antarctic basins using a novel mass budget (MB) approach, by building on the recent Landsat based estimate of ice discharge and changes in total water storage from GRACE. The MB precipitation rates are compared with those from CloudSat, GPCP, the Arthern precipitation climatology, the GPM constellation sensors, a few popular reanalysis products, and a regional climate model for two periods: 2007-2010 and 2013-2015. The new estimates are bounded by CloudSat precipitation rates with and without adjustment for the unmeasured near surface precipitation. GPM products significantly underestimate Antarctic precipitation rate, but capture spatial variability that is valuable for bias-adjustment. We find variable performance between products at basin scale, suggesting that an in-depth regional study of precipitation rates is necessary.

TI  - Forest cover change and its driving forces in Fagita Lekoma District, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated forest cover change and the driving forces behind it in Fagita Lekoma District of Ethiopia that resulted in increased forest cover, which might be uncommon outside this case study area. The LULC change analysis was made from 2003 to 2017 based on Landsat images. Socioeconomic analysis was carried out to identify the major driving forces that resulted in LULC change. A questionnaire survey, focused group discussion, key informant interviews and field observation were employed to analyze the link between LULC change and the driving forces. The 15-year period (2003-2017) image analysis revealed that the coverage of forest lands, built-up areas and grassland has increased by 256%, 100% and 96%, respectively, at the expense of cultivated lands and wetlands. The increased forest cover is due to the woodlots expansion ofAcacia decurrensWilld, which are designed for sustainable livelihoods and a land revitalization strategy in the study area. Rapid population growth, an increasing demand for charcoal and subsequent market opportunities, preferred qualities ofA. decurrensor black wattle to halt land degradation as well as to improve land productivity, have been identified as the major driving forces of forest cover change. Chi squared analysis revealed that: a comparative cash income from the sale ofA. decurrens; a dependency on natural forests; the distance from the district administrative center; the size of the active labor force, and the area of land owned have significantly affected the cover change. The major forest cover change is due to the expansion ofA. decurrensplantations that have socioeconomic and environmental implications to improve rural livelihoods and revitalize the land. Thus, the positive experiences identified in this study should be scaled-up and applied in other similar settings.

TI  - Adjuvant and neoadjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer: A literaure review and update on the state of the evidence in 2020
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Radiation therapy has benefited from many developments over the past 20 years. These developments are mainly linked to the technology, imaging and informatics evolutions which allow better targets definitions, ensure better organs -at-risk sparing and excellent reproducibility of treatments, with a perfect control of patient positioning. In breast cancer radiotherapy, the evolution was marked by the possibility of reducing the duration of treatments from 6-7 to 3-4 weeks by using hypofractionated regimens, or by further reducing the irradiation to one week when treatment is solely focalised to the tumour bed. This concept of accelerated partial breast irradiation has challenged the paradigm of the obligation to irradiate the whole breast after conservative surgery in all patients. In addition, the technical mastery of accelerated partial breast irradiation and the development of stereotactic radiotherapy techniques are currently contributing to the development of research projects in neoadjuvant settings. Thus, numerous ongoing studies are evaluating the impact of high-dose preoperative tumour irradiation, alone or in combination with systemic treatments, on biological tumor changes, on anti-tumour immunity, and on the pathologic complete response, which is considered as predictive of better long-term survival in some molecular breast cancer subtypes. In this review, we discuss all these developments which allow breast radiation therapy to enter the era of personalisation of treatments in oncology.

TI  - Blind Unmixing of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data: A New Geometrical Method Based on a Two-Source Sparsity Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Blind source separation (or unmixing) methods process a set of mixed signals, which are typically linear memoryless combinations of source signals, so as to estimate these unknown source signals and/or combination coefficients. These methods have been extensively applied to hyperspectral images in the field of remote sensing, because the reflectance spectrum of each image pixel is often a mixture of elementary contributions, due to the limited spatial resolution of hyperspectral remote sensing sensors. Each spatial source signal then corresponds to a pure material, and its value in each pixel is equal to the "abundance fraction" of the corresponding Earth surface covered by that pure material. The mixing coefficients then form the pure material spectra. Various unmixing methods have been designed for this data model and the majority of them are either geometrical or statistical, or even based on sparse regressions. Various such unmixing techniques mainly consider assumptions that are related to the presence or absence of pure pixels (i.e., pixels which contain only one pure material). The case when, for each pure material, the image includes at least one pixel or zone which only contains that material yielded attractive unmixing methods, but corresponds to a stringent sparsity condition. We here aim at relaxing that condition, by only requesting a few tiny pixel zones to contain two pure materials. The proposed linear and geometrical sparse-based, blind (or unsupervised) unmixing method first automatically detects these zones. Each such zone defines a line in the data representation space. These lines are then estimated and clustered. The pairs of cluster centers, corresponding to lines, which have an intersection, yield the spectra of pure materials, forming the columns of the mixing matrix. Finally, the proposed method derives all abundance fractions, i.e., source signals, by using a least squares method with a non-negativity constraint. This method is applied to realistic synthetic images and is shown to outperform various methods from the literature. Indeed, and for the conducted experiments, when considering the pure material spectra extraction, the obtained improvements, for the considered spectral angle mapper performance criterion, vary between 0.02 degrees and 12.43 degrees. For the abundance fractions estimation, the proposed technique is able to achieve a normalized mean square error lower than 0.01%, while the tested literature methods yield errors greater than 0.1%.

TI  - Microclimate and summer surface activity in the American pika (<i>Ochotona princeps</i>)
T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - As regional climates continue to warm, climate-sensitive species might increasingly depend on microclimates to maintain normal activities. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) has been suggested as a sentinel of montane climate change, largely due to its sensitivity to warm temperatures and high exposure to changing climatic conditions. Pikas use talus to thermoregulate and have been shown to persist more often in talus slopes that create stable microclimates. However, many studies of pika behavior and persistence use metrics of climate measured above the talus surface, outside of the proposed microclimates that pikas can access. We paired fine-scale microclimate measurements with behavioral observations of uniquely tagged pikas in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to model how pikas might use talus subsurface habitat as a microrefuge. Our findings suggest that pikas spend more time on the surface of the talus when there is a stronger gradient in temperatures between "shallow" (0.1 m below the surface) and "deep" (1 m below the surface) regions of the talus, especially during the middle of the day when shallow temperatures are warmer. These results underscore the importance of pairing fine-scale data on microclimate with behavioral observations of tagged individuals to more accurately evaluate how animals might use climate refugia to persist in changing conditions.

TI  - Long-term trends in anthropogenic land use in Siberia and the Russian Far East: a case study synthesis from Landsat
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As globally important forested areas situated in a context of dramatic socio-economic changes, Siberia and the Russian Far East (RFE) are important regions to monitor for anthropogenic land-use trends. Therefore, we compiled decadal Landsat-derived land-cover and land-use data for eight dominantly rural case study sites in these regions and focused on trends associated with settlements, agriculture, logging, and roads 1975-2010. Several key spatial-temporal trends emerged from the integrated landscape-scale analyses. First, road building increased in all case study sites over the 35-year period, despite widespread socio-economic decline post-1990. Second, increase in settlements area was negligible over all sites. Third, increased road building, largely of minor roads, was especially high in more rugged and remote RFE case study sites not associated with greater agriculture extent or settlement densities. High demands for wood export coupled with the expansion of commercial timber harvest leases starting in the mid-1990s are likely among leading reasons for an increase in roads. Fourth, although fire was the dominant disturbance over all sites and dates combined, logging exerted a strong land-use pattern, serving as a reminder that considering local anthropogenic landscapes is important, especially in Siberia and the RFE, which represent almost 10% of the Earth's terrestrial land surface. The paper concludes by identifying remaining research needs regarding anthropogenic land use in the region: more frequent moderate spatial resolution imagery and greater access to more finely resolved statistical and other spatial data will enable further research.

TI  - Phytoplankton-Macrophyte Interaction in the Lagoon of Venice (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The coexistence of phytoplankton and macrophytes in the Lagoon of Venice (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) was investigated using in situ data collected monthly as part of International Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER), together with satellite imagery for the period 1998-2017. The concentrations of chlorophyll a and hydrochemical parameters were measured in three areas of the lagoon, where the expansion of well-developed stands of submerged vegetation was observed by remote sensing. Our results suggest interaction between phytoplankton and macrophytes (macroalgae and seagrasses) in the last few years of the time series, evidenced by decreasing chlorophyll a concentrations in the vicinity of the macrophyte stands. The integration of LTER and remotely sensed data made it possible to evaluate the interaction of macrophytes and phytoplankton at the ecosystem scale for the first time in the Lagoon of Venice.

TI  - Analysis of areas undergoing desertification, using EVI2 multi-temporal data based on MODIS imagery as indicator
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a global problem that impacts a significative part of the Earth's surface, which cause a large environmental and social losses in several regions of the world. The Brazilian semiarid region, located mainly in the northeast part of the country, includes areas of moderate to very high susceptibility to desertification. In order to contribute to a comprehension of the dimensions of desertification in the Brazilian semiarid region, this paper aimed to develop a potential indicator for the evaluation and monitoring of this area, considering an appropriate temporal and spatial scales. For this objective, satellite data were used for the identification and monitoring of sub-areas potentially undergoing degradation/desertification. Thus multitemporal series of Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) covering the period between 2000 and 2016 was used, which were calculated from data provided by the MODIS sensor carried aboard the Terra satellite. Besides, previous samples were selected for the calibration and validation of the methodology. The results show an increase of areas potentially undergoing degradation/desertification, covering an area equal to 167,814.24 km(2) at the end of the period analyzed (around 16.7% of the study area). Approximately 23.63% of the total degraded area comprises both the Very High Degradation Trajectory and High Degradation Trajectory. The proposed methodology contributed to the determination of the degree of the degradation through the determination of Degradation Trajectories, which differentiates it from the ones proposed in other studies; however, it is emphasized that this approach must be analyzed in association with additional information, such as trends and climatic scenarios of land use and land cover, as well as retrospective analyses of the landscape, soil erosion, field recognition, socioeconomic conditions, among others.

TI  - The feasibility of assessing swell-based bathymetry using SAR imagery from orbiting satellites
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing instruments, especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR), have become valuable tools for monitoring coastal bathymetry in both space and time. In this study, we investigate the viability of using data from spaceborne SAR satellites to detect shallow water depths from swell patterns. Using data from four Sentinel-1A SAR images, we employed numerical simulations to quantify the sensitivity of the bathymetry results to different initial input parameters such as wavelength, swell period, and initial water depth. Our sensitivity experiments indicate that the swell period is most sensitive to the water depth, while the initial water depth has the lowest impact on the shallow water depth estimation. Once we quantified the sensitivity of the estimated water depth to these parameters, we calculated the minimum and maximum detectable shallow water depth ranges of six SAR orbiting satellites (L-band: ALOS-2, C-band: GF-3, RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1, X-band: TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed). Because of its single-polarization SAR data, the TerraSAR-X satellite is ultimately the best source of SAR data for swell-based bathymetry analyses. With an incidence angle of 20 degrees and significant wave height of 0.6 m, the TerraSAR-X satellite has the largest theoretical depth detection range (with a minimum detectable depth of less than 2 m, and a maximum detectable depth of more than 200 m) for swell waves with a period of 15 s. The results of this study demonstrate that for low to moderate wave height, satellites with lower slant range to platform velocity ratios (R-RV) can be successfully applied to the task of large-scale bathymetric mapping at shallow depths where there are weak tidal currents or where no recent or accurate ground truth data is available. Based on these results, we can make recommendations that will enable future users to get reliable, robust bathymetry information from their SAR data sets.

TI  - Philosophy as a Model of Dialogue: The Concept "Death of Father" in the Connotations of the Contemporary Humanities
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The author of the article solves the problem of substantiating the repressive character of the neoliberal sociocultural state of the subject in global multicultural capitalism and forming a dialogical model of philosophy as a positive alternative to alienation and identity crisis. The state of the crisis is designated in the framework of the postmodern discourse as "emptiness", "gaping", "rhizome". The main important methodological guidelines for the study were: Alain Badiou's school of psychic and political economy, the Ljubljana school of post-Lacan analysis of the relationship between the real and the symbolic (Slavoj ZiZek, Mladen Dolar), Jean Baudrillard's and Benno Htibner's social phenomenology and aesthetics. The author analyzes the contemporary economic, psychoanalytic and aesthetic materials employing the methods of structural psychoanalysis, semiotic analysis, hermeneutic interpretation and philosophical comparative studies. She structures the symbolic order of the hegemony of globalism as a complex formation of three elements: economic (universal market), mental ("Death of Father", or loss of a vertical figure of control and signification), and sensual-aesthetic (transgression of desire, translation of desire into the automatic regime of a "machine", forced aesthetics, pleasure from the Other, etc.). "Death of Father" is defined as a neoliberal crisis of tradition, leading to a new totalitarianism within the framework of globalism due to voluntary self-censorship and digital control. In the course of the analysis of the relationship between the "Father" (tradition) and the "Son" (subject) as figures to which the concepts of "donor" and "recipient" correspond in semiotics, the author comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to return to the "Father" at a new dialectical turn based on the synthesis of traditionalism (diversity) and universalism (unity). The interaction between the subject and tradition is seen as a process of deliberate fusion of lacks in the philosophy of dialogue. Dialogue appears as the identification of a subject with a symptom (community with the mortality of the Other) outside the chain of signifiers. The tradition presented in the concept "Return of Father" is seen as a lack, symptom, solidarity ("Son") experienced individually as a poetic myth and critically rethought collectively as a principle of social community. Philosophy as a dialogue is a worldview context within which ethical and civilizational principles are synthesized on the basis of two procedures of truth: the phenomenological shift of attention from an object to consciousness and the subjective articulation of values in philosophical hermeneutics.

TI  - A Novel Method for River Bank Detection from Landsat Satellite Data: A Case Study in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River bank (RB) erosion is a global issue affecting livelihoods and properties of millions of people. However, it has not received enough attention in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), i.e., the world's third largest delta, compared to salinity intrusion and flooding. There have been several studies examining RB and coastal erosion in the VMD using remotely sensed satellite data, but the applied methodology was not adequately validated. Therefore, we developed a novel SRBED (Spectral RB Erosion Detection) method, in which the M-AMERL (Modified Automated Method for Extracting Rivers and Lakes) is proposed, and a new RB change detection algorithm using Landsat data. The results show that NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) using the M-AMERL algorithm (i.e., NDWIM-AMERL, MNDWIM-AMERL) perform better than other indices. Furthermore, the NDWIM-AMERL; SMA (i.e., NDWIM-AMERL using the SMA (Spectral Mixture Analysis) algorithm) is the best RB extraction method in the VMD. The NDWIM-AMERL; SMA performs better than the MNDWI, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and WNDWI (Weighted Normalized Difference Water Index) indices by 35-41%, 70% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the NDVI index is not recommended for assessing RB changes in the delta. Applying the developed SRBED method and RB change detection algorithm, we estimated a net erosion area of the RB of -1.5 km(2) from 2008 to 2014 in the Tien River from Tan Chau to My Thuan, with a mean erosion width of -2.64 m and maximum erosion widths exceeding 60 m in places. Our advanced method can be applied in other river deltas having similar characteristics, and the results from our study are helpful in future studies in the VMD.

TI  - A Multi Sensor Approach to Forest Type Mapping for Advancing Monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in Myanmar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forests is important for measuring overall success of the 2030 Agenda because forests play an essential role in meeting many Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially SDG 15. Our study evaluates the contribution of three satellite data sources (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1) for mapping diverse forest types in Myanmar. This assessment is especially important because Myanmar is currently revising its classification system for forests and it is critical that these new forest types can be accurately mapped and monitored over time using satellite imagery. Our results show that using a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 yields the highest accuracy (89.6% +/- 0.16 percentage point(pp)), followed by Sentinel-2 alone (87.97% +/- 0.11 pp) and Landsat-8 (82.68% +/- 0.13 pp). The higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 Blue, Green, Red, Narrow Near Infrared and Short Wave Infrared bands enhances accuracy by 4.83% compared to Landsat-8. The addition of the Sentinel-2 Near Infrared and three Vegetation Red Edge bands further improve accuracy by 0.46% compared to using only Sentinel-2 Blue, Green, Red, Narrow Near Infrared and Short Wave Infrared bands. Adding the radar information from Sentinel-1 further increases the accuracy by 1.63%. We were able to map the two major forest types, Upper Moist and Upper Dry Mixed Deciduous Forest, which comprise 90% of our study area. Accuracies for these forest types ranged from 77 to 96% depending on the sensors used, demonstrating the feasibility of using satellite data to map forest categories from a newly revised classification system. Our results advance the ongoing development of the National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) by the Myanmar Forest Department and United Nations-Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) and facilitates future monitoring of progress towards the SDGs.

TI  - Nanomaterials and Annelid Immunity: A Comparative Survey to Reveal the Common Stress and Defense Responses of Two Sentinel Species to Nanomaterials in the Environment
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryNanotechnology is a dynamically developing field producing large amounts of nanocompounds that are applied in industry, daily life, and health care. During production, use, and waste these materials could end up in water or soil. Large scale contaminations of our environment are a threat to public health. Pollution can have harmful effects on the immune system, as revealed by numerous studies in humans and other vertebrates. The relative simplicity of invertebrate immune functions offers potentially sensitive and accessible means of monitoring the effects and complex interactions of nanoparticles which ultimately affect host resistance. Among terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates, earthworms and leeches are the "keystone" species to evaluate the health of our ecosystems. In this review we compare the conserved stress and immune responses of these invertebrate model organisms toward nanoparticles. The obtained knowledge provides exciting insights into the conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms of nanomaterial-related toxicity in invertebrates and vertebrates. Understanding the unique characteristics of engineered nanoproducts and their interactions with biological systems in our environment is essential to the safe realization of these materials in novel biomedical applications.Earthworms and leeches are sentinel animals that represent the annelid phylum within terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, respectively. One early stress signal in these organisms is related to innate immunity, but how nanomaterials affect it is poorly characterized. In this survey, we compare the latest literature on earthworm and leeches with examples of their molecular/cellular responses to inorganic (silver nanoparticles) and organic (carbon nanotubes) nanomaterials. A special focus is placed on the role of annelid immunocytes in the evolutionarily conserved antioxidant and immune mechanisms and protein corona formation and probable endocytosis pathways involved in nanomaterial uptake. Our summary helps to realize why these environmental sentinels are beneficial to study the potential detrimental effects of nanomaterials.

TI  - Adjustments to SIF Aid the Interpretation of Drought Responses at the Caatinga of Northeast Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) relates directly to photosynthesis yield and stress but there are still uncertainties in its interpretation. Most of these uncertainties concern the influences of the emitting vegetation's structure (e.g., leaf angles, leaf clumping) and biochemistry (e.g., chlorophyll content, other pigments) on the radiative transfer of fluorescent photons. The Caatinga is a large region in northeast Brazil of semiarid climate and heterogeneous vegetation, where such biochemical and structural characteristics can vary greatly even within a single hectare. With this study we aimed to characterize eleven years of SIF seasonal variation from Caatinga vegetation (2007 to 2017) and to study its responses to a major drought in 2012. Orbital SIF data from the instrument GOME-2 was used along with MODIS MAIAC EVI and NDVI. Environmental data included precipitation rate (TRMM), surface temperature (MODIS) and soil moisture (ESA CCI). To support the interpretation of SIF responses we used red and far-red SIF adjusted by the Sun's zenith angle (SIF-SZA) and by daily Photosynthetically Active Radiation (dSIF). Furthermore, we also adjusted SIF through two contrasting formulations using NDVI data as proxy for structure and biochemistry, based on previous leaf-level and landscape level studies: SIF-Yield and SIF-Prod. Data was tested with time-series decomposition, rank correlation, spatial correlation and Linear Mixed Models (LMM). Results show that GOME-2 SIF and adjusted SIF formulations responded consistently to the observed environmental variation and showed a marked decrease in SIF emissions in response to a 2012 drought that was generally larger than the corresponding NDVI and EVI decreases. Drought sensitivity of SIF, as inferred from LMM slopes, was correlated to land cover at different regions of the Caatinga. This is the first study to show correlation between landscape-level SIF and an emergent property of ecosystems (i.e., resilience), showcasing the value of remotely sensed fluorescence for ecological studies.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Water Salinization Stress on Biomass Yield of Cardoon Bio-Energetic Crops through Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Various species of cultivated thistle, such as Cynara cardunculus L. (cardoon), exhibit interesting features for industrial biomass production as bioenergy crops, given also their advantageous adaptation capacities to typical Mediterranean climate trends, with noticeable resilience to drought and salinization stresses. The in situ hyperspectral reflectance responses of three genotypes of cardoon plants, irrigated with water at different salinity levels, have been tested for assessing the effects on their biophysical parameters, aiming at improving the biomass yield for bioenergy production, minimizing at same time the environmental impacts and the exploitation of soils and waters resources. The leaf and canopy reflectance hyperspectral signatures, acquired at three different growth stages with biometric measurements, were statistically analyzed (ANOVA, Tukey's test, graphs), as noise-resilient spectral indices, sensible to different plant features of interest. Their broadband versions, based on the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 MSI satellite sensors, were also evaluated in perspective of operative and extensive remote crop monitoring from space. The results highlighted significant differences in some spectral index responses, related to different cardoon genotypes and water salt concentration. The biometric data supported by red-edge indices modelling evidenced the impact of the highest salt water concentration (200 mM/L) on the plant growth and yield.

TI  - Hybrid Compact Polarimetric SAR for Environmental Monitoring with the RADARSAT Constellation Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Canada's successful space-based earth-observation (EO) radar program has earned widespread and expanding user acceptance following the launch of RADARSAT-1 in 1995. RADARSAT-2, launched in 2007, while providing data continuity for its predecessor's imaging capabilities, added new polarimetric modes. Canada's follow-up program, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), launched in 2019, while providing continuity for its two predecessors, includes an innovative suite of polarimetric modes. In an effort to make polarimetry accessible to a wide range of operational users, RCM uses a new method called hybrid compact polarization (HCP). There are two essential elements to this approach: (1) transmit only one polarization, circular; and (2) receive two orthogonal polarizations, for which RCM uses H and V. This configuration overcomes the conventional dual and full polarimetric system limitations, which are lacking enough polarimetric information and having a small swath width, respectively. Thus, HCP data can be considered as dual-pol data, while the resulting polarimetric classifications of features in an observed scene are of comparable accuracy as those derived from the traditional fully polarimetric (FP) approach. At the same time, RCM's HCP methodology is applicable to all imaging modes, including wide swath and ScanSAR, thus overcoming critical limitations of traditional imaging radar polarimetry for operational use. The primary image data products from an HCP radar are different from those of a traditional polarimetric radar. Because the HCP modes transmit circularly polarized signals, the data processing to extract polarimetric information requires different approaches than those used for conventional linearly polarized polarimetric data. Operational users, as well as researchers and students, are most likely to achieve disappointing results if they work with traditional polarimetric processing tools. New tools are required. Existing tutorials, older seminar notes, and reference papers are not sufficient, and if left unrevised, could succeed in discouraging further use of RCM polarimetric data. This paper is designed to provide an initial response to that need. A systematic review of studies that used HCP SAR data for environmental monitoring is also provided. Based on this review, HCP SAR data have been employed in oil spill monitoring, target detection, sea ice monitoring, agriculture, wetland classification, and other land cover applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation causes diverse and profound consequences for the environment and species. Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Para state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000-2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.

TI  - Land-cover change in the Caucasus Mountains since 1987 based on the topographic correction of multi-temporal Landsat composites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous regions are changing rapidly across the world due to both land-use change and climate change. Given the importance of mountainous regions for ecosystem services and endemic biodiversity, monitoring these changes is essential. Satellite data provide a great resource to map land-cover change in mountainous regions, however mapping is especially challenging there because topographic complexity affects reflectance. The socalled 'topographic effect' has been successfully corrected for in case studies of small areas, but a comparison of large-area classifications and land-cover change analyses with and without topographic correction is missing. Here, we performed a long-term land-cover change assessment for a large mountainous region, i.e., the Caucasus Mountains with topographic correction. Our two goals were 1) to examine the effect of topographic correction on land-cover classification for a large mountainous region, and 2) to assess land-cover changes since 1987 across the Caucasus based on the full Landsat archive. Both the complex topography and the history of land-use changes, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, make the Caucasus Mountains an ideal study area to understand topographic effects on large-area land-cover mapping for the last three decades. First, we compared a non-topographically-corrected Landsat classification for 2015 with a classification that was topographically-corrected with an enhanced C-correction for the same year and assessed the accuracy of both. Second, we derived topographically-corrected Landsat classifications for six dates to assess changes in cropland and forest from 1987 to 2015, based on class probabilities and post-classification comparisons. In regard to our first goal, topographic correction improved the overall accuracy of the classification only by 2% (from 79 to 81%), but disagreement rates were as high as 100% in mountainous regions, especially among forest types. In regard to our second goal, we found that cropland loss was the most prevalent change process since 1987. Cropland loss was particularly widespread in Georgia and Armenia until 2000, and in Azerbaijan until 2005. The North Caucasus (the Russian Federation) had more stable cropland over time, most likely due to different land reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the prevalence of flat landscapes and very fertile soils, which make cultivation easier than in the South Caucasus. Rates of forest change throughout the Caucasus Mountains were surprisingly low, with forest loss and forest gain being roughly equal. Forest loss was most likely related to both illegal logging and natural disturbance, whereas forest gain was most likely due to cropland abandonment and less grazing pressure. Our results highlight both the importance and the feasibility of topographic correction for accurate large-area land-cover classifications in steep terrain.

TI  - A Deep Learning Network to Retrieve Ocean Hydrographic Profiles from Combined Satellite and In Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient combination of remotely-sensed data and in situ measurements is needed to obtain accurate 3D ocean state estimates, representing a fundamental step to describe ocean dynamics and its role in the Earth climate system and marine ecosystems. Observations can either be assimilated in ocean general circulation models or used to feed data-driven reconstructions and diagnostic models. Here we describe an innovative deep learning algorithm that projects sea surface satellite data at depth after training with sparse co-located in situ vertical profiles. The technique is based on a stacked Long Short-Term Memory neural network, coupled to a Monte-Carlo dropout approach, and is applied here to the measurements collected between 2010 and 2018 over the North Atlantic Ocean. The model provides hydrographic vertical profiles and associated uncertainties from corresponding remotely sensed surface estimates, outperforming similar reconstructions from simpler statistical algorithms and feed-forward networks.

TI  - Geosynchronous Satellite GF-4 Observations of Chlorophyll-a Distribution Details in the Bohai Sea, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the distribution of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in the Bohai Sea area based on data from the geosynchronous orbit optical satellite Gaofen-4 (GF-4), which was launched in 2015, carrying a panchromatic multispectral sensor (PMS). This is the first time the geosynchronous orbit optical satellite GF-4 remote-sensing data has been used in China to detect the Chla change details in the Bohai Sea. A new GF-4 retrieved model was established based on the relationship between in situ Chla value and the reflectance combination of 2 and 4 bands, with the R-2 of 0.9685 and the total average relative error of 37.42%. Twenty PMS images obtained from 2017 to 2019 were applied to analyze Chla in Bohai sea. The results show that: (1) the new built Chla inversion model PMS-1 for the GF-4 PMS sensor can extract Chla distribution details in the Bohai Sea well. The high Chla content in the Bohai Sea is mainly located in coastal areas, such as the top of Laizhou Bay, Bohai Bay and Liaodong Bay, with the value being around 13 mu g/L. The concentration of Chla in the Bohai Strait and northern Yellow Sea is relatively low with the value being around 5 mu g/L. (2). Taking full advantage of the continuous observation of geostationary orbit satellite, GF-4 with a high-resolution sensor PMS of 50 m can effectively detect short-term change (changes within 10 min) in Chla concentration. The changes mainly appear at the southwest and northeast costal area as well as in the center of Bohai Sea with the change value of around 3 mu g/L. (3) The change of Chla concentration in the Bohai sea is related to the environmental factors such as seawater temperature, salinity, illumination and nutrient salts, as well as the dynamic factors such as wind, flow field and tidal current.

TI  - Mapping wetland using the object-based stacked generalization method based on multi-temporal optical and SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems have experienced dramatic challenges in the past few decades due to natural and human factors. Wetland maps are essential for the conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems. This study is to obtain an accurate wetland map using an object-based stacked generalization (Stacking) method on the basis of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Robust Adaptive Spatial Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) is used to get time series Sentinel-2 NDVI, from which the vegetation phenology variables are derived by the threshold method. Subsequently, both vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit-horizontal receive (VH) polarization backscatters (sigma 0 VV, sigma 0 VH) are obtained using the time series Sentinel-1 images. Speckle noise inherent in SAR data, resulting in over-segmentation or under-segmentation, can affect image segmentation and degrade the accuracies of wetland classification. Therefore, we segment Sentinel-2 multispectral images to delineate meaningful objects in this study. Then, in order to reduce data redundancy and computation time, we analyze the optimal feature combination using the Sentinel-2 multispectral images, Sentinel-2 NDVI time series, phenological variables and other vegetation index derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral images, as well as time series Sentinel-1 backscatters at the object level. Finally, the stacked generalization algorithm is utilized to extract the wetland information based on the optimal feature combination in the Dongting Lake wetland. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the object-based stacked generalization method are 92.46% and 0.92, which are 3.88% and 0.04 higher than that using the pixel-based method. Moreover, the object-based stacked generalization algorithm is superior to single classifiers in classifying vegetation of high heterogeneity areas.

TI  - Assessing the Operationalization of Cultural Theory through Surveys Investigating the Social Aspects of Climate Change Policy Making
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cultural theory (CT) provides a framework for understanding how social dimensions shape cultural bias and social relations of individuals, including values, view of the natural world, policy preferences, and risk perceptions. The five resulting cultural solidarities are each associated with a "myth of nature''-a concept of nature that aligns with the worldview of each solidarity. When applied to the problem of climate protection policy making, the relationships and beliefs outlined by CT can shed light on how members of the different cultural solidarities perceive their relationship to climate change and associated risk. This can be used to deduce what climate change management policies may be preferred or opposed by each group. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of how CT has been used in surveys of the social aspects of climate change policy making, to assess the construct validity of these studies, and to identify ways for climate change protection policies to leverage the views of each of the cultural solidarities to develop clumsy solutions: policies that incorporate strengths from each of the cultural solidarities' perspectives. Surveys that include measures of at least fatalism, hierarchism, individualism, and egalitarianism and their associated myths of nature as well as measures of climate change risk perceptions and policy preferences have the highest translation and predictive validity. These studies will be useful in helping environmental managers find clumsy solutions and develop resilient policy according to C.S. Holling's adaptive cycle.

TI  - Consecutive Immunohistochemical Staining on a Single Slide is Effective in Confirming Melanocytic Derivation
T2  - APPLIED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR MORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metastatic melanoma in sentinel lymph nodes is often elusive to detect with morphology alone. Per American Joint Committee on Cancer staging guidelines, a single atypical melanocyte in lymph node qualifies as metastasis, whether identified by morphology or immunohistochemistry, but single cell staining must be convincing. We propose that the use of a second immunohistochemical run performed on a single slide will allow for more confident diagnosis of micrometastases. Materials and Methods: We designed a technical study to determine whether a second antibody application on previously stained slides can successfully detect the same population of cells. Melanocytic neoplasms were stained with SOX-10 using Ventana Benchmark Ultra stainers, coverslipped, and examined, followed by coverslip removal and application of MART-1 (Ventana A103). The order of antibody application and chromagen detection kit (AP-RED vs. DAB) was reversed to establish reliability and robustness of the protocol. Results: All melanocytes marked with SOX-10 and MART-1, and produced a range of staining quality that varied based on order of stain application and chromagen kit were used. The optimal combination was red MART-1 applied first followed by brown SOX-10 applied second. Conclusions: Consecutive staining of melanocytes with SOX-10 and MART-1 may improve diagnostic confidence of melanocyte identification, particularly in detection of single cell, micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes or in situations where dual immunohistochemical stains may be unavailable.

TI  - Social network analysis of the Northeast Branch of the Grand Abra River Network Luzon, Philippines, in the nineteenth century
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent works point out the apparent contested subservience (Mawson in Incomplete conquests in the Philippine Archipelago, 1565-1700,2019. 10.17863/CAM.35839) and relative autonomy (Smith in Haven geographies and the indigenous prestige economies of Spanish colonial Philippines,2014) of indigenous Philippine settlements from the Spanish administrators in both the colony and the metropole in contrast to more homogenizing notions that the colonial subjects have become fully assimilated. This case study provides historical geography data that enters this conversation, placing a spotlight on a niche coinciding with the North-eastern branch of the grand Abra River, part of a major gold trading network of Luzon Island in the Philippine archipelago in the nineteenth century, Spanish Contact period. The article explores Social Network Analysis (SNA) on some social and environmental variables of the data. The process included the georeferencing of a nineteenth century archival map of the area in order to digitize relevant settlements in this quadrant of the drainage basin. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) predictive modelling was then undertaken as a preparatory step to SNA analysis. The results indicate that an SNA undertaken using the least cost path predictive models between and among the villages is a good fit to both the environmental as well as the historically documented social relationships of the villages. In terms of the environmental factor, the similarities model seems to reflect intra village connections and relationship that come into play to facilitate trade and exchange. In terms of the social variable the nineteenth century map is quite in tune to the dissimilarities model in terms of showing the degree of integration/assimilation to the Spanish colonial government.

TI  - Genetic investigation of nodal melanocytic nevi in cases of giant congenital melanocytic nevus
T2  - HISTOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nodal melanocytic nevi are common incidental findings in lymph nodes that have been removed during sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma. They can also occur in the local lymph nodes of the giant congenital nevus (GCN), but very little is known regarding nodal melanocytic nevi in the giant congenital nevus, especially at the genetic level. There are two theories that explain the possible pathogenesis of nodal melanocytic nevi, mechanical transport and arrested migration during embryogenesis. However, there have been few tests of these two theories at the molecular biology level until now. We used whole-exon sequencing to test these two theories at the gene level for the first time.In clonal evolution analysis of patient 1, whose tumor mutation burden (TMB) value was relatively stable, showed that the GCN and nodal nevus had the same initial origin and then diverged into two branches as a result of gene mutations. In contrast, analysis indicated that in the other patient, whose TMB value declined from 68.02/Mb in a GCN to 17.55/Mb in associated nodal nevi, these two samples were from different origins at the beginning, each with its own gene mutation. These results are consistent with the two respective theories at the molecular biological level.

TI  - A machine learning approach to estimate chlorophyll-<i>a</i> from Landsat-8 measurements in inland lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) provides an opportunity to map chlorophyll-a (Chla) in lake waters at spatial scales not feasible with ocean color missions. Although state-of-the-art algorithms to estimate Chla in lakes from satellite-borne sensors have improved, there are no robust and reliable algorithms to generate Chla time series from OLI imageries in turbid lakes due to the absence of a red-edge band and issues with atmospheric correction. Here, a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (BST) was employed to develop an algorithm for Chla estimation from OLI in turbid lakes. This model was developed and validated by linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to near-synchronous in situ Chla data available from eight lakes in eastern China (N = 225) and three coastal and inland waters in SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (N = 97). The BST model performed well on a subset of data (N = 102, R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared difference = 7.1 mu g L-1, mean absolute percentage error = 24%, mean absolute error = 1.4, Bias = 0.9), and had better Chla retrievals than several band-ratio algorithms and a random forest approach. The performance of BST model was judged as appropriate only for the range of conditions in the training data. Given these limitations, spatial and temporal variations of Chla in hundreds of lakes larger than 1 km(2) in eastern China for the period of 2013-2018 were mapped using the BST model. OLI-derived Chla indicated that small lakes (<50 km(2)) had greater Chla than the larger lakes. This research suggests that machine-learning models provide practical approaches to estimate Chla in turbid lakes via broadband instruments like OLI and that extending to other regions requires training with a representative dataset.Landsat-8

TI  - Predictive value of the sentinel lymph node procedure in the staging of non-metastatic colorectal cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Despite the recent growing interest of the scientific community, there is still no consensus on the actual applicability and effectiveness of sentinel lymph node (SL) procedure in colon cancers. This study aims to quantify feasibility, detection rate, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the SL identified with fluorescent dye in early colon cancers (ECC). Methods This study conducted a consecutive sampling of 95 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer who have been treated with laparoscopic colon resection and complete mesocolic excision after a 25-mg indocyanine green peritumoral laparoscopic injection and SL identification with a near-infrared camera. The SL was later isolated and sent to ultra-staging. Results Ninety-five patients with an average age of 71 (range 37-90) and a mean BMI of 25 (range 18-39) have been recruited. On the patient sample (92 Pts), an average of 1.49 SL (range 1-5) and a mean time of 4 min were identified. The detection rate was 96.8% and the negative predictive value and accuracy rates were 96.2% and 93.4%, respectively. Conclusions Mapping the SL with fluorescent dye can play an important role in the treatment of colon cancers, particularly those at early stages, and can lead to ultra-conservative surgery.

TI  - Reporting regression in primary cutaneous melanoma. Part 2: prognosis, evaluation and management
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The effect of histological regression on patient prognosis for primary cutaneous melanoma is controversial. Some authors hypothesize that regression indicates a robust systemic immune response and may decrease risk of metastasis. Others argue that histological regression calls into question a T0 diagnosis because there may have been an invasive component of the melanoma that is no longer visible but is still active. The literature to date does not suggest that histological regression is associated with increased risk of positive sentinel lymph node status, metastasis or increased risk of mortality. Thus, the presence of histological regression should not change patient staging, evaluation or management. The criteria used for reporting regression have varied dramatically across studies, and standardized reporting is needed to foster evidence-based practices in the future.

TI  - Landscape evolution of Punta Arena sand spit (SE Baja California Peninsula, NW Mexico): Implications of ENSO on landscape erosion rates
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal bars are deltaic landforms resulting from sediment mobilization from source to sink. The formation, evolution and extinction of coastal bars is of broad interest for Quaternary studies because these are natural archives of former and present climatic conditions where complex ecological and biological relations take place. The Pacific coast of Mexico contains many coastal bars, like the strand-plain of Nayarit (similar to 1400 km(2)) which is one of the largest around the world. We present the first ages of the largest sand spit (similar to 8.5 km(2)) of the SE part of Baja California Peninsula, named Punta Arena. OSL ages indicate that the innermost bar is 0.26 +/- 0.02 ka (1755 +/- 20 AD). Using OSL ages and data obtained from Landsat images we estimate a mean sedimentation rate of ca. 7.7 m yr(-1). Results from satellite images spanning for 32 years (1984 to 2016) confirms that sand spit is accreting at ca. 0.6 m yr(-1) along the bar formation zone and to ca. 0.7m yr(-1) along the longshore drift zone, such rates however, are significantly lower compared other formation periods between 1755 and 1984 CE when sedimentation rates were similar to 8 to similar to 52 m yr(-1). The progradation of the sand spit is consistent with the apparent development and density of vegetation which dramatically drops from inland towards the coast. The analysis of rainfall data spanning from 1950 to 2015 indicates that the largest periods of sedimentation along the sand spit are related with extended non-rainfall months occurring during ENSO conditions. Our data indicate that climate in SE Baja California Peninsula has remained more or less stable since the LIA and the periods of landscape erosion, leading to the formation of bars and sand spit accretion, mainly occur under the warm phase of ENSO (La Nina) which produces extended periods of landscape dryness and intense rainfalls during the winter.

TI  - A spatially explicit surface urban heat island database for the United States: Characterization, uncertainties, and possible applications
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is strongly modulated by urban-scale changes to the aerodynamic, thermal, and radiative properties of the Earth's land surfaces. Interest in this phenomenon, both from the climatological and public health perspectives, has led to hundreds of UHI studies, mostly conducted on a city-by-city basis. These studies, however, do not provide a complete picture of the UHI for administrative units using a consistent methodology. To address this gap, we characterize clear-sky surface UHI (SUHI) intensities for all urbanized areas in the United States using a modified Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) approach by combining a fusion of remotely-sensed data products with multiple US census-defined administrative urban delineations. We find the highest daytime SUHI intensities during summer (1.91 +/- 0.97 degrees C) for 418 of the 497 urbanized areas, while the winter daytime SUHI intensity (0.87 +/- 0.45 degrees C) is the lowest in 439 cases. Since urban vegetation has been frequently cited as an effective way to mitigate UHI, we use NDVI, a satellite-derived proxy for live green vegetation, and US census tract delineations to characterize how vegetation density modulates inter-urban, intra-urban, and inter-seasonal variability in SUHI intensity. In addition, we also explore how elevation and distance from the coast confound SUHI estimates. To further quantify the uncertainties in our estimates, we analyze and discuss some limitations of these satellite-derived products across climate zones, particularly issues with using remotely sensed radiometric temperature and vegetation indices as proxies for urban heat and vegetation cover. We demonstrate an application of this spatially explicit dataset, showing that for the majority of the urbanized areas, SUHI intensity is lower in census tracts with higher median income and higher proportion of white people. Our analysis also suggests that poor and non-white urban residents may suffer the possible adverse effects of summer SUHI without reaping the potential benefits (e.g., warmer temperatures) during winter, though establishing this result requires future research using more comprehensive heat stress metrics. This study develops new methodological advancements to characterize SUHI and its intra-urban variability at levels of aggregation consistent with sources of other socioeconomic information, which can be relevant in future inter-disciplinary research and as a possible screening tool for policy-making. The dataset developed in this study is visualized at: https://datadrivenlab.users.earthengine.app/view/usuhiapp.

TI  - A longitudinal analysis of phenotypic and symptom characteristics associated with inter-individual variability in employment interference in patients with breast cancer
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose A breast cancer diagnosis has a substantial economic impact. Study aims were to evaluate for inter-individual differences in cancer's level of interference with employment and identify phenotypic and symptom characteristics associated with higher levels of interference. Methods Patients (n = 387) were enrolled prior to breast cancer surgery and followed for 12 months. Interference with employment was measured using a 0 (no problem) to 10 (severe problem) numeric rating scale. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to evaluate for inter-individual differences in trajectories of employment interference and characteristics associated with employment interference at enrollment and over 12 months. Results Patients' mean age was 55.0 (+/- 11.7) years and the majority underwent breast conservation surgery (80.6%). Mean employment interference score was 3.2 (+/- 3.7). Unconditional model for employment interference demonstrated a decreasing linear trend (-.076/month). Younger age, lower income, higher pain intensity, and having an axillary lymph node dissection were associated with higher pre-surgical interference scores. Having a sentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with ongoing employment interference scores. Higher sleep disturbance scores were associated with both initial and ongoing employment interference scores. Receipt of chemotherapy, use of complementary or alternative therapies, and re-excision or mastectomy following surgery were significant time varying covariates. Conclusion This study is the first to use HLM to describe inter-individual differences in the trajectories of cancer's interference with employment and associated factors prior to and for 12 months following breast cancer surgery. Patients with the identified risk factors warrant ongoing assessments of employment interference and appropriate referrals.

TI  - Patient-reported Upper Limb Function After Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer: A Prospective Observational Study
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a prospective study that assessed the effect of sentinel node biopsy on upper limb function using the validated quickDASH questionnaire. We found a significant deterioration of upper limb function at 2 weeks post-procedure as compared with preoperative assessment. Upper limb function improved at 3 months but did not reach baseline levels.Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard procedure for axillary staging in breast cancer. There is a lack of consistency in studies reporting on upper limb morbidity after SLNB. We present a prospective study evaluating upper limb function after SLNB using the validated quickDASH questionnaire. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent wide local excision and SLNB were included in the study. Arm function was assessed using the quickDASH questionnaire at 3 time points - prior to surgery and 2 weeks and 3 months after SLNB. The scores obtained were labeled as A, B, and C respectively. The mean and median scores were compared using the paired t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Ninety-nine patients met all inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The mean A, B, and C scores were 8.46, 16.05, and 13.36. The median A, B, and C scores were 2.27, 7.5, and 4.54. There was a statistically significant difference between mean and median A and B scores, B and C scores, and A and C scores. A similar trend was observed in patients with better preoperative upper limb function. Patients with a higher body mass index had significantly worse B and C scores. Conclusion: There is a significant deterioration in upper limb function following SLNB. This improves at 3 months but does not reach baseline levels. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are required to establish the extent of upper limb functional morbidity and natural course of functional recovery after SLNB.

TI  - Estimation of Cadmium Contamination in Different Restoration Scenarios by RUSLE Model
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mae Tao watershed of Thailand faced cadmium (Cd) contamination problems from zinc mining for a long time until the mining area was closed to decrease the level of Cd concentration. This study reproduced the possible scenarios of Cd contamination due to soil loss. Four scenarios of forest restoration were implemented in this study, all of which were calculated with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with satellite imagery and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Landsat 8-OLI was acquired and land use/land cover (LULC) was classified in each scenario. Soil loss maps were created. An inverse distance weighting (IDW) technique was used to estimate the concentration of Cd based on the field data consisting of 101 points of measured Cd concentration. Results from RUSLE model and IDW technique were combined to calculate Cd contamination due to soil loss for all four scenarios. Results showed that the restoration of Scenario 3, forest restoration in old and new mining areas in cooperation with reservoir construction, helped decrease Cd contamination the most. The lowest level of Cd contamination from soil loss was found in this scenario by about 156 ha (total of Cd contamination by 165,924.32 ton/year).

TI  - On the association between lightning and precipitation microphysics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning is one of the most important extreme weather conditions and is associated with heavy convective rain and thunderstorms. However, the present understanding of such systems as well their effect on precipitation characteristics are insufficient for proper modelling. In this paper, the rain microphysics is studied at Kolkata using an optical disdrometer in relation to the lightning activities. Lightning information is obtained from ground based World Wide Lightning Location Network and Lightning Imaging Sensor onboard International Space Station. The associated cloud features are studied with Doppler weather radar and MODIS satellite measurements. Results indicate significant change in rain microphysics between events with lightning and without lightning. The cloud microphysics indicates that the cloud top temperature is lower and cloud effective droplet size is smaller in case of lightning in comparison to non-lightning situation. On the other hand, large drops are abundant while small drops are less in numbers in rain with lightning than rain without lightning. The a value in Z-R relation is found to be significantly higher for rain with lightning than other type. The rain attenuation is also found to have significant variation under these two conditions. The implication of such varied rain microphysics on GPM Ku and Ka band radar are also reported.

TI  - Massive Influx of Pelagic <i>Sargassum</i> spp. on the Coasts of the Mexican Caribbean 2014-2020: Challenges and Opportunities
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Since late 2014, the Mexican Caribbean coast has periodically received massive, atypical influxes of pelagic Sargassum spp. (sargasso). Negative impacts associated with these influxes include mortality of nearshore benthic flora and fauna, beach erosion, pollution, decreasing tourism and high management costs. To understand the dynamics of the sargasso influx, we used Landsat 8 imagery (from 2016 to mid-2020) to record the coverage of sargasso in the sea off the Mexican Caribbean coastline, with a maximum reported in September 2018. Satellite image analysis also showed local differences in the quantity of beached sargasso along the coastline. Over the years, good practice for collection on the beach and for off-shore collection of sargasso have been established through trial and error, and the Mexican Government and hotel industry have spent millions of dollars on removal and off-shore detention of sargasso. Notwithstanding, sargasso also has various properties that could be harnessed in local industries. The stimulation of local industrial growth would offer alternatives to the dependence on tourism, as a circular economy, based on sargasso, is developed.

TI  - Importance of Shaded Leaf Contribution to the Total GPP of Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystems: Evaluation of MODIS GPP
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) quantifies the photosynthetic uptake by vegetation and it is the largest component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. The separation of sunlit and shaded leaves has been shown to be an effective leaf-to-canopy upscaling method for modeling vegetation GPP. In this study, the performance of the Integrated Carbon-Canadian Land Surface Scheme (IC-CLASS) based on Farquhar's photosynthetic model and the two-leaf approach was compared against that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP algorithm using the light use efficiency (LUE) approach, validated with eddy covariance (EC) measured GPP over a variety of terrestrial ecosystems in Canada. There were systematic differences between the IC-CLASS simulated GPP and the MODIS GPP product in spatial distribution patterns. The differences were due to inherent shortcomings of the LUE modeling approach where a constant maximum LUE value is specified for each biome type, ignoring the variation of shaded leaf contribution to total GPP. The IC-CLASS model separates the sunlit and shaded leaves and the bias in simulating GPP was minimized. The IC-CLASS performed better than the MODIS GPP algorithm compared with monthly and annual GPP derived from EC flux data at 13 Canadian Carbon Program sites. The differences between the IC-CLASS and the MODIS GPP estimates were larger in more clumped canopies (i.e. forests), because of the increase in the shaded leaf fraction. Different LUEs in sunlit and shaded portions of the canopy should be considered for effective and reliable estimation of GPP at regional scale.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment and Correction of SRTM DEM Using ICESat/GLAS Data under Data Coregistration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) inherently suffers from various errors. Many previous works employed Geoscience Laser Altimeter System onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/GLAS) data to assess and enhance SRTM DEM accuracy. Nevertheless, data coregistration between the two datasets was commonly neglected in their studies. In this paper, an automated and simple three dimensional (3D) coregistration method (3CM) was introduced to align the 3-arc-second SRTM (SRTM3) DEM and ICESat/GLAS data over Jiangxi province, China. Then, accuracy evaluation of the SRTM3 DEM using ICESat/GLAS data with and without data coregistration was performed on different classes of terrain factors and different land uses, with the purpose of evaluating the importance of data coregistration. Results show that after data coregistration, the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias of the SRTM3 DEM are reduced by 14.4% and 97.1%, respectively. Without data coregistration, terrain aspects with a sine-like shape are strongly related to SRTM3 DEM errors; nevertheless, this relationship disappears after data coregistration. Among the six land uses, SRTM3 DEM produces the lowest accuracy in forest areas. Finally, by incorporating land uses, terrain factors and ICESat/GLAS data into the correction models, the SRTM3 DEM was enhanced using multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), generalized regression NN (GRNN), and random forest (RF), respectively. Results exhibit that the four enhancement models with data coregistration obviously outperform themselves without the coregistration. Among the four models, RF produces the best result, and its RMSE is about 3.1%, 2.7% and 11.3% lower than those of MLR, BPNN, and GRNN, respectively. Moreover, 146 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) points over Ganzhou city of Jiangxi province were used to assess the accuracy of the RF-derived SRTM3 DEM. It is found that the DEM quality is improved and has a similar error magnitude to that relative to the ICESat/GLASS data.

TI  - Analysis on impacts of hydro-climatic changes and human activities on available water changes in Central Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources in Central Asia are very scarce due to natural and anthropogenic impacts. Water shortages have been a major factor hampering the socio-economic development of Central Asia. Exploring internal interactions among climate change, human activities and terrestrial hydrological cycles will help to improve the management of water resources in Central Asia. In this paper, hydro-climatic and anthropogenic data for the period 2003-2016 from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the Global Land Data Assimilation System(GLDAS), the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to analyze the influence of natural factors and human activities on changes of available water (AWC). The terrestrial water storage derived from GRACE and GLDAS remarkably declined in 2008, due to a serious drought, but increased thereafter. The AWC positively responded to the vegetation index, evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration and air temperature at a lag of 0-1 month, but to precipitation at a lag of 2-3 months. Results of correlation analysis with a spatial square moving window indicated that forests, grasses, croplands and water areas presented significantly positive correlations with AWC, while barren areas and urban areas were negatively correlated with AWC. According to the Boruta algorithm and the Random Forest model, natural factors, namely precipitation, evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration, were major factors for AWC in the whole Central Asia. Human activities had direct and indirect impacts on AWC. With the development of society and economy, croplands and urban areas gradually increased, resulting in a rising demand for water withdrawals for agriculture irrigation and industry. The unreasonable utilization and exploitation of water resources led to vegetation degradation and ecosystem deterioration, which would worsen the shortage of water resources in arid regions of Central Asia.

TI  - Open-Surface Water Bodies Dynamics Analysis in the Tarim River Basin (North-Western China), Based on Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tarim River Basin (TRB), located in an arid region, is facing the challenge of increasing water pressure and uncertain impacts of climate change. Many water body identification methods have achieved good results in different application scenarios, but only a few for arid areas. An arid region water detection rule (ARWDR) was proposed by combining vegetation index and water index. Taking computing advantages of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, 56,284 Landsat 5/7/8 optical images in the TRB were used to detect open-surface water bodies and generated a 30-m annual water frequency map from 1992 to 2019. The interannual changes and trends of the water body area were analyzed and the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic drivers on open-surface water body area dynamics were examined. The results show that: (1) ARWDR is suitable for long-term and large-scale water body identification, especially suitable for arid areas lacking vegetation. (2) The permanent water area was 2093.63 km(2) and the seasonal water area was 44,242.80 km(2), accounting for 4.52% and 95.48% of the total open-surface water area of he TRB, respectively. (3) From 1992 to 2019, the permanent and seasonal water bodies of the TRB all showed an increasing trend, with obvious spatial heterogeneity. (4) Among the effects of human activities and climate change, precipitation has the largest impact on the water area, which can explain 65.3% of the change of water body area. Our findings provide valuable information for the entire TRB's open-surface water resources planning and management.

TI  - Augmenting a deep-learning algorithm with canal inspection knowledge for reliable water leak detection from multispectral satellite images
T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintenance planning of groundwater delivery infrastructure, such as canals, requires labor-intensive field inspection for properly allocating maintenance resources to sections of water infrastructure based on their deterioration conditions. Defective canal sections have cracks where the water delivery performance degrades. In practice, canals can be tens or even hundreds of miles long. Manual canal inspections could take weeks, while could hardly achieve comprehensive water leakage assessment. Another difficulty is that most cracks are developing under the water. Without drying up the canals, inspectors could not observe underwater conditions. They would have to assess visible parts of water facilities and environments (e.g., humidity changes and vegetation growths nearby) for prioritizing canal sections in terms of leaking risks. Even experienced inspectors need much time to complete a reliable canal condition assessment.This paper presents a deep-learning approach augmented by canal inspection knowledge to achieve automated and reliable water leak detection of canal sections from Landsat 8 satellite images. Such integration utilizes the domain knowledge of experienced inspectors in augmenting the deep-learning methods for more reliable image pattern classification that supports rapid canal condition assessment. Compared with machine learning algorithms trained by raw satellite images manually labeled as leaking, domain-knowledge-augmented deep learning algorithms use satellite image augmented by pixel-level land surface temperature (LST), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) as training samples. Specifically, LST, FVC, and TVDI for each pixel are physical parameters derived from Landsat 8 satellite images by remote sensing methods. The "leaking" or "no-leaking" labels of the training samples are from the concrete surface inspection records collected during annual dry-ups of the canal from 2016 to 2019. Testing results on data sets collected for canals flowing through both urban and rural areas show that the proposed approach can achieve recall at 86%, precision at 86%, and accuracy at 85%. The precision, recall, and accuracy of the proposed approach are similar to a conventional deep learning algorithm that uses raw images for training while being more computationally efficient. The reason is that the new approach only processes three channels rather than the 11 channels in raw images. The authors also tested how different combinations of environmental features influence the performance of the algorithm. The results showed that two feature combinations: (LST, FVC) and (LST, FVC, TVDI) achieve the most robust performance in diverse geospatial environments.

TI  - Active layer freeze-thaw and water storage dynamics in permafrost environments inferred from InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In cold regions where soils freeze and thaw annually, the ground surface deforms due to the density difference between groundwater and ground ice. Here we mapped thaw subsidence and frost heave signals over the Toolik Lake area on the North Slope of Alaska using 12 ALOS PALSAR Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) scenes (2006-2010). For the first time, we jointly analyzed InSAR observations with a large number of soil measurements collected within similar to 100 km of the Toolik Field Station. We found that the InSAR-observed deformation patterns are mainly related to soil water content and the seasonal active layer freeze-thaw (FT) cycle. We did not observe any substantial long-term subsidence trend outside the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire scar. This suggests that the magnitude of the maximum annual thaw subsidence did not change much outside the fire zone during the study period. The joint analysis of InSAR and field observations allows us to show that the amplitude of the seasonal thaw subsidence is proportional to the total amount of ice that has melted into liquid water at any given time. We note that topography influences the spatial distribution of soil water content, and the availability of soil water influences the type of vegetation that can grow. As a result, we found that the average seasonal thaw subsidence increases along a geomorphic-ecohydrologic transect with heath vegetation on the drier ridge-tops, tussock tundra on hillslopes, and sedge tundra at the wet lowland riparian zones. In addition, we detected a net uplift between late July and early September, mostly in the wetter riparian zone that experienced a larger seasonal thaw subsidence. Toolik Field Station in-situ records suggest that the air temperature fluctuated around or below freezing in early September during the ALOS PALSAR data acquisition times (at similar to 12 am local time). In this scenario, ice can be formed at the top of the soil, which leads to frost heave in saturated soils. Our results highlight how InSAR can improve our understanding of active layer freeze-thaw and water storage dynamics in permafrost environments.

TI  - Does Ecological Water Replenishment Help Prevent a Large Wetland from Further Deterioration? Results from the Zhalong Nature Reserve, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological water replenishment (EWR) has been increasingly applied to the restoration and maintenance of wetland hydrological conditions across China since the beginning of the 21st century. However, little is known about whether EWR projects help protect and/or restore wetland ecohydrology. As one of the earliest and longest-running EWR projects in China, water has been released from the Nenjiang River into the Zhalong wetland since 2001. It is important to examine the ecohydrological effects of this EWR project. In this study, long time series remote sensing data were used to extract the water area, inundation frequency, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to explore how eco-hydrological conditions changed during the pre- (1984-2000) and post-EWR (2001-2018) periods in the Zhalong wetland. Results show that the inundation area decreased due to the reduced surface water inflow during the pre-EWR period. Similarly, monthly vegetation NDVI in the growing season generally exhibited a decreasing and an increasing trend during the pre- and post-EWR periods, respectively. In the post-EWR period, NDVI increased by 19%, 73%, 45%, 28%, 13% for the months of May through September, respectively. Due to EWR, vegetation growth in areas with low inundation frequency was better than in areas with high inundation frequency. We found that the EWR project, runoff, and precipitation contributed 25%, 11%, and 64% to changes in the NDVI, respectively, and 46%, 37%, and 17% to changes in inundation area, respectively. These results indicate that the EWR project has improved hydrological conditions in the Zhalong wetland. For further maximum benefits of EWR in the Zhalong wetlands, we suggest that implementing similar eco-hydrological projects in the future should focus on flood pulse management to increase the inundation area, improve hydrological connectivity, and create new habitats.

TI  - Missing Pixel Reconstruction on Landsat 8 Analysis Ready Data Land Surface Temperature Image Patches Using Source-Augmented Partial Convolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing pixels is a common issue in satellite images. Taking Landsat 8 Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Land Surface Temperature (LST) image as an example, the Source-Augmented Partial Convolution v2 model (SAPC2) is developed to reconstruct missing pixels in the target LST image with the assistance of a collocated complete source image. SAPC2 utilizes the partial convolution enabled U-Net as its framework and accommodates the source into the framework by: (1) performing the shared partial convolution on both the source and the target in encoders; and (2) merging the source and the target by using the partial merge layer to create complete skip connection images for the corresponding decoders. The optimized SAPC2 shows superior performance to four baseline models (i.e., SAPC1, SAPC2-OPC, SAPC2-SC, and STS-CNN) in terms of nine validation metrics. For example, the masked MSE of SAPC2 is 7%, 20%, 44%, and 59% lower than that of the four baseline models. On the six scrutinized cases, the repaired target images generated by SAPC2 have the fewest artifacts near the mask boundary and the best recovery of color scales and fine textures compared with the four baseline models.

TI  - Monitoring early stage invasion of exotic <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> using deep-learning super-resolution techniques based on multisource high-resolution satellite imagery: A case study in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, Spartina alterniflora, one of the top exotic invasive plants in China, has expanded throughout coastal China. In the Yellow River Delta (YRD), the rapid expansion of S. alterniflora has caused serious negative ecological effects. Current studies have concentrated primarily on mapping the distribution of S. alterniflora with medium-resolution satellite imagery at the regional or landscape scale, which have a limited capability in early detection and monitoring of the invasive process at the patch scale. In this study, we proposed a framework for monitoring the early stage invasion of S. alterniflora patches in the YRD using multiyear multisource high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery with various ground sampling distances (WorldView-2, SPOT-6, GaoFen-1, GaoFen-2, and GaoFen-6 from 2012 to 2019). First, we proposed to use deep-learning-based image super-resolution models to enhance all images to submeter (0.5 m) resolution. Then, we adopted stepwise evolution analysis-based image segmentation and object-based classification rules to detect and delineate S. alterniflora patches from the super-resolved imagery. By investigating Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) and Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (FSRCNN) and comparing these methods with the conventional bicubic interpolation method for image resolution enhancement, we concluded that FSRCNN was superior in constructing spectral and structural details from the 1 m/1.5 m/2m resolution images to 0.5 m resolution. FSRCNN, in particular, was more effective and efficient in discerning and estimating the size of small S. alterniflora patches (< 50 m(2)). Using our method, 76 of 83 field-measured small patches were accurately detected and the delineated S. alterniflora patch perimeters agreed well with the field-measured patch perimeters (root mean square error [RMSE] = 8.29 m, mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] = 23.46 %). The invasion process showed fast expansion from 2012 to 2015 and slow growth from 2016 to 2019. We observed that the landward limits of S. alterniflora patches were influenced by elevation and vicinity to tidal creeks.

TI  - Estimation of Winter Wheat Grain Protein Content Based on Multisource Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation is a robust method to predict crop biophysical and biochemical parameters. However, no previous study has attempted to predict grain protein content (GPC) at a regional scale using this method. This study explored the feasibility of designing an assimilation model for wheat GPC estimation using remote sensing, a crop growth model, and a priori knowledge. The data included a field experiment and regional sampling data, and Landsat Operational Land Imager images were employed, with the CERES (Crop Environment REsource Synthesis)-Wheat model used as simulation model. To select an optimal method for data assimilation in GPC prediction, different state variable scenarios and cost function solving algorithm scenarios were compared. Additionally, to determine whether a priori information could improve GPC prediction, the collected leaf area index (LAI) and leaf N content sampling data and the range of GPC in the study region were used to constrain the data assimilation process. Furthermore, the data assimilation method was compared to the use of only the CERES-Wheat model. The results showed that GPC could be predicted by remote sensing observation, a crop growth model, and a priori knowledge at regional scale, where the use of data assimilation improved the GPC prediction compared to using only the CERES-Wheat model.

TI  - Surface soil moisture retrieval using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data in karst rocky desertification area
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is the core component that links the earth's surface water cycle, energy cycle and biogeochemical cycle, and it is also the key parameter to study the ecosystem in karst rocky desertification area. The aim of this study was to retrieve the soil moisture with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data and observation equations were constructed by using the Alpha approximation model over karst rocky desertification area. The spatial and temporal variation characteristics and the error influencing factors of the soil moisture retrieval results were analyzed. It is found that the overall change trend of soil moisture in the observation period is highly consistent with the trend of rainfall change. The maximum value of soil moisture and the degree of spatial heterogeneity in karst rocky desertification area is significantly higher than those in non-rocky desertification area. The results were validated using ground measurements of one acquisition date, with root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0. 059 cm(3)/cm(3) and mean bias value of 0. 026 cm(3)/cm(3). The method of retrieval of soil moisture by Alpha approximate model is applicable to karst rocky desertification area, the mixed pixel problem caused by the surrounding complex habitat conditions of the surface soil is the main influencing factor of inversion error. These results can provide reference to obtaining soil moisture under mountain complex environment by multi-temporal observation method, and provide support for ecosystem restoration and ecological industry development in karst rocky desertification area.

TI  - MYI Floes Identification Based on the Texture and Shape Feature from Dual-Polarized Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northwest Passage (NWP) in the Arctic is usually covered with hazardous multi-year ice (MYI) and seasonal first-year ice (FYI) in winter, with possible thin ice and open-water areas during transition seasons. Ice classification is important for both marine navigation and climate change studies. Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems have shown advantages of retrieving this information. Operational ice mapping relies on visual analysis of SAR images along with ancillary data. However, these maps estimate ice types and concentrations within large-size polygons of a few tens or hundreds of kilometers, which are subjectively identified and selected by analysts. This study aims at developing an automated algorithm to identify individual MYI floes from SAR images then classify the rest of the image as FYI and other ice types. The algorithm identifies the MYI floes using extended-maximum operator, morphological image processing, and a few geometrical features. Classifying the rest of the image uses texture and neural network model. The input data is a set of Sentinel-1 A/B Extended Wide (EW) mode images, acquired between September and March 2016-2019. Although the overall accuracy (for all type classification) from the new method scored 93.26%, the accuracy from using the texture classifier only was 75.81%. The kappa coefficient from the former was higher than the latter by 0.25. Compared with the operational ice charts from the Canadian Ice Service, ice type maps from the new method show better distribution of MYI at the fine scale of individual floes. Comparison against MYI concentration from two automated algorithms that use a combination of coarse-resolution passive and active microwave data also confirms the advantage of resolving MYI floes from the fine-resolution SAR.

TI  - Improving the Classification Accuracy of Annual Crops Using Time Series of Temperature and Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cropland classification is important for agricultural monitoring and related decision-making. The commonly used input spectral features for classification cannot be employed to effectively distinguish crops that have similar spectro-temporal features. This study attempted to improve the classification accuracy of crops using both the thermal feature, i.e., the land surface temperature (LST), and the spectral feature, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), for classification. To amplify the temperature differences between the crops, a temperature index, namely, the modified land surface temperature index (mLSTI) was built using the LST. The mLSTI was calculated by subtracting the average LST of an image from the LST of each pixel. To study the adaptability of the proposed method to different areas, three study areas were selected. A comparison of the classification results obtained using the NDVI time series and NDVI + mLSTI time series showed that for long time series from June to November, the classification accuracy when using the mLSTI and NDVI time series was higher (85.6% for study area 1 in California, 96.3% for area 2 in Kansas, and 91.2% for area 3 in Texas) than that when using the NDVI time series alone (82.0% for area 1, 94.7% for area 2, and 90.9% for area 3); the same was true in most of the cases when using the shorter time series. With the addition of the mLSTI time series, the shorter time series achieved higher classification accuracy, which is beneficial for timely crop identification. The sorghum and soybean crops, which exhibit similar NDVI feature curves in this study, could be better distinguished by adding the mLSTI time series. The results demonstrated that the classification accuracy of crops can be improved by adding mLSTI long time series, particularly for distinguishing crops with similar NDVI characteristics in a given study area.

TI  - <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>-infected sentinel mice: Surveillance and spatial point pattern analysis in Hubei province, China, 2010-2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Progress in national schistosomiasis control in China has successfully reduced disease transmission in many districts. However, a low transmission rate hinders conventional snail surveys in identifying areas at risk. In this study, Schistosoma japonicum-infected sentinel mice surveillance was conducted to identify high-risk areas of schistosomiasis transmission in Hubei province, China.Methods: The risk of schistosomiasis transmission was assessed using sentinel mice monitoring in Hubei province from 2010 to 2018. Field detections were undertaken in June and September, and the sentinel mice were kept for approximately 35 days in a laboratory. They were then dissected to determine whether schistosome infection was present. Ripley's K-function and kernel density estimation were applied to analyze the spatial distribution and positive point pattern of schistosomiasis transmission.Results: In total, 190 sentinel mice surveillance sites were selected to detect areas of schistosomiasis infection from 2010 to 2018, with 29 (15.26%) sites showing infected mice. Of 4723 dissected mice, 256 adult worms were detected in 112 infected mice. The infection rate was 2.37%, with an average of 2.28 worms detected per infected mouse. Significantly more infected mice were detected in the June samples than in the September samples (chi(2) = 12.11, p < 0.01). Ripley's L(d) index analysis showed that, when the distance was <= 34.52 km, the sentinel mice infection pattern showed aggregation, with the strongest aggregation occurring at 7.86 km. Three hotspots were detected using kernel density estimation: at the junction of Jingzhou District, Gong'an County, and Shashi District in Jingzhou City; in Wuhan City at the border of the Huangpi and Dongxihu Districts, and in the Hannan and Caidian Districts.Conclusion: The results showed that sentinel mice surveillance is useful in identifying high-risk areas, and could provide valuable information for schistosomiasis prevention and control, especially concerning areas along the Yangtze River, such as the Fu-Lun, Dongjing-Tongshun, and Juzhang River basins.

TI  - Deep Cross-Modal ImageVoice Retrieval in Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid progress of satellite and aircraft technologies, cross-modal remote sensing imagevoice retrieval has been studied in geography recently. However, there still exist some bottlenecks: how to consider the characteristics of remote sensing data adequately and how to reduce the memory and improve the retrieval efficiency in large-scale remote sensing data. In this article, we propose a novel deep cross-modal remote sensing imagevoice retrieval approach, namely, deep imagevoice retrieval (DIVR), to capture more information of remote sensing data to generate hash codes with low memory and fast retrieval properties. Especially, the DIVR approach proposes inception dilated convolution module to capture multiscale contextual information of remote sensing images and voices. Moreover, in order to enhance cross-modal similarity, the deep features similarity term is designed to make paired similar deep features as close as possible and paired dissimilar deep features as mutually far as possible. In addition, the quantization error term is designed to drive hash-like codes to approximate hash codes, which can effectively reduce the quantization error for hash codes learning. Extensive experimental results on three remote sensing imagevoice data sets show that the proposed DIVR approach can outperform other cross-modal retrieval approaches.

TI  - Assessment of Surface Hydrological Connectivity in an Ungauged Multi-Lake System with a Combined Approach Using Geostatistics and Spaceborne SAR Observations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Connectivity metrics for surface water are important for predicting floods and droughts, and improving water management for human use and ecological integrity at the landscape scale. The integrated use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and geostatistics approach can be useful for developing and quantifying these metrics and their changes, including geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), surface water extent (SWE), and connection frequency. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis based on 52 wet and dry binary state (i.e., water and non-water) rasters derived from Sentinel-1 A/B GRD products acquired from 2015 to 2019 for China's Momoge National Nature Reserve to investigate applicability and dynamics of the hydrologic connectivity metrics in an ungauged (i.e., data such as flow and water level are scarce) multi-lake system. We found: (1) generally, the change of GCF in North-South and Northeast-Southwest directions was greater than that in the West-East and Northwest-Southeast directions; (2) MDC had a threshold effect, generally at most 25 km along the W-E, NW-SE and NE-SW directions, and at most 45 km along the N-S direction; (3) the flow paths between lakes are diverse, including channelized flow, diffusive overbank flow, over-road flow and "fill-and-merge"; (4) generally, the values of the three surface hydrological connectivity indicators (i.e., the MDC, the SWE, and the conneciton frequency) all increased from May to August, and decreased from August to October; (5) generally, the closer the distance between the lakes, the greater the connection frequency, but it is also affected by the dam and road barrier. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the geostatistical method combining Sentinel-1 SAR image analysis in quantifying surface hydrological connectivity in an ungagged area. This approach should be applicable for other geographical regions, in order help resource managers and policymakers identify changes in surface hydrological connectivity, as well as address potential impacts of these changes on water resources for human use and/or ecological integrity at the landscape level.

TI  - The collapse points of increasing trend of vegetation rain-use efficiency under droughts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation rain-use efficiency (RUE) represents the ability of an ecosystem to use rainfall and is an important descriptor of ecological functions of terrestrial system. Although studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of droughts on vegetation, we still lack critical understanding of how exactly RUE responds to droughts of different time scales and intensities. Here, we present evidence for a rapid response in RUE, and collapse points of RUE increase trend during droughts by using multi-source meteorological data and satellite-derived vegetation indices. The highest correlation was found consistently between RUE and computed drought index at time scale of 1 month for all biome types and climate regimes. We further discovered that RUE increased significantly with amplification of drought intensity to a maximum RUE, especially for semi-arid and arid biomes. As drought is prolonged, RUE increased till a tipping point was reached across all biomes and climatic conditions, indicating that the long-term droughts weaken the sensitivities of RUE to drought and threaten the resilience of ecosystem. This study comprehensively provides a satellite-based evaluation of RUE response to different drought features. We envisage that the findings would contribute to the development of drought early warning from an ecological perspective and to provide the sustainable environmental management.

TI  - The Influence of CLBP Window Size on Urban Vegetation Type Classification Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban vegetation can regulate ecological balance, reduce the influence of urban heat islands, and improve human beings' mental state. Accordingly, classification of urban vegetation types plays a significant role in urban vegetation research. This paper presents various window sizes of completed local binary pattern (CLBP) texture features classifying urban vegetation based on high spatial-resolution WorldView-2 images in areas of Shanghai (China) and Lianyungang (Jiangsu province, China). To demonstrate the stability and universality of different CLBP window textures, two study areas were selected. Using spectral information alone and spectral information combined with texture information, imagery is classified using random forest (RF) method based on vegetation type, showing that use of spectral information with CLBP window textures can achieve 7.28% greater accuracy than use of only spectral information for urban vegetation type classification, with accuracy greater for single vegetation types than for mixed ones. Optimal window sizes of CLBP textures for grass, shrub, arbor, shrub-grass, arbor-grass, and arbor-shrub-grass are 3 x 3, 3 x 3, 11 x 11, 9 x 9, 9 x 9, 7 x 7 for urban vegetation type classification. Furthermore, optimal CLBP window size is determined by the roughness of vegetation texture.

TI  - Phenology of short vegetation cycles in a Kenyan rangeland from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The short revisit times afforded by recently-deployed optical satellite sensors that acquire 3-30 m resolution imagery provide new opportunities to study seasonal vegetation dynamics. Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km(2) Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start and end-of-season for the series using a 50% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of similar to 8 days for SOS50 and similar to 15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.

AB  - History A 70-year-old man had a posterior left thigh lesion confirmed to be biopsy-proven melanoma. The patient underwent wide excision and sentinel node biopsy, which showed absence of residual melanoma. Two years later, the patient noticed a subcentimeter subcutaneous lump in his thigh. Repeat excisional biopsy showed involvement of the surrounding soft tissue, consistent with a satellite lesion. Follow-up combined PET/CT revealed satellite nodules around the primary lesion, enabling confirmation of subcutaneous metastatic disease.The patient was subsequently started on nivolumab, an antiprogrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks PD-1 and is approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. On the baseline scan prior to starting nivolumab, there were no CT findings that suggested metastatic disease, nor were there enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Five months after initiation of nivolumab treatment, the first follow-up chest CT scan was performed and showed new findings in the mediastinum (Fig 1) and bilateral lungs (Figs 2, 3). The patient remained asymptomatic during the treatment period. Furthermore, the subcutaneous metastatic disease remained stable during the treatment period, and no other site of metastatic disease was noted on follow-up CT scans obtained during the first 5 months of treatment.The patient had no prior history of infectious or occupational exposures. During the nivolumab treatment cycle, his pertinent laboratory values and physical examination findings were unremarkable.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of the seasonal and inter-annual pan inundation dynamics in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Southern Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid regions, pans form a critical water source that supports local communities, livestock, and wildlife, with readily available water resources. However, these waterbodies are unevenly distributed across the landscape and highly ephemeral and this influences their ability to provide water, especially in remote and water scarce areas. In addition, it remains difficult, impractical, and costly to monitor their variability using traditional hydrometric networks. In this regard, their contribution as water sources remains uncertain. The availability of spatially explicit data, with improved sensor design characteristics such as Landsat-8 enables the monitoring of their surface water extent over space and time. This study therefore, for the first time investigated the potential of using Landsat-8 in detecting and monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of pan inundation in the water scarce region of Kgalagadi in Southern Africa between 2016 and 2018. This was achieved by testing the performance of multiple indices, namely; the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index for Shadow (AWEIsh), Water Ratio Index (WRI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Overall, the results have shown the potential of remote sensing data to monitor pan inundation. The MNDWI produced the highest overall classification accuracy of 84.91% comparatively. The MNDWI was then used for monitoring and assessing pan inundation dynamics over different seasons between 2016 and 2018. During the study period, pan inundation varied significantly (alpha = 0.05) for different seasons. Nevertheless, 2017 had the largest surface water extent covering 23 195.8 m(2), during the wet season and 17 913.3 m(2) in the dry season. On the other hand, 2018 showed the smallest spatial coverage of 13 076 m(2) for the wet season and 6032.587 m(2) during the dry season. The observed spatial variability in pan inundation was attributed to rainfall and temperature variability. The study thus revealed the utility of remotely sensed data sets in providing a more robust approach for monitoring seasonal and inter-annual pan inundation variations in semi-arid environments of Southern Africa. This information is important for water management decision making, specifically for water-limited areas, to conserve these water sources to ensure their sustainability in supporting local communities, livestock and wildlife population.

TI  - Activation of ocular surface mast cells promotes corneal neovascularization
T2  - OCULAR SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Mast cells, historically known for their effector function in the induction of allergic diseases, reside in all vascularized tissues of the body in particular proximity to blood and lymphatic vessels. As neighboring sentinel cells to blood vessels, mast cells have been associated with angiogenesis. Here we assess the direct contribution of mast cells to neovascularization at the ocular surface.Methods: Corneal neovascularization was induced by placing a single figure-of-eight intrastromal suture 1 mm from the limbus in mast cell-deficient (cKit(W-sh)), C57BL/6, and Balb/c mice. Corneas were harvested at 6 h post-suture to quantify cKit(+)Fc epsilon R1(+) mast cells using flow cytometry and tear wash was collected within 6 h to measure beta-hexosaminidase and tryptase. Neovascularization was assessed using slit-lamp biomicroscope and immunohistochemistry analysis of corneas harvested on day 4 post-suture. To investigate the effects of mast cells on blood vessel growth, mast cells were co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells (VECs), and tube formation and proliferation of VECs were measured. 2% cromolyn was administered locally to inhibit mast cell activation in vivo.Results: Placement of corneal suture activates ocular surface mast cells, which infiltrate into the cornea adjacent to new vessels. Mast cell-deficient mice develop significantly fewer new vessels following suture placement. Mast cells directly promote VEC proliferation and tube formation, partly through secreting high levels of VEGF-A. Pharmacological inhibition of mast cell activation results in significantly less corneal neovascularization.Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ocular surface mast cells are critical to corneal neovascularization, suggesting mast cells as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of corneal neovascularization.

TI  - Monitoring Ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations Based on a Stacking Ensemble Approach Using Satellite Data and Numerical Models
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is primarily released through industrial, residential, and transportation activities, and creates secondary air pollutants through chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Long-term exposure to SO2 can result in a negative effect on the human body causing respiratory or cardiovascular disease, which makes the effective and continuous monitoring of SO2 crucial. In South Korea, SO2 monitoring at ground stations has been performed, but this does not provide spatially continuous information of SO2 concentrations. Thus, this research estimated spatially continuous ground-level SO2 concentrations at 1 km resolution over South Korea through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical models. A stacking ensemble approach, fusing multiple machine learning algorithms at two levels (i.e., base and meta), was adopted for ground-level SO2 estimation using data from January 2015 to April 2019. Random forest and extreme gradient boosting were used as based models and multiple linear regression was adopted for the meta-model. The cross-validation results showed that the metamodel produced the improved performance by 25% compared to the base models, resulting in the correlation coefficient of 0.48 and root-mean-square-error of 0.0032 ppm. In addition, the temporal transferability of the approach was evaluated for one-year data which were not used in the model development. The spatial distribution of ground-level SO2 concentrations based on the proposed model agreed with the general seasonality of SO2 and the temporal patterns of emission sources.

TI  - Development of a cloud-screening algorithm for direct and diffuse AODs from the Skyradiometer Network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a cloud-screening algorithm for direct and diffuse aerosol optical depths (AODs) from the Skyradiometer Network (CSDD). Variabilities of direct AODs were checked not only to screen cloud-contaminated (cloudy) data effectively but also to make direct AODs available for aerosol study, as in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). Skyradiometer data were used from the Seoul National University (SNU) site for three years from 2012 to 2014. CSDD tested the spectral and temporal variabilities according to the Angstrom exponent at the first stage, and the temporal smoothness in the form of the coefficient of variation at the second stage. The algorithm for CSDD was constructed to minimize the differences with optical properties of cloudy data (and clear-sky data as well) based on the cloud cover from the synoptic station. A number of cloudy data that was not screened by the previous algorithms was removed, and the absolute value of the bias total could be substantially lowered. The performances of algorithms for cloud detection were also examined using lidar observations at the study site in terms of accuracy, probability of detection (POD), and false detection rate. The statistics of cloud detection for CSDD were generally comparable to those of AERONET for direct data, and the POD for diffuse data was improved to the level of direct data.

TI  - Cardiac Tamponade.
T2  - Journal of education & teaching in emergency medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Audience: This simulation is designed to educate emergency medicine residents and medical students on the recognition and management of cardiac tamponade, as well as encourage providers to become familiar with their states' disclosure laws for sentinel events.Introduction: Cardiac tamponade is an emergent condition in which the accumulation of pericardial fluid and the consequent increase in hydrostatic pressure becomes severe enough to compromise the normal diastolic and systolic function of the heart, resulting in hemodynamic instability.1 The causes of cardiac tamponade are numerous because it is a potential complication of any of a number of pericardial disease processes, including infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, and malignant etiologies.1,2 Clinical presentations may vary and symptoms can be non-specific, which can lead to delayed or missed diagnoses and poor patient outcomes.3 In addition to this, the incidence of this condition is rising due to the increasing frequency of cardiac procedures performed (ie, pacemaker placement).4 Therefore, it is important for medical providers to have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis based on patient presentation and to quickly provide necessary treatment to stabilize the patient.Educational Objectives: By the end of this simulation session, the learner will be able to: (1) describe a diagnostic differential for dizziness (2) describe the pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade (3) describe the acute management of cardiac tamponade, including fluid bolus and pericardiocentesis (4) describe the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings of pericardial effusion (5) describe the ultrasound findings of cardiac tamponade (6) describe the indications for emergent bedside pericardiocentesis versus medical stabilization and delayed pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade (7) describe the procedural steps for pericardiocentesis, and (8) describe your state's laws regarding disclosure for sentinel events.Educational Methods: This session is conducted using high-fidelity simulation, followed by a debriefing session on evaluation and treatment of cardiac tamponade. However, it may also be run as an oral board case.Educational Methods: Our residents were provided an electronic survey at the completion of the debriefing session so they may rate different aspects of the simulation, as well as provide qualitative feedback on the scenario. This survey is specific to the local institution's simulation center.Results: Feedback was largely positive because many learners mentioned during debriefing that they are not comfortable with pericardiocentesis and have limited opportunities to practice the procedure. None of our residents were familiar with our state's or institution's disclosure laws for sentinel events.The local institution's simulation center feedback form is based on the Center of Medical Simulation's Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare (DASH) Student Version Short Form with the inclusion of required qualitative feedback if an element was scored less than a 6 or 7.5 This session received a majority of 6 (consistently effective/very good) and 7 scores (extremely effective/outstanding).Discussion: This is a potential method for educating future medical providers on the diagnosis and management of cardiac tamponade in an emergency department setting. Learners initially had a wide range of differentials for the chief complaint of dizziness. We used an ECG with low voltage but without electrical alternans. When asked to provide an ECG interpretation, low voltage was intermittently explicitly interpreted by learners. We were concerned that if we showed an ECG with electrical alternans, learners may quickly arrive at the diagnosis without focusing on the subtleties of a physical exam, including looking for jugular venous distention (JVD) or pulsus paradoxus.We did not have the patient decompensate if their international normalized ratio (INR) was not immediately reversed, given likely delay for in vivo coagulation to occur in the face of life-threatening tamponade, but this provided a robust discussion during debriefing if reversal should be emergently initiated.Many residents voiced that they were uncomfortable performing a pericardiocentesis because they only had a few opportunities to do so on human cadavers, and they appreciated the opportunity to review this.Unexpectedly, when the patient asked the learners if he should sue the cardiologist, the majority of groups told the patient that the cardiologist was not liable because tamponade is a known complication of cardiac ablation and likely reviewed this while obtaining informed consent. None of the learners were familiar with Ohio's disclosure laws for sentinel events. This identified a gap in knowledge that may be addressed in future learning sessions.Our main take-away is to continue providing low-frequency, high-acuity cases that provide the opportunity to review infrequent pathologies and procedures, as well as including patient safety and administrative learning points.Topics: Medical simulation, cardiac tamponade, pericardial effusion, cardiac emergencies, obstructive shock, sentinel events, iatrogenic injury, medical disclosure.

TI  - Correlation Analysis between Air Temperature and MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Prediction of Air Temperature Using TensorFlow Long Short-Term Memory for the Period of Occurrence of Cold and Heat Waves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between surface air temperature (SAT) and land surface temperature (LST) based on land use when heat and cold waves occur and to predict the distribution of SAT using the long short-term memory (LSTM) of TensorFlow. For the correlation analysis, the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime and nighttime LST and maximum, minimum, and mean SAT were measured at 79 weather stations of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2008 to 2018. As a result of the correlation analysis between SAT and LST, the maximum SAT (T-MX) had a good correlation with the daytime LST of Terra MODIS, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.8 degrees C, and the minimum SAT (T-MN) showed a good correlation with the nighttime LST of Terra MODIS, with an R of 0.93 and RMSE of 4.2 degrees C. When analyzing temperature characteristics by land use (urban, paddy, upland crop, forest, grass, wetland, bare field, and water), it was confirmed that the climate mitigation effect of the wetland and vegetation area appeared in the LSTs and the observed SAT. In the cold wave period, the average temperatures for urban and wetland areas was the highest, and the average temperature for wetland and forest was not higher than that of other land use classes. As the SAT results predicted through the LSTM model, the accuracy of the T-MN during the cold wave period was 0.59 for the coefficient of determination (R-2), 3.1 degrees C for RMSE, and 0.76 for the index of agreement (IoA), while the accuracy of the T-MX for the heat wave period was 0.24 for R-2, 2.23 degrees C for RMSE, and 0.63 for IoA.

TI  - A New Remote Sensing Method to Estimate River to Ocean DOC Flux in Peatland Dominated Sarawak Coastal Regions, Borneo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new remote sensing based method to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux discharged from rivers into coastal waters off the Sarawak region in Borneo. This method comprises three steps. In the first step, we developed an algorithm for estimating DOC concentrations using the ratio of Landsat-8 Red to Green bands B4/B3 (DOC (mu M C) = 89.86 center dot e(0.27 center dot(B4/B3))), which showed good correlation (R = 0.88) and low mean relative error (+5.71%) between measured and predicted DOC. In the second step, we used TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation data to estimate river discharge for the river basins. In the final step, DOC flux for each river catchment was then estimated by combining Landsat-8 derived DOC concentrations and TMPA derived river discharge. The analysis of remote sensing derived DOC flux (April 2013 to December 2018) shows that Sarawak coastal waters off the Rajang river basin, received the highest DOC flux (72% of total) with an average of 168 Gg C per year in our study area, has seasonal variability. The whole of Sarawak represents about 0.1% of the global annual riverine and estuarine DOC flux. The results presented in this study demonstrate the ability to estimate DOC flux using satellite remotely sensed observations.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach to the Detection of Gossans in the Canadian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gossans are surficial deposits that form in host bedrock by the alteration of sulphides by acidic and oxidizing fluids. These deposits are typically a few meters to kilometers in size and they constitute important vectors to buried ore deposits. Hundreds of gossans have been mapped by field geologists in sparsely vegetated areas of the Canadian Arctic. However, due to Canada's vast northern landmass, it is highly probable that many existing occurrences have been missed. In contrast, a variety of remote sensing data has been acquired in recent years, allowing for a broader survey of gossans from orbit. These include band ratioing or methods based on principal component analysis. Spectrally, the 809 gossans used in this study show no significant difference from randomly placed points on the Landsat 8 imageries. To overcome this major issue, we propose a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks and relying on geo big data (Landsat-8, Arctic digital elevation model lithological maps) that can be used for the detection of gossans. Its application in different regions in the Canadian Arctic shows great promise, with precisions reaching 77%. This first order approach could provide a useful precursor tool to identify gossans prior to more detailed surveys using hyperspectral imaging.

TI  - Computational modeling of extreme wildland fire events: A synthesis of scientific understanding with applications to forecasting, land management, and firefighter safety
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding and prediction of large wildland fire events around the world is a growing interdisciplinary research area advanced rapidly by development and use of computational models. Recent models bidirectionally couple computational fluid dynamics models including weather prediction models with modules containing algorithms representing fire spread and heat release, simulating fire-atmosphere interactions across scales spanning three orders of magnitude. Integrated with weather data and airborne and satellite remote sensing data on wildland fuels and active fire detection, modern coupled weather-fire modeling systems are being used to solve current science problems. Compared to legacy tools, these dynamic computational modeling systems increase cost and complexity but have produced breakthrough insights notably into the mechanisms underlying extreme wildfire events such as fine-scale extreme winds associated with interruptions of the electricity grid and have been configured to forecast a fire's growth, expanding our ability to anticipate how they will unfold. We synthesize case studies of recent extreme events, expanding applications, and the challenges and limitations in our remote sensing systems, fire prediction tools, and meteorological models that add to wildfires' mystery and apparent unpredictability.

TI  - Retrieving the National Main Commodity Maps in Indonesia Based on High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Data Using Cloud Computing Platform
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the most favorable climates for agriculture because of its location in the tropical climatic zones. The country has several commodities to support economics growth that are driven by key export commodities-e.g., oil palm, rubber, paddy, cacao, and coffee. Thus, identifying the main commodities in Indonesia using spatially-explicit tools is essential to understand the precise productivity derived from the agricultural sectors. Many previous studies have used predictions developed using binary maps of general crop cover. Here, we present national commodity maps for Indonesia based on remote sensing data using Google Earth Engine. We evaluated a machine learning algorithm-i.e., Random Forest to parameterize how the area in commodity varied in Indonesia. We used various predictors to estimate the productivity of various commodities based on multispectral satellite imageries (36 predictors) at 30-meters spatial resolution. The national commodity map has a relatively high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of about 95% and Kappa coefficient of about 0.90. The results suggest that the oil palm plantation was the highest commodity product that occupied the largest land of Indonesia. However, this study also showed that the land area in rubber, rice paddies, and cacao commodities was underestimated due to its lack of training samples. Improvement in training data collection for each commodity should be done to increase the accuracy of the commodity maps. The commodity data can be viewed online (website can be found in the end of conclusions). This data can further provide significant information related to the agricultural sectors to investigate food provisioning, particularly in Indonesia.

TI  - Inferring ground-level nitrogen dioxide concentrations at fine spatial resolution applied to the TROPOMI satellite instrument
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based estimates of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations are useful for understanding links between air quality and health. A longstanding question has been why prior satellite-derived surface NO(2)concentrations are biased low with respect to ground-based measurements. In this work we demonstrate that these biases are due to both the coarse resolution of previous satellite NO(2)products and inaccuracies in vertical mixing assumptions used to convert satellite-observed tropospheric columns to surface concentrations. We develop an algorithm that now allows for different mixing assumptions to be used based on observed NO(2)conditions. We then apply this algorithm to observations from the TROPOMI satellite instrument, which has been providing NO(2)column observations at an unprecedented spatial resolution for over a year. This new product achieves estimates of ground-level NO(2)with greater accuracy and higher resolution compared to previous satellite-based estimates from OMI. These comparisons also show that TROPOMI-inferred surface NO(2)concentrations from our updated algorithm have higher correlation and lower bias than those found using TROPOMI and the prior algorithm. TROPOMI-inferred estimates of the population exposed to NO(2)conditions exceeding health standards are at least three times higher than for OMI-inferred estimates. These developments provide an exciting opportunity for air quality monitoring.

TI  - USING OPTICAL SATELLITE AND AERIAL IMAGERY FOR AUTOMATIC COASTLINE MAPPING
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous availability and rapid accessibility to multispectral data from satellite platforms within the Copernicus Programme represents a great opportunity for users in different fields of applications as: agriculture, observation of coastal zones, monitoring land cover change. The aim of this paper is to identify a suitable method to map coastline using Sentinel-2 optical satellite image. The method provides the use of two indexes developed in remote sensing field for water environment: NDWI (Normalized difference water index) and MNDWI (Modified Normalized difference water index). Starting from the construction of maps of these indexes and, identifying appropriate threshold values, it has been possible to extrapolate the coastline. The coastlines derived from the use of the NDWI and MNDWI index were compared with a coastline obtained from the photointerpretation of a very high resolution orthophoto obtained through photogrammetric techniques. The results show that it is possible to map the coastline automatically and quickly with an intrinsic accuracy close to the geometric resolution bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images.

TI  - Small Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images Based on Super-Resolution with Auxiliary Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article tackles the problem of detecting small objects in satellite or aerial remote sensing images by relying on super-resolution to increase image spatial resolution, thus the size and details of objects to be detected. We show how to improve the super-resolution framework starting from the learning of a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on residual blocks and then its integration into a cycle model. Furthermore, by adding to the framework an auxiliary network tailored for object detection, we considerably improve the learning and the quality of our final super-resolution architecture, and more importantly increase the object detection performance. Besides the improvement dedicated to the network architecture, we also focus on the training of super-resolution on target objects, leading to an object-focused approach. Furthermore, the proposed strategies do not depend on the choice of a baseline super-resolution framework, hence could be adopted for current and future state-of-the-art models. Our experimental study on small vehicle detection in remote sensing data conducted on both aerial and satellite images (i.e., ISPRS Potsdam and xView datasets) confirms the effectiveness of the improved super-resolution methods to assist with the small object detection tasks.

TI  - Completion lymph node dissection for merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is widely used for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), however in SLNB positive MCC the role of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) with or without adjuvant radiation therapy is unclear.Objective: Our goal was to determine the impact of CLND and adjuvant radiation therapy on survival in SLNB positive MCC.Materials and methods: We examined 447 patients with MCC with a positive SLNB in the National Cancer Data Base from 2012 to 2015. We compared patients who underwent CLND versus observation with or without adjuvant radiation.Results: Compared with CLND and adjuvant radiation (reference) treatment with observation (HR 3.54, CI 1.36-9.18) or CLND alone (HR 2.54, CI 1.03-6.27) were associated with worse overall survival after adjusting for clinicopathologic differences. In contrast treatment with adjuvant radiation alone without CLND was not associated with worse overall survival (HR 1.70, CI 0.74-3.92) compared with CLND and adjuvant radiation (reference).Conclusions: In SLNB positive MCC, CLND alone is associated with worse survival compared with treatment with adjuvant radiation or both CLND and adjuvant radiation.

TI  - Intraoperative Sentinel Events in the Era of Surgical Safety Checklists: Results of a National Survey
T2  - OTO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Despite the implementation of advanced health care safety systems including checklists, preventable perioperative sentinel events continue to occur and cause patient harm, disability, and death. We report on findings relating to otolaryngology practices with surgical safety checklists, the scope of intraoperative sentinel events, and institutional and personal response to these events.Study Design. Survey study.Setting. Anonymous online survey of otolaryngologists.Methods. Members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were asked about intraoperative sentinel events, surgical safety checklist practices, fire safety, and the response to patient safety events. Results. In total, 543 otolaryngologists responded to the survey (response rate 4.9% = 543/11,188). The use of surgical safety checklists was reported by 511 (98.6%) respondents. At least 1 patient safety event in the past 10 years was reported by 131 (25.2%) respondents; medication errors were the most commonly reported (66 [12.7%] respondents). Wrong site/patient/procedure events were reported by 38 (7.3%) respondents, retained surgical items by 33 (6.4%), and operating room fire by 18 (3.5%). Although 414 (79.9%) respondents felt that time-outs before the case have been the single most impactful checklist component to prevent serious patient safety events, several respondents also voiced frustrations with the administrative burden.Conclusion. Surgical safety checklists are widely used in otolaryngology and are generally acknowledged as the most effective intervention to reduce patient safety events; nonetheless, intraoperative sentinel events do continue to occur. Understanding the scope, causes, and response to these events may help to prioritize resources to guide quality improvement initiatives in surgical safety practices.

TI  - Evaluating Forest Cover and Fragmentation in Costa Rica with a Corrected Global Tree Cover Map
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global tree cover products face challenges in accurately predicting tree cover across biophysical gradients, such as precipitation or agricultural cover. To generate a natural forest cover map for Costa Rica, biases in tree cover estimation in the most widely used tree cover product (the Global Forest Change product (GFC) were quantified and corrected, and the impact of map biases on estimates of forest cover and fragmentation was examined. First, a forest reference dataset was developed to examine how the difference between reference and GFC-predicted tree cover estimates varied along gradients of precipitation and elevation, and nonlinear statistical models were fit to predict the bias. Next, an agricultural land cover map was generated by classifying Landsat and ALOS PalSAR imagery (overall accuracy of 97%) to allow removing six common agricultural crops from estimates of tree cover. Finally, the GFC product was corrected through an integrated process using the nonlinear predictions of precipitation and elevation biases and the agricultural crop map as inputs. The accuracy of tree cover prediction increased by approximate to 29% over the original global forest change product (the R-2 rose from 0.416 to 0.538). Using an optimized 89% tree cover threshold to create a forest/nonforest map, we found that fragmentation declined and core forest area and connectivity increased in the corrected forest cover map, especially in dry tropical forests, protected areas, and designated habitat corridors. By contrast, the core forest area decreased locally where agricultural fields were removed from estimates of natural tree cover. This research demonstrates a simple, transferable methodology to correct for observed biases in the Global Forest Change product. The use of uncorrected tree cover products may markedly over- or underestimate forest cover and fragmentation, especially in tropical regions with low precipitation, significant topography, and/or perennial agricultural production.

TI  - A Satellite-Derived Upper-Ocean Stratification Data Set for the Tropical North Atlantic With Potential Applications for Hurricane Intensity Prediction
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Upper-ocean stratification strongly impacts vertical mixing and the heat flux between the ocean and atmosphere, especially under extreme conditions of tropical cyclones (TCs). Knowledge of prestorm stratification is important for accurate TC intensity prediction. In situ observations of the tropical ocean have significantly increased in the past decade. However, they are still too sparse to resolve ocean stratification variability in near-real time and on small spatial scales. In this study, based on long-term observations and an ocean reanalysis data set from 2004-2017, we investigate the possibility of retrieving upper-ocean stratification from sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea surface height (SSH) using a simple regression method. It is found that more than 90% of the mean seasonal cycle and about 30% to 80% of temperature and salinity stratification anomalies can be reconstructed using surface data from either observations or an ocean reanalysis. Simple regression can be used with satellite observations to create a high-resolution, near-real-time-gridded ocean stratification data set that successfully reproduces both the large and mesoscale variability of ocean stratification. When used in a simple expression for TC-induced SST cooling, the satellite-derived stratification shows improvements over an ocean analysis in terms of variance explained of SST cooling, offering promise as a near-real-time indicator of the ocean's impact on TC intensification.Key PointsInferring upper-ocean stratification from surface data is feasible with simple regression Stratification data set created using satellite data and a statistical model can realistically reproduce large and mesoscale features An example of the potential usefulness of the stratification data set is illustrated for tropical cyclone intensity prediction

TI  - The Influence of Land Surface Temperature in Evapotranspiration Estimated by the S-SEBI Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the least understood components of the hydrological cycle. Its applications are varied, from agricultural, ecological and hydrological monitoring, to control of the evolution of climate change. The goal of this work was to analyze the influence that uncertainties in the estimate of land surface temperature (Ts) can cause on ET estimates by S-SEBI model in the Pampa biome area. Also, the specificities of native grassland of Pampa biome related to energy balance were analyzed. The results indicate that the daily evapotranspiration is higher when the pixel Ts is lower, which also shows the influence of land use on the variability of ET. The results demonstrated that the S-SEBI is less dependent on Ts estimation than other models reported in the literature, such as the SEBS, which not exceed 0.5 mm/day in grasslands. The evapotranspiration variability between forest and grassland were lower than expected, demonstrating that the Pampa biome have in Rio Grande do Sul the same importance that forests regarding to the processes of the hydrological cycle, since it covers 63% of the State.

TI  - Contrasting responses of land-terminating glaciers to recent climate variations in King George Island, Antarctica
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aim to analyse the glacier dynamics of land-terminating glaciers in King George Island (Antarctica) between 1956 and 2018. Glacial fluctuations are estimated using space-borne remote sensing data (SPOT, Landsat, PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, WorldView-2 and TanDEM-X). The eastern sector of Warszawa Icefield witnessed continuous glacier retreat during 1979-2018 (surface loss of 30%). The decreases in the ice-covered areas of the Tower, Windy, Ecology, Baranowski and Sphinx glaciers were 70%, 31%, 25%, 25% and 21%, respectively, with their accumulation area ratios (AARs) exhibiting negative mass balances. The winter air temperature was cooler during the 1970s with warming trends in the 1980s and early 2000s followed by a cooling trend until the present day. However, the annual time series has shown high interannual variability in air temperature during these periods. We show that the AAR, dimensions, length, frontal elevation, maximum elevation, slope and changes in the terminus position influence the glacier response to climate change at various timescales. Furthermore, three geomorphic activity intensity zones and a complete paraglacial sequence are identified while contrasting the proglacial systems. Overall, subglacial deposits predominate and indicate that meltwater flows on the bed, producing wet-based thermal regimes.

TI  - Compact Polarimetry Response to Modeled Fast Sea Ice Thickness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact Polarimetric (CP) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is expected to gain more and more ground for Earth observation applications in the coming years. This comes in light of the recently launched RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), which uniquely provides CP SAR imagery in operational mode. In this study, we present observations about the sensitivity of CP SAR imagery to thickness of thermodynamically-grown fast sea ice during early ice growth (September-December 2017) in the Resolute Bay area, Canadian Central Arctic. Fast ice is most suitable to use for this preliminary study since it exhibits only thermodynamic growth in absence of ice mobility and deformation. Results reveal that ice thickness up to 30 cm can be retrieved using several CP parameters from the tested set. This ice thickness corresponds to the thickness of young ice. We found the surface scattering mechanism to be dominant during the early ice growth, exposing an increasing tendency up to 30 cm thickness with a correlation coefficient with the thickness equal to 0.86. The degree of polarization was found to be the parameter with the highest correlation up to 0.95. While thickness retrieval within the same range is also possible using parameters from Full Polarimetric (FP) SAR parameters as shown in previous studies, the advantage of using CP SAR mode is the much larger swath coverage, which is an operational requirement.

TI  - Identifying the outbreak signal of COVID-19 before the response of the traditional disease monitoring system
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - New coronavirus cases and related deaths are continuing to occur worldwide. Early identification of the emergence of novel outbreaks of infectious diseases is critical to the generation of timely responses. We performed a comparative study to determine the feasibility of the early detection of the COVID-19 outbreak in China based on influenza surveillance data and the internet-based Baidu search index to evaluate the timelines of the alert signals compared with the traditional case reporting and response systems. An abnormal increase in the number of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) occurred at least one month earlier than the clinical reports of pneumonia with unknown causes and the conventional monitoring system. The peak of the search volume was 20 days earlier than the issuance of the massive official warning about the epidemic. The findings from this study suggest that monitoring abnormal surges of ILI and identifying peaks of online searches of key terms can provide early signals of novel disease outbreaks. We emphasize the importance of broadening the potential of syndromic surveillance, internet searches, and social media data together with the traditional disease surveillance system to enhance early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.SynopsisEarly identification of the emergence of an outbreak of a novel infectious disease is critical to generating a timely response. The traditional monitoring system is adequate for detecting the outbreak of common diseases; however, it is insufficient for the discovery of novel infectious diseases. In this study, we used COVID-19 as an example to compare the delay time of different tools for identifying disease outbreaks. The results showed that both the abnormal spike in influenza-like illnesses and the peak of online searches of key terms could provide early signals. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings and discussing the broader potential to use syndromic surveillance, internet searches, and social media data together with traditional disease surveillance systems for early detection and understanding of novel emerging infectious diseases.

First, the rainfall depth-duration relationship was estimated based on radar-gauge merged rainfall data with 1 km-10 min spacetime resolution for 319 highly urbanized watersheds of the study area, for the extreme rainfall event occurred on the September 11, 2017 in Busan, Korea. The rainfall depth-duration relationship at the watersheds were further categorized by the nine different domains of the rainfall temporal variability and the watershed flooded area proportion that is estimated from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data analysis. The minimum possible slope of the depth-duration relationship in each of the domain was determined as the flood warning rainfall intensity threshold for this urban area. The results revealed that 55 mm/hr of rainfall intensity was the universal threshold. When this threshold was applied to issue the flood warning, the number of missed warning was minimized at the expense of the increased frequencies of false warnings. The highest identified threshold was 73 mm/hr. It was also found that the temporally variable rainfall is more likely to cause floods than the one with less temporal variability. The identified rainfall threshold values were validated against the 2010 and 2011 extreme events occurred in Seoul, Korea. The validation revealed that the balance between the accuracy and the reliability of the flood warning system highly depends on the choice of the tolerable flooded area proportions. The study reveals the great potential of operational urban flood warning system composed of a weather radar and a network of ground rainfall gauges that can be simply established using satellite-based flooded area data, which may be especially useful for developing countries.

TI  - Fine-scale detection of vegetation in semi-arid mountainous areas with focus on riparian landscapes using Sentinel-2 and UAV data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse vegetation such as riparian forests and trees outside forests (TOF) cover only small areas but present various ecological advantages. The detection of these vegetation types in semi-arid mountainous areas is challenging as trees are heavily mixed with other land cover types. Their mapping requires therefore high-resolution imagery. We propose to leverage the advantages and synergies of freely available Sentinel-2 data and a lightweight consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a simple red-greenblue (RGB) camera to detect these vegetation types. In our approach, an object-based random forest land cover classification is first developed over smaller sites using very high-resolution UAV data. The resulting maps are afterwards used as training data for multi-temporal Sentinel-2 based classifications at regional scale. We tested the approach in five different riparian landscapes of a semi-arid mountainous area in Iran. For comparison, monoand multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data were also used alone - without support from UAV data - to build pixel-based random forest classification models at regional scale. Our results show that compared to the best mono-temporal results, the multi-temporal classification approach improved the overall accuracy and Kappa values of Sentinel-2 classifications from 77.0% to 83.9% and 0.72 to 0.81, respectively. The producer's and user's accuracy of the riparian forest class were also improved from 64.0% to 70.0% and 57.1% to 73.7%, respectively. Combining UAV and Sentinel-2 data improved the overall accuracy only slightly, but enabled a much better detection of Persian oak stands - for this class, the producer's accuracy increased by 13.0 percentage points. Overall, we recommend the combined use of UAV and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data to detect Persian oak forest stands.

TI  - CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES, MIXOTROPHIC CILILATES, AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES IN NORTH PATAGONIAN LAKES, INVESTIGATED BY REMOTE SENSING
T2  - CRUSTACEANA
M3  - Article
AB  - North Patagonian lakes are characterized by their oligotrophic or oligo-mesotrophic status. These conditions bring with them, respectively, the presence of abundant mixotrophic ciliates and a low species number of crustacean zooplankton under oligotrophic status, and low numbers of mixotrophic ciliates and a high species number of zooplankton under oligo-mesotrophic status. The aims of the present study are, (1) to use remote sensing techniques for determining abundances of mixotrophic ciliates and crustacean zooplankton, and (2) to characterize these mixotrophic and zooplankton communities by using null models. The sensing was accomplished from a satellite, i.e., by measuring the reflectance of the sunlight on a waterbody, which result will vary according to the contents of the water column. The results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that sites with low reflectance of all bands have a high abundance of Stentor accompanied by low zooplankton absolute abundance, whereas a markedly opposite situation was observed under high reflectance, where Stentor has low abundance in conjunction with high zooplankton absolute abundances. The null models revealed that the communities in the studied sites do not have structured species associations, and that there is an overlap of niches. These results obtained agree with similar observations for Argentinean Patagonian lakes.

TI  - COVID-19 Surveillance in a Primary Care Sentinel Network: In-Pandemic Development of an Application Ontology
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Creating an ontology for COVID-19 surveillance should help ensure transparency and consistency. Ontologies formalize conceptualizations at either the domain or application level. Application ontologies cross domains and are specified through testable use cases. Our use case was an extension of the role of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) to monitor the current pandemic and become an in-pandemic research platform.Objective: This study aimed to develop an application ontology for COVID-19 that can be deployed across the various use-case domains of the RCGP RSC research and surveillance activities.Methods: We described our domain-specific use case. The actor was the RCGP RSC sentinel network, the system was the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcomes were the spread and effect of mitigation measures. We used our established 3-step method to develop the ontology, separating ontological concept development from code mapping and data extract validation. We developed a coding system-independent COVID-19 case identification algorithm. As there were no gold-standard pandemic surveillance ontologies, we conducted a rapid Delphi consensus exercise through the International Medical Informatics Association Primary Health Care Informatics working group and extended networks.Results: Our use-case domains included primary care, public health, virology, clinical research, and clinical informatics. Our ontology supported (1) case identification, microbiological sampling, and health outcomes at an individual practice and at the national level; (2) feedback through a dashboard; (3) a national observatory; (4) regular updates for Public Health England; and (5) transformation of a sentinel network into a trial platform. We have identified a total of 19,115 people with a definite COVID-19 status, 5226 probable cases, and 74,293 people with possible COVID-19, within the RCGP RSC network (N=5,370,225).Conclusions: The underpinning structure of our ontological approach has coped with multiple clinical coding challenges. At a time when there is uncertainty about international comparisons, clarity about the basis on which case definitions and outcomes are made from routine data is essential.

TI  - Rules for Recovery: Impact of Indexed Disaster Funds on Shock Coping in Mexico
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Government provision of disaster transfers is typically hampered by liquidity constraints and by weak rules and administrative capacity to disburse reconstruction resources. We show that by easing these hurdles, Mexico's indexed disaster fund (Fonden) considerably accelerates economic recovery after a disaster. To estimate Fonden impact on recovery, as measured by night lights, we exploit the heavy rainfall index that determines program eligibility. We find that for one year after a disaster, eligible municipalities are 6 percent brighter than those ineligible, with gains likely concentrated among less resilient municipalities. We additionally document how Fonden rules shield resources from political abuse.

TI  - Extracting urban impervious surfaces from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data for urban planning and environmental management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface is mainly defined as any surface which water cannot infiltrate the soil. Due to the impact of urban impervious surfaces (UIS) on environmental issues, the amount of impervious surfaces has been recognized as the most significant index of environmental quality. Detection and analysis of impervious surfaces within a watershed is one of the developing areas of scientific interest. This study evaluates and compares the accuracy and performance of five classification algorithms-supervised object-based nearest neighbour (NN) classifier, supervised pixel-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), supervised pixel-based spectral angle mapper (SAM), band ratioing normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference impervious index (NDII)-in extracting urban impervious surfaces. Our first aim was to identify the most effective method for mapping UIS using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellite data. The second aim was to compare and reveal the efficiency of the spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data in extracting UIS. The results revealed that the supervised object-based NN approach using the visible and near-infrared bands of both satellite imagery produced the most homogenous and accurate map among the other methods. The object-based NN algorithm achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.91% and 88.64%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.82 and 0.77 for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, respectively. The study also showed that the Sentinel-2 image yielded better results than the Landsat-8 pan-sharpened image in extracting detail and classification accuracy. Comparing these methods in the selected challenging study area can provide insight into the selection of the classification method for rapid and reliable extraction of UIS.

TI  - Potential and Limitations of Satellite Altimetry Constellations for Monitoring Surface Water Storage Changes-A Case Study in the Mississippi Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are essential for monitoring the Earth's surface waters, especially since the amount of publicly available in-situ data is declining. Satellite altimetry provides valuable information on the water levels and variations of lakes, reservoirs and rivers. In combination with satellite imagery, the derived time series allow the monitoring of lake storage changes and river discharge. However, satellite altimetry is limited in terms of its spatial resolution due to its measurement geometry, only providing information in the nadir direction beneath the satellite's orbit. In a case study in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), this study investigates the potential and limitations of past and current satellite missions for the monitoring of basin-wide storage changes. For that purpose, an automated target detection is developed and the extracted lake surfaces are merged with the satellites' tracks. This reveals that the current altimeter configuration misses about 80% of all lakes larger than 0.1 km2 in the MRB and 20% of lakes larger than 10 km2, corresponding to 30% and 7% of the total water area, respectively. Past altimetry configurations perform even more poorly. From the larger water bodies represented by a global hydrology model, at least 91% of targets and 98% of storage changes are captured by the current altimeter configuration. This will improve significantly with the launch of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

TI  - Adrenal gland response to endocrine disrupting chemicals in fishes, amphibians and reptiles: A comparative overview
T2  - GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The adrenal gland is an essential component of the body stress response; it is formed by two portions: a steroidogenic and a chromaffin tissue. Despite the anatomy of adrenal gland is different among classes of vertebrates, the hormones produced are almost the same. During stress, these hormones contribute to body homeostasis and maintenance of ion balance. The adrenal gland is very sensitive to toxic compounds, many of which behave like endocrine-disruptor chemicals (EDCs). They contribute to alter the endocrine system in wildlife and humans and are considered as possible responsible of the decline of several vertebrate ectotherms. Considering that EDCs regularly can be found in all environmental matrices, the aim of this review is to collect information about the impact of these chemical compounds on the adrenal gland of fishes, amphibians and reptiles. In particular, this review shows the different behavior of these "sentinel species" when they are exposed to stress condition. The data supplied in this review can help to further elucidate the role of EDCs and their harmful impact on the survival of these vertebrates.

TI  - Remote sensing phenological monitoring framework to characterize corn and soybean physiological growing stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenological dynamics of crops reflect the response and feedback of agricultural systems to climate and environmental constraints, and have significant controls on carbon and nutrient cycling across the globe. Remote monitoring of crop phenological dynamics in a consistent and systematic manner is vitally crucial for optimizing the farm management activities and evaluating the agricultural resilience to extreme weather conditions and future climate change. Yet our ability to retrieve crop growing stages with satellite time series is limited. The remotely sensed phenological transition dates may not be characteristic of crop physiological growing stages. The objective of this study is to develop a remote sensing phenological monitoring framework that can reconcile satellite-based phenological measures with ground-based crop growing observations, with corn and soybean in Illinois as a case study. The framework comprises three key components: time series phenological pre-processing, time series phenological modeling, and time series phenological characterization. As an exploratory prototype, the framework retrieved a total of 56 phenological transition dates that were subsequently evaluated with the district-level ground phenological observations. The results indicated that the devised framework can adequately retrieve a wide range of physiological growing stages for corn and soybean in Illinois, with R square greater than 0.6 and RMSE less than 1 week for most stages. The devised framework largely extends the limited satellite phenological measures to a range of phenological transition dates that are characteristic of essential crop growing stages. It paves the way for formulating standard crop phenological monitoring protocols via remote sensing. The wealth of retrieved phenological characteristics open up unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the crop growth in response to varying environmental stresses, and to make more adaptive farm management strategies towards sustained agricultural development.

TI  - Nearly Half of Global Vegetated Area Experienced Inconsistent Vegetation Growth in Terms of Greenness, Cover, and Productivity
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The considerable interest in detecting global vegetation changes based on satellite observations is increasing. However, studies rely on single indices to explore the driving mechanisms of the greening trend might exacerbate uncertainties of global ecosystem change. Thus, vegetation growth dynamics from various biophysical properties required to be monitored comprehensively. In this study, a consistent framework for evaluating vegetation growth trends was developed based on five widely used satellite-derived products of MODIS Collection 6; the consistency in vegetation growth was mapped; and the factors that affected the consistency of vegetation growth were explored. The results showed that, during 2000-2015, 45.6% of global vegetated area experienced inconsistent trends in vegetation greenness, cover and productivity, especially in evergreen broadleaf forests, grasslands, open shrublands, woody savannas and croplands. Only 5.4% of global vegetated area exhibited simultaneous trends in greenness, cover and productivity, and the inconsistent areas were expanding in the study period. Contradictory vegetation changes were mainly reflected in the opposite trends of vegetation greenness and productivity in evergreen broadleaf forests. Moreover, the inconsistency change was mainly manifested in the greenness-dominated vegetation enhancement, without enhanced productivity. The increment difference between NPP and GPP also showed respiration losses greatly offset the effect of vegetation greenness or cover on productivity. This study provides integrated insights for understanding the inconsistency of vegetation structural and functional changes in the context of global greening.

This study investigated the potential of using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data from the harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) products for crop biomass estimation for six crops in Manitoba, Canada. Crop biomass was estimated using remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) to reparametrize a simple crop growth model. The results showed that the LAI of six different crops can be estimated using a generic relationship between LAI and red-edge based vegetation indices (VIs, e.g., modified simple ratio red-edge (MSRRE) and red-edge normalized difference VI (NDVIRE)) for the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) of Sentinel-2. For the Operational Land Imager of Landsat 8 without the red-edge band, LAI can be best estimated using a VI derived from Near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI1). Above-ground dry biomass of these six crops was more accurately estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from both satellites (R-2 (the coefficient of determination) = 0.81, RMSE (the root-mean-square-error) = 135.4 g/m(2), nRMSE (the normalized RMSE) 37.9%, RPD (the ratio of percent deviation) = 2.26) than that of LAI derived from MSI-data (R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 136.7 g/m(2) , nRMSE = 38.3%, RPD = 2.23) or that from LAI derived from OLI-data (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 191.0 g/m(2), nRMSE = 53.5%, RPD = 1.16). Further analysis showed that these three assimilation cases (MSI and OLI; MSI alone; OLI alone) with a different number of LAI observations resulted in differences in parameter optimization, particularly the parameters relevant to crop phenology and biomass partitioning. Both crop growth stage (e.g., the emergence date for crop growth) and leaf dry biomass estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from MSI and OLI, or MSI alone, produced the most accurate estimates. These results are likely attributed to the improved temporal coverage associated with Sentinel-2 and the availability of a red-edge band on this sensor.

TI  - The impact of Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) on health services use, health related quality of life, and costs: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Older adults (age 65 and older) use the emergency department (ED) at a rate of nearly 50 ED visits per 100 older adults, accounting for over 23 million ED visits in the US annually, up to 20% of all ED visits. These ED visits are sentinel health events as discharged patients often return to the ED, experience declines in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability, or are later hospitalized. Those who are admitted incur increased costs and greater risk for poor outcomes including infections, delirium, and falls. The objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of the Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program, an ED nurse-led geriatric assessment and care coordination program, in decreasing unnecessary health services use and improving Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) for older adults in the ED.Methods: Community dwelling older adults aged 65 and older who are vulnerable or frail according to the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) during an ED visit will be randomized to either GEDI (n = 420) or to usual ED care (n = 420). Outcome variables will be assessed during the ED visit and at 7-11 days and 28-32 days post ED visit.Projected outcomes: The primary outcome is hospitalization or death within 30 days of the ED visit. Secondary outcomes include health service use outcomes (ED visits and hospitalizations), healthcare costs, and HRQoL outcomes [Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores: PROMIS-Preference, Physical Function, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Anxiety, and Depression].

TI  - Impact of urban expansion on land surface temperature in Fuzhou, China using Landsat imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seven Landsat images were used to assess urban expansion and the corresponding thermal characteristics in Fuzhou City, China between 1985 and 2015. The urban surface thermal patterns were investigated by retrieving land surface temperature using a single-window algorithm based on atmospheric calibration. The built-up area doubled from 1985 (10.6 %) to 2015 (23.4 %), mostly from cropland conversions in the urban fringe, and was closely associated with population increase (R-2 = 0.93), gross domestic production GDP (R-2 = 0.97), and fixed asset investments (R-2 = 0.9139), illustrating the contributions of socioeconomic factors to rapid urban expansion. The daytime heating effect (heat source) in urban areas was strongly related to urban expansion, with a high percentage of an impervious surface usually associated with a high surface temperature. The average range over which wetlands affected built-up area, farmland, and road was 381, 321, and 347 m, respectively. The area of influence on construction land and road was 151 and 11 km(2), respectively, whereas the average value for farmland was 147 km(2). The area of wetland influence decreased during the study period, and therefore one explanation for the increase in the urban heat island (UHI) in Fuzhou City was the weakened cooling effect of wetland.

TI  - Improving PSI Processing of Mining Induced Large Deformations with External Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidences, either caused by natural phenomena or human activities, can threaten the safety of nearby infrastructures and residents. Among the different causes, mining operations can trigger strong subsidence phenomena with a fast nonlinear temporal behaviour. Therefore, a reliable and precise deformation monitoring is of great significance for safe mining and protection of facilities located above or near the mined-out area. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a technique that uses stacks Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to remotely monitor the ground deformation of large areas with a high degree of precision at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, PSI presents limitations when monitoring large gradient deformations when there is phase ambiguity among adjacent Persistent Scatterer (PS) points. In this paper, an improvement of PSI processing, named as External Model-based Deformation Decomposition PSI (EMDD-PSI), is proposed to address this limitation by taking advantage of an external model. The proposed method first uses interferograms generated from SAR Single Look Complex (SLC) images to optimize the parameter adjustments of the external model. Then, the modelled spatial distribution of subsidence is utilized to reduce the fringes of the interferograms generated from the SAR images and to ease the PSI processing. Finally, the ground deformation is retrieved by jointly adding the external model and PSI results. In this paper, fourteen Radarsat-2 SAR images over Fengfeng mining area (China) are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method. The results are evaluated by comparing them with leveling data of the area covering the same temporal period. Results have shown that, after the optimization, the model is able to mimic the real deformation and the fringes of the interferograms can be effectively reduced. As a consequence, the large gradient deformation then can be better retrieved with the preservation of the nonlinear subsidence term. The ground truth shows that, comparing with the classical PSI and PSI with unadjusted parameters, the proposed scheme reduces the error by 35.2% and 20.4%, respectively.

TI  - Epidemiologic significance of<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>infections in chickens (<i>Gallus domesticus</i>): the past decade
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Toxoplasma gondiiinfections are common in humans and animals worldwide. Domestic free-range chickens (Gallus domesticus) are excellent sentinels of environmental contamination withT. gondiioocysts because they feed on the ground. Chickens can be easily infected withT. gondii; however, clinical toxoplasmosis is rare in these hosts. Chickens are comparatively inexpensive and thus are good sentinel animals forT. gondiiinfections on the farms. Here, the authors reviewed prevalence, the persistence of infection, clinical disease, epidemiology and genetic diversity ofT. gondiistrains isolated from chickens worldwide for the past decade. Data on phenotypic and molecular characteristics of 794 viableT. gondiistrains from chickens are discussed, including new data onT. gondiiisolates from chickens in Brazil. This paper will be of interest to biologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians and parasitologists.

TI  - Using LANDSAT 8 and VENμS Data to Study the Effect of Geodiversity on Soil Moisture Dynamics in a Semiarid Shrubland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is a limiting factor to ecosystem productivity in semiarid shrublands. Long-term droughts due to climatic changes may increase the water stress imposed on these lands. Recent observations demonstrate positive relations between geodiversity-expressed by the degree of soil stoniness-and SMC in the upper soil layers. This suggests that areas of high geodiversity can potentially provide a haven for plant survival under water scarcity conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of geodiversity on the dynamics of SMC in semiarid environments, which so far has not been fully investigated. The optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) applied to six-year time series data (November 2013-July 2018), obtained from LANDSAT 8 and highly correlated with field measurements (R-2 = 0.96), shows here that the SMC in hillslopes with high geodiversity is consistently greater than that in hillslopes with low geodiversity. During winter periods (December-March), the difference between the two hillslope types was similar to 7%, while during summer periods (June-September) it reduced to similar to 4%. By using the high-resolution spectral-spatiotemporal VEN mu S data, we further studied the geodiversity mechanism during summertime, and at a smaller spatial scale. The VEN mu S-based Crop Water Content Index (CWCI) was compared with the OPTRAM measurements (R-2 = 0.71). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test showed that water loss in the high-geodiversity areas during summers was very small (p-value > 0.1). Furthermore, the biocrust index based on the VEN mu S data showed that biological crust activity in the high-geodiversity hillslopes during summers is high and almost stationary (ADF p-value > 0.1). We suggest that the mechanism responsible for the high SMC in the high-geodiversity areas may be related to lower evaporation rates in the dry season and high runoff rates in the wet season, both of which are the combined result of the greater presence of developed biocrusts and stoniness in the areas of higher geodiversity.

TI  - Understanding satellite images: a data mining module for Sentinel images
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased number of free and open Sentinel satellite images has led to new applications of these data. Among them is the systematic classification of land cover/use types based on patterns of settlements or agriculture recorded by these images, in particular, the identification and quantification of their temporal changes. In this paper, we will present guidelines and practical examples of how to obtain rapid and reliable image patch labelling results and their validation based on data mining techniques for detecting these temporal changes, and presenting these as classification maps and/or statistical analytics. This represents a new systematic validation approach for semantic image content verification. We will focus on a number of different scenarios proposed by the user community using Sentinel data. From a large number of potential use cases, we selected three main cases, namely forest monitoring, flood monitoring, and macro-economics/urban monitoring.

TI  - Ecology rather than people restrict gene flow in Okavango-Kalahari lions
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced gene exchange between animal populations may be an indicator of the effects of anthropogenic fragmentation or it may reflect natural gradients in the landscape that can also result in population fragmentation. It can be difficult, therefore, to disentangle the role of local ecology from anthropogenic factors, creating a risk of attributing a lack of gene flow as being due to human activities, leading to ill-informed management decisions. Here, we test the ecological and anthropogenic factors driving population differentiation and show how the relative influence of such effects can be identified. Using Bayesian clustering and a causal modelling approach, we combine genetic and remote sensing data to disentangle the confounding influences of ecological and anthropogenic fragmentation. We investigate a region where such confusion may arise; in and around the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. Specifically, we used 20 microsatellites to investigate the genetic structuring of African lionsPanthera leooccupying a landscape dominated by two very different environments, the wetland Okavango and the surrounding Kalahari Desert. We find that differences in ecology, rather than anthropogenic barriers, are driving genetic differences in the population and that despite their ability to disperse long distances these lion populations are differentiated into two distinct genetic groups, one inhabiting the wetland Okavango Delta and the other one inhabiting the surrounding dryland Kalahari, divided by an apparently unobstructed boundary. The genetic structure observed could easily have been misinterpreted as a response to anthropogenic disturbance reducing gene flow. This reinforces the need to consider non-anthropogenic hypotheses, such as ecological differences between habitats, when assessing possible mechanisms of gene flow and their implications for population management. As anthropogenic pressure increases in this region, we recommend conservation managers consider the Okavango population as a separate conservation unit, but also recognize the importance of maintaining the current structural landscape connectivity.

TI  - Anthropization and Climate Change: Impact on the Discharges of Forest Watersheds in Central Africa
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and anthropization are major drivers of river flows variability. However, understanding their simultaneous impact on discharges is limited. As a contribution to address this limitation, the objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate change and anthropization on the discharges of two watersheds of Central Africa (Nyong and Ntem) over a recent period. For this, the hydropluviometric data of the watersheds concerned were analyzed using the Pettitt test. Similarly, the dynamics of the main land use modes (LUM) have been assessed, through classifications obtained from the processing of Landsat satellite images of the watersheds studied on two dates. The results of this study show that in Central Africa, annual discharges have decreased significantly since the 1970s, and yet the decline in annual rainfall does not become significant until the 2000s. The discharges of the rainy seasons (spring and autumn) recorded the most important changes, following variations in the rainfall patterns of the dry seasons (winter and summer) that precede them. Winters experienced a significant decrease in precipitation between the 1970s and 1990s, which caused a drop in spring flows. Their rise, which began in the 2000s, is also accompanied by an increase in spring flows, which nevertheless seems rather slight in the case of the Nyong. Conversely, between the 1970s and 1990s, there was a joint increase in summer rainfall and autumn flows. A decrease of summer rainfall was noted since the 2000s, and is also noticeable in autumn flows. Maximum flows have remained constant on the Nyong despite the slight drop in rainfall. This seems to be the consequence of changes in land use patterns (diminution of forest and increasing of impervious areas). The decrease in maximums flows noted on the Ntem could be linked to the slight drop in precipitation during the rainy seasons that generates it. Factors such as the general decrease in precipitation during the winter and the reduction in the area occupied by water bodies could justify the decrease in minimum flows observed in the two watersheds. These findings would be vital to enhance water management capabilities in the watersheds concerned and in the region. They can also give some new elements to study and understand the seasonal variation and fresh water availability in downstream, estuaries and coastal areas of the regional rivers.

TI  - Outdoor Residual Insecticide Spraying (ODRS), a New Approach for the Control of the Exophilic Vectors of Human Visceral Leishmaniasis:<i>Phlebotomus orientalis</i>in East Africa
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) due toLeishmania donovaniis a neglected protozoan parasitic disease in humans, which is usually fatal if untreated.Phlebotomus orientalis, the predominant VL vector in East Africa, is a highly exophilic/exophagic species that poses a major challenge to current Integrated Vector Management (IVM). Here we report results of pilot studies conducted in rural villages in Gedarif state, Sudan, to evaluate outdoor residual spraying of 20mg active ingredient (a.i.) /m(2)deltamethrin insecticide applied to the characteristic household compound boundary reed fence and to the outside of household buildings (Outdoor Residual Insecticide Spraying, ODRS), and as an alternative, spraying restricted to the boundary fence only (Restricted Outdoor Residual Insecticide Spraying, RODRS). Four to six clusters of 20 households were assigned to insecticide treatments or control in three experiments. Changes in sand fly numbers were monitored over 2,033 trap-nights over 43-76 days follow-up in four sentinel houses per cluster relative to unsprayed control clusters. Sand fly numbers were monitored by sticky traps placed on the ground on the inside ("outdoor") and the outside ("peridomestic") of the boundary fence, and by CDC light traps suspended outdoors in the household compound. The effects of ODRS on sand fly numbers inside sleeping huts were monitored by insecticide knockdown. After a single application, ODRS reducedP.orientalisabundance by 83%-99% in outdoor and peridomestic trap locations. ODRS also reduced numbers ofP.orientalisfound resting inside sleeping huts. RODRS reduced outdoor and peridomesticP.orientalisby 60%-88%. By direct comparison, RODRS was 58%-100% as effective as ODRS depending on the trapping method. These impacts were immediate on intervention and persisted during follow-up, representing a large fraction of theP.orientalisactivity season. Relative costs of ODRS and RODRS delivery were $5.76 and $3.48 per household, respectively. The study demonstrates the feasibility and high entomological efficacy of ODRS and RODRS, and the expected low costs relative to current IVM practises. These methods represent novel sand fly vector control tools against predominantly exophilic/exophagic sand fly vectors, aimed to lower VL burdens in Sudan, with potential application in other endemic regions in East Africa.

TI  - Making the most of scarce data: Mapping distribution range and variation in population abundance of a threatened narrow-range endemic plant
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of effective strategies for the conservation and management of threatened narrow-range species requires basic knowledge on their geographic distribution and abundance. When such knowledge is lacking, modelling techniques can provide an opportunity to acquire basic information and incorporate it immediately into conservation programs. This study used ecological niche modelling to map the potential distribution range and rangewide variation in population abundance of a threatened narrow-range endemic plant, Antirrhinum lopesianum Rothm. in the Iberian Peninsula. We simulated the potential geographic distribution of the species using the Ensemble Modelling approach based on 28 species occurrences and a set of readily available environmental data (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and LiDAR) and created a spatial model of the distance to the niche centmid. We tested the relationships between 35 records with abundance data for the species and their distance to the niche centroid using generalized regression models, and the resulting model was used to predict spatial estimations of A. lopesianum abundance across its entire potential distribution range. The ecological niche model of A. lopesianum covered the most suitable areas located along a narrow strip on the banks of the River Duero and River Sabor. We found a robust and negative relationship between observed abundance for the taxon and distance to the niche centroid. The spatially explicit model presented here provides a reliable tool for regional/ global management and conservation of A. lopesianum and an approach applicable for other narrow-range endemic plants. Finally, this approach maximization the exploitation of basic information through open resources (software and environmental variables), which makes it of high interest for institutions with limited resources.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: There has been a demand for a tumor-specific marker for metastatic lymph nodes in sentinel navigation surgery for gastric cancer. The aim of this study is to analyze protein expression in both primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes in early gastric cancer patients.Methods: We collected primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes from 71 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy and pathologically diagnosed with T1N1 or T1N2 (8th Union for International Cancer Control 8th edition/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system) gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of six cell membrane proteins, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), E-cadherin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), P-cadherin, CD44v6, and c-erbB2 in the patient samples.Results: The expression of CEA, E-cadherin, EpCAM, P-cadherin, CD44v6 and c-erbB2 in the evaluable primary tumor samples was 75.4%, 97.1%, 100%, 89.9%, 11.1% and 7.2%, respectively. Among cases wherein both the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes were evaluable, double positivity (expression in both primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes) was observed for CEA, E-cadherin, EpCAM, P-cadherin, CD44v6 and c-erbB2 in 53.2%, 97.9%, 98.1%, 76.6%, 0 and 6.8% of the cases, respectively. The proportion of metastatic lymph nodes positive for CEA, E-cadherin, EpCAM, P-cadherin, CD44v6 and c-erbB2 was 71.4%, 100%, 98.1%, 83.7%, 0, and 75%, respectively in primary tumors positive for the same markers.Conclusions: E-cadherin and EpCAM had an overlap of 100% and 98.1% between the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes, respectively. Thus, E-cadherin and EpCAM are potential molecular markers to detect metastatic lymph nodes in patients with early gastric cancer.

TI  - Flood Hazard Risk Mapping Using a Pseudo Supervised Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Devastating floods occur regularly around the world. Recently, machine learning models have been used for flood susceptibility mapping. However, even when these algorithms are provided with adequate ground truth training samples, they can fail to predict flood extends reliably. On the other hand, the height above nearest drainage (HAND) model can produce flood prediction maps with limited accuracy. The objective of this research is to produce an accurate and dynamic flood modeling technique to produce flood maps as a function of water level by combining the HAND model and machine learning. In this paper, the HAND model was utilized to generate a preliminary flood map; then, the predictions of the HAND model were used to produce pseudo training samples for a R.F. model. To improve the R.F. training stage, five of the most effective flood mapping conditioning factors are used, namely, Altitude, Slope, Aspect, Distance from River and Land use/cover map. In this approach, the R.F. model is trained to dynamically estimate the flood extent with the pseudo training points acquired from the HAND model. However, due to the limited accuracy of the HAND model, a random sample consensus (RANSAC) method was used to detect outliers. The accuracy of the proposed model for flood extent prediction, was tested on different flood events in the city of Fredericton, NB, Canada in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019. Furthermore, to ensure that the proposed model can produce accurate flood maps in other areas as well, it was also tested on the 2019 flood in Gatineau, QC, Canada. Accuracy assessment metrics, such as overall accuracy, Cohen's kappa coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), were used to compare the predicted flood extent of the study areas, to the extent estimated by the HAND model and the extent imaged by Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites. The results confirm that the proposed model can improve the flood extent prediction of the HAND model without using any ground truth training data.

TI  - Leveraging the increased rates of pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer to de-escalate surgical treatments
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Breast conservative surgery (BCS) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) is safe and effective for selected patients. This aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of anatomic site of response on outcomes and to assess the real population who may benefit from nonsurgical approaches after NAT. Material and Methods From a prospectively maintained database, patients with T1-4 N0-2 breast cancer undergoing NAT were identified. Clinicopathological and survival rates were compared in relation to response and anatomic site of response. Results Six hundred and forty-six patients were included in the study. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was an independent factor for BCS and SLN. HER2 positive and TN tumors with cN0 achieving a breast pCR remain ypN0 (p = .002). Residual axillary disease was associated with breast residual tumor (p = .05) and subtype (p = .001). With a median follow up of 35.25 months, patients with any pCR had improved survival when compared with partial response, but not significant differences between pCR, axillary pCR, or breast pCR. Conclusion Achieving a pCR increases BCS and SLN. In selected subgroups, sparing any axillary surgery after NAT maybe feasible. In cN+ patients, any pCR was associated with survival, but not the anatomic site of response.

TI  - Relations of land cover, topography, and climate to fire occurrence in natural regions of Iran: Applying new data mining techniques for modeling and mapping fire danger
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, land uses have been changing and aridity has been increasing in the forests and rangelands of central Koohdasht which is a region in the forests of the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. Consequently, the number of fires has also increased. This study employs data-mining techniques to model fire danger using information regarding land cover, climate, topography, and other fire-danger influencing factors. A land cover map was prepared using Sentinel-2A satellite images and a maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. Digital data describing other factors that influence fire danger (slope angle, aspect, elevation, climate, topographic wetness index, and distances from rivers and roads) were compiled from several sources and imported into a GIS. The locations of past fires in the study area were also determined from MODIS satellite images and data acquired from the region's fire service. The quantitative and qualitative spatial relationships between effective factors and patterns of fires were investigated to model fire danger. A new machine-learning algorithm (the Boruta algorithm) was used to assess the relative importance of the fire-danger factors. Fire danger maps were created using several new data-mining algorithms including support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), functional data analysis (FDA), and random forest (RF). All were run in R 3.3.3 software. Finally, the fire danger maps were validated with several indices to determine the model that best predicts the fire danger in Koohdasht County. The results reveal that fire locations were determined mostly by elevation (low), aspect (south and southwest facing slopes), and aridity (semi-arid regions). Most fires occurred in non-natural landscapes: residential areas (46.74% of fires), agricultural lands (25.77%), and gardens (5.42%). In total, 77.93% of fires occurred in non-natural landscapes and within 500 m of roads. Only 22.07% of fires occurred on rangelands and forests. Three factors (distance from roads, climate, and aspect) were the strongest predictors of fire locations in the study area. Furthermore, area-under-the-curve (AUC) values indicate that the FDA (0.777) and GLM (0.772) algorithms generated the most accurate fire danger maps. These results have practical implications for fire danger management in the Zagros forests and provide baseline information for forest managers about the most important factors affecting fire danger in the similar regions. This methodology can be used by forest managers to predict the areas with greatest fire danger to prevent future fires through land use management, planning, and strategic decision-making. The results enable forest managers to find the best methods to monitor, manage, and control fire occurrence based on fire danger maps in the forests of western Iran, or in forests of other regions with similar conditions.

TI  - A Model-Based Volume Estimator that Accounts for Both Land Cover Misclassification and Model Prediction Uncertainty
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest/non-forest and forest species maps are often used by forest inventory programs in the forest estimation process. For example, some inventory programs establish field plots only on lands corresponding to the forest portion of a forest/non-forest map and use species-specific area estimates obtained from those maps to support the estimation of species-specific volume (V) totals. Despite the general use of these maps, the effects of their uncertainties are commonly ignored with the result that estimates might be unreliable. The goal of this study is to estimate the effects of the uncertainty of forest species maps used in the sampling and estimation processes. Random forest (RF) per-pixel predictions were used with model-based inference to estimate V per unit area for the six main forest species of La Rioja, Spain. RF models for predicting V were constructed using field plot information from the Spanish National Forest Inventory and airborne laser scanning data. To limit the prediction of V to pixels classified as one of the main forest species assessed, a forest species map was constructed using Landsat and auxiliary information. Bootstrapping techniques were implemented to estimate the total uncertainty of the V estimates and accommodated both the effects of uncertainty in the Landsat forest species map and the effects of plot-to-plot sampling variability on training data used to construct the RF V models. Standard errors of species-specific total V estimates increased from 2-9% to 3-22% when the effects of map uncertainty were incorporated into the uncertainty assessment. The workflow achieved satisfactory results and revealed that the effects of map uncertainty are not negligible, especially for open-grown and less frequently occurring forest species for which greater variability was evident in the mapping and estimation process. The effects of forest map uncertainty are greater for species-specific area estimation than for the selection of field plots used to calibrate the RF model. Additional research to generalize the conclusions beyond Mediterranean to other forest environments is recommended.

TI  - Complex Surface Displacements above the Storage Cavern Field at Epe, NW-Germany, Observed by Multi-Temporal SAR-Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The storage cavern field at Epe has been brined out of a salt deposit belonging to the lower Rhine salt flat, which extends under the surface of the North German lowlands and part of the Netherlands. Cavern convergence and operational pressure changes cause surface displacements that have been studied for this work with the help of SAR interferometry (InSAR) using distributed and persistent scatterers. Vertical and East-West movements have been determined based on Sentinel-1 data from ascending and descending orbit. Simple geophysical modeling is used to support InSAR processing and helps to interpret the observations. In particular, an approach is presented that allows to relate the deposit pressures with the observed surface displacements. Seasonal movements occurring over a fen situated over the western part of the storage site further complicate the analysis. Findings are validated with ground truth from levelling and groundwater level measurements.

TI  - Integrating satellite data with a Nitrogen Nutrition Curve for precision top-dress fertilization of durum wheat
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study developed a method to use RapidEye satellite information for N management in durum wheat cultivation. The estimation of the N status was based on the development of Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI), referred to as the ratio between actual N concentration (N-ac) and the minimum N content required to obtain maximum biomass (critical N concentration (N-c)). N-c was then calculated by means of a N-c dilution curve, which was calibrated through the use of durum wheat experimental fields (the number varying per year) in Val D'Orcia area (Tuscany) over three consecutive growing seasons from 2009/2010 to 2011/2012, respectively. The data (N-ac and biomass) to produce estimated NNI were obtained by matching the available field samples with information obtained from remote sensing. Statistical analysis indicated that both modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (MCARI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) were the best vegetation indices (VIs) for estimating N-ac and biomass, respectively. The validation, attained using the 2012/2013 experimental field data, showed that the proposed model was very reliable. This could be an effective method in advising farmers on the application of midseason N fertilization treatments, through precision farming operations.

TI  - Sea ice surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8/TIRS: Evaluation of five methods against in situ temperature records and MODIS IST in Arctic region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and high-resolution sea ice surface temperature (IST) data is of great importance for Arctic climate studies. However, the validation of high-resolution IST data using in situ measurements in polar sea ice regions is lacking. This study assesses the accuracy of three split-window (SW) and two single-channel (SC) methods, based on Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery at 100 m resolution over Arctic sea ice regions. The SW methods are proposed by Jin et al. (2015) (SW-Jin), Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014) (SW-JM), and Du et al. (2015) (SW-Du). The SC methods are proposed by Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014) (SC-JM) and Barsi et al. (2003, 2005) (SC-Barsi). IST data derived from 58 scenes of the Landsat 8 images were compared with coincident in situ ice skin temperatures and near-surface air temperatures, as measured by a combination of Ice Mass Balance (IMB) buoys, Snow and Ice Mass Balance Array (SIMBA) buoys, and automatic weather stations. SW-Du offers the best accuracy when compared with the skin temperature (bias: -1.06 K; root mean square error (RMSE): 2.08 K) and near-surface air temperature (bias:-0.98 K; RMSE: 2.17 K). SC-Barsi ranks second, with a bias of -1.55 K and RMSE of 2.40 K for the skin temperature. As for precision, IST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) has best performance (standard deviation (STD): 1.69 K), followed by SW-Du, SW-JM, and SC-Barsi (STD: 1.80 K, 1.82 K, and 1.85 K, respectively). The Landsat IST outperforms the MODIS IST in narrow lead areas, owing to its better spatial resolution, and SW-JM and SC-Barsi methods agree best with the MODIS IST in leads and marginal ice zone scenes, respectively. As all three SW methods are constrained by banding effects with different degrees in a lead scene, they are not recommended to be applied on an image scene with severe banding artifacts. The small bias (1.26 K) and high correlation (0.99) between skin temperature and near-surface air temperature prove the capability of using near-surface air temperature as a substitute for validating a satellite IST data if skin temperature data are not available.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using Spatially Local Xgboost Based on Full-Covered SARA AOD at the Urban Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The adverse effects caused by PM2.5 have drawn extensive concern and it is of great significance to identify its spatial distribution. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used for PM2.5 estimation. However, the coarse spatial resolution and the gaps caused by data deficiency impede its better application at the urban scale. Additionally, obtaining accurate results in unsampled spatial areas when PM2.5 ground sites are insufficient and distribute sparsely is also a challenging issue for PM2.5 spatial distribution estimation. This paper aimed to develop a model, i.e., spatially local extreme gradient boosting (SL-XGB), combining the powerful fitting ability of machine learning and optimal bandwidths of local models, to better estimate PM2.5 concentration at the urban scale by using Beijing as the study area. This paper adopted simplified high-resolution MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm (SARA) AOD at 500 m resolution as the major independent variable, hence, ensuring the estimation can be operated at a fine scale. Moreover, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was adopted to fill the gaps in SARA AOD, thus improving its availability. Then, based on full-covered SARA AOD and other multisource data, the SL-XGB model, integrating multiple local XGBoost models and particular optimal bandwidths, was trained to estimate PM2.5 concentration. For comparison, SL-XGB and two other models, XGBoost and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation (CV). The sample-based CV results reveal that the SL-XGB performed the best as assessed through R-2 (0.88), root mean square error (RMSE = 24.08 mu g/m(3)) and mean prediction error (MPE = 16.90 mu g/m(3)). Additionally, SL-XGB also performed the best in the site-based CV with a R-2 of 0.86, a RMSE of 26.15 mu g/m(3) and a MPE of 17.97 mu g/m(3), which shows its good spatial generalization ability. These results demonstrate that SL-XGB can better simultaneously handle non-linear and spatial heterogeneity issues despite spatially limited data at the urban scale. As far as the PM2.5 concentration distribution was concerned, it presented a gradient increase in PM2.5 concentrations from the northwest to the southeast in Beijing, with abundant spatial details. Overall, the proposed approach for PM2.5 estimation showed outstanding performance and can support preventive pollution control and mitigation at the urban scale.

TI  - Comparing Clinicopathologic Features and Surgical Treatment of Premenopausal Breast Cancer across Italy and China: Report from a Medical Exchange Program
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:This study investigated the differences in clinicopathologic features and surgical treatment between an Italian and a Chinese cohort of premenopausal women with breast cancer, and highlighted the potential advantages of international medical exchange projects.Methods:Premenopausal women who underwent surgical treatment between 2012 and 2016 at one Italian and one Chinese institution participating in a medical exchange program were compared. Factors associated with the probability to receive mastectomy were determined via logistic analysis. Changes in surgical management at the Chinese institution in the period 2018-2019, after the exchange program, were also evaluated.Results:A total of 505 patients, 318 from Italy and 187 from China, were evaluated. The Chinese patients had more frequently advanced-stage tumours, large tumour size (30.9 vs. 18.1 mm,p< 0.01), invasive carcinoma (92.5 vs. 83.3%,p< 0.01), positive axillary lymph nodes (54.5 vs. 27.4%,p< 0.01), Her-2 positivity (36.4 vs. 22.0%,p< 0.01), and high proliferative index (55.1 vs. 30.2%,p< 0.01). Positive oestrogen receptor status and rates of triple-negative breast cancer did not differ (77.0 vs. 69.5%,p= 0.09 and 14.2 vs. 16%,p= 0.56, respectively). Mastectomy rates were higher among Chinese women (85 vs. 41%,p< 0.001), whereas use of sentinel node biopsy was more frequent among Italian women (77 vs. 33%,p< 0.001). Chinese women had more than 4-fold higher risk of receiving mastectomy. In the last 2 years, the rates of breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy at the Chinese institution increased from 15 to 23%, and from 33 to 42%, respectively.Conclusions:Tumour features and surgical strategies for premenopausal breast cancer may differ signi?cantly between Italy and China. Since the international exchange program, patients from the Chinese institution have been offered more frequently less invasive surgery. International exchange programs can help in designing epidemiological studies which may be useful for strategies to improve breast cancer management and control.

TI  - Assessing Agricultural Vulnerability to Drought in a Heterogeneous Environment: A Remote Sensing-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is one of the fundamental economic activities in most countries; however, this sector suffers from various natural hazards including flood and drought. The determination of drought-prone areas is essential to select drought-tolerant crops in climate sensitive vulnerable areas. This study aims to enhance the detection of agricultural areas with vulnerability to drought conditions in a heterogeneous environment, taking Bangladesh as a case study. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images have been incorporated to compute the vegetation index. In this study, a modified vegetation condition index (mVCI) is proposed to enhance the estimation of agricultural drought. The NDVI values ranging between 0.44 to 0.66 for croplands are utilized for the mVCI. The outcomes of the mVCI are compared with the traditional vegetation condition index (VCI). Precipitation and crop yield data are used for the evaluation. The mVCI maps from multiple years (2006-2018) have been produced to compute the drought hazard index (DHI) using a weighted sum overlay method. The results show that the proposed mVCI enhances the detection of agricultural drought compared to the traditional VCI in a heterogeneous environment. The "Aus" rice-growing season (sown in mid-March to mid-April and harvested in mid-July to early August) receives the highest average precipitation (>400 mm), and thereby this season is less vulnerable to drought. A comparison of crop yields reveals the lowest productivity in the drought year (2006) compared to the non-drought year (2018), and the DHI map presents that the north-west region of Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to agricultural drought. This study has undertaken a large-scale analysis that is important to prioritize agricultural zones and initiate development projects based on the associated level of vulnerability.

TI  - Automatic Change Detection Using Unsupervised Saliency Guided Method with UAV and Aerial Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an unsupervised saliency guided change detection method using UAV and aerial imagery is proposed. Regions that are more different from other areas are salient, which make them more distinct. The existence of the substantial difference between two images makes saliency proper for guiding the change detection process. Change Vector Analysis (CVA), which has the capability of extracting of overall magnitude and direction of change from multi-spectral and temporal remote sensing data, is used for generating an initial difference image. Combined with an unsupervised CVA and the saliency, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is possible to implemented as the guide for change detection method, is proposed for UAV and aerial images. By implementing the saliency generation on the difference map extracted via the CVA, potentially changed areas obtained, and by thresholding the saliency map, most of the interest areas correctly extracted. Finally, the PCA method is implemented to extract features, and K-means clustering is applied to detect changed and unchanged map on the extracted areas. This proposed method is applied to the image sets over the flooded and typhoon-damaged area and is resulted in 95 percent better than the PCA approach compared with manually extracted ground truth for all the data sets. Finally, we compared our approach with the PCA K-means method to show the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - CORONA High-Resolution Satellite and Aerial Imagery for Change Detection Assessment of Natural Hazard Risk and Urban Growth in El Alto/La Paz in Bolivia, Santiago de Chile, Yungay in Peru, Qazvin in Iran, and Mount St. Helens in the USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth and natural hazard events are continuous trends and reliable monitoring is demanded by organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, or the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. CORONA is the program name of photoreconnaissance satellite imagery available from 1960 to 1984 provides an extension of monitoring ranges in comparison to later satellite data such as Landsat that are more widely used. Providing visual comparisons with aerial or high-resolution OrbView satellite imagery, this article demonstrates applications of CORONA images for change detection of urban growth and sprawl and natural hazard exposure. Cases from El Alto/ La Paz in Bolivia, Santiago de Chile, Yungay in Peru, Qazvin in Iran, and Mount St. Helens in the USA are analysed. After a preassessment of over 20 disaster events, the 1970 Yungay earthquake-triggered debris avalanche and the natural hazard processes of the 1980 Mt St. Helens volcanic eruption are further analysed. Usability and limitations of CORONA data are analysed, including the availability of data depending on flight missions, cloud cover, spatial and temporal resolution, but also rather scarce documentation of natural hazards in the 1960s and 70s. Results include the identification of urban borders expanding into hazard-prone areas such as mountains, riverbeds or erosion channels. These are important areas for future research, making more usage of this valuable but little-used data source. The article addresses geographers, spatial planners, political decision makers and other scientific areas dealing with remote sensing.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon neoplasm in the breast (less than 0.1%). ACC is typically triple negative with a favourable prognosis. Its low frequency and indolent course cause difficulties in the agreement of the evaluation and therapeutic consensus, as well as the use of the sentinel node excision in these carcinomas.OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to provide a new series of cases from the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, through retrospective review over a period of 22 years.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Every case of breast ACC diagnosed between 1998-2020 is reviewed. We analyze the clinical and pathological characteristics, and compare them with the literature.RESULTS: We identified twelve cases of ACC, from a total of 18,241 patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma, with an average tumor size of 23.8mm and mean of 63.5 years. All of them were in a stage I-II at diagnosis. One case presented a lymph node micrometastases. One of them presented local recurrences and one case presented metastases 5 months after diagnosis (93.5 months of mean follow-up). According to Nottingham Histological Score, eight cases had a grade 1, two grade 2 and two grade 3. According to the classification of Ro et al., three were grade 1, four grade 2 and five grade 3. One case was ER positive (10%). No case presents positivity for BRAF-V600E in immunohistochemistry.CONCLUSION: The management and prognosis ACC of breast, within benignity, remains uncertain, with more studies being needed to understand the clinical evolution and perform adequate therapeutic management.

TI  - Designing a Validation Protocol for Remote Sensing Based Operational Forest Masks Applications. Comparison of Products Across Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal dynamics of the forest cover can be captured using remote sensing data. Forest masks are a valuable tool to monitor forest characteristics, such as biomass, deforestation, health condition and disturbances. This study was carried out under the umbrella of the EC H2020 MySustainableForest (MSF) project. A key achievement has been the development of supervised classification methods for delineating forest cover. The forest masks presented here are binary forest/non-forest classification maps obtained using Sentinel-2 data for 16 study areas across Europe with different forest types. Performance metrics can be selected to measure accuracy of forest mask. However, large-scale reference datasets are scarce and typically cannot be considered as ground truth. In this study, we implemented a stratified random sampling system and the generation of a reference dataset based on visual interpretation of satellite images. This dataset was used for validation of the forest masks, MSF and two other similar products: HRL by Copernicus and FNF by the DLR. MSF forest masks showed a good performance (OA(MSF) = 96.3%; DCMSF = 96.5), with high overall accuracy (88.7-99.5%) across all the areas, and omission and commission errors were low and balanced (OEMSF = 2.4%; CEMSF = 4.5%; relB(MSF) = 2%), while the other products showed on average lower accuracies (OA(HRL) = 89.2%; OA(FNF) = 76%). However, for all three products, the Mediterranean areas were challenging to model, where the complexity of forest structure led to relatively high omission errors (OEMSF = 9.5%; OEHRL = 59.5%; OEFNF = 71.4%). Comparing these results with the vision from external local stakeholders highlighted the need of establishing clear large-scale validation datasets and protocols for remote sensing-based forest products. Future research will be done to test the MSF mask in forest types not present in Europe and compare new outputs to available reference datasets.

AB  - Fernandez-Fernandez, J, Garcia-Tormo, V, Santos-Rosa, FJ, Teixeira, AS, Nakamura, FY, Granacher, U, and Sanz-Rivas, D. The effect of a neuromuscular vs. dynamic warm-up on physical performance in young tennis players.J Strength Cond Res34(10): 2776-2784, 2020-The aim of this study was to examine performance-enhancing (i.e., training) effects of a neuromuscular warm-up (NWU) compared with a dynamic WU (DWU) in young tennis players. Twenty-eight well-trained male tennis players with a mean age of 15.09 +/- 1.16 years participated in this study and were assigned to either a training group performing NWU (n= 14), or a group that followed DWU (n= 15) before tennis-specific training, for 8 weeks. Pretest and posttest included: speed (5, 10, and 20 m); modified 5-0-5 change of direction (COD) test; bilateral/unilateral countermovement jump (CMJ); 2 kg overhead, forehand, and backhand-side medicine ball throw performance (MBT); serve velocity, and shoulder strength and range-of-motion (ROM) performance (i.e., internal [IR]/external [ER] rotation). Results showed that both groups, NWU and DWU, significantly improved their sprint performances (5-20 m; [p< 0.05;d= 0.83-1.32]), CMJ (bilateral and unilateral [dominant side] [p< 0.005;d= 1.27-1.59]), overhead MBT (p= 0.014;d= 1.02), and some shoulder strength (i.e., IR dominant side [D], ER D, ER/IR ratio [p< 0.05;d= 0.86-1.59]) and ROM (i.e., ER D, total ROM D [p< 0.05;d= 0.80-1.02]) values. However, the interaction effects revealed that NWU compared with DWU produced greater performance gains in most of the analyzed parameters (i.e., 5-10 m sprint, CMJ, overhead MBT, serve speed). The inclusion of an NWU characterized by a relatively low volume (similar to 20-35 minutes), including general mobility, core, and shoulder strength exercises, combined with neuromuscular-related exercises (e.g., plyometric and acceleration/deceleration/COD drills), can be recommended to obtain positive effects in tennis performance-related variables.

TI  - DYNAMICS OF SANDY SPITS IN NORTHERN FLANK OF THE PARAIBA DO SUL RIVER DELTA (RJ) BETWEEN 1984 E 2017
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paraiba do Sul river delta has typical characteristics associated with asymmetric deltas dominated by waves. Of these features, the sandy spits that occur in the north of the delta are of particular importance to the evolution of the delta plain. The most recent formation and evolution model describes the occurrence of regular cycles of emersion, growth and assimilation of the plains of these sandy spits. However, several works claim that the morphodynamics of delta mouths has a non-linear or irregular character. In view of this, the present work aims to analyze the sandy spit evolution on the north coast of the Paraiba do Sul River based on images from the LANDSAT historical series, leakage data and oscillation indexes of the waters of the South Pacific (SOI). For this purpose, geomorphological mapping of the study area, leak data analysis and oscillation indexes of the waters of the South Pacific (SOI) were carried out. The results obtained showed several periods of expansion, growth and connection to the plain and erosion of spits, suggesting the occurrence of short and non-linear cycles of evolution. The results showed a possible relationship between the periods of rework of the sandy spits with the dry seasons and the occurrence of the La Nina phenomenon.

TI  - Monitoring conifer cover: Leaf-off lidar and image-based tracking of eastern redcedar encroachment in central Nebraska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) encroachment on the Great Plains has led to decreases in biodiversity, water availability, and grazing land while increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Quantifying the current spatial distribution of eastern redcedar can aid land management efforts to combat encroachment, and extending this information over time can improve our understanding of the patterns and drivers of encroachment. We compared several remote sensing methods for mapping percent conifer cover to develop an approach that would be applicable for monitoring eastern redcedar encroachment across the Great Plains to support management goals. Leaf-off lidar was filtered through a novel approach using normalized return intensity and local canopy density to remove residual points pertaining to deciduous trees, which enabled us to calculate percent conifer cover. A sample of the conifer cover derived from leaf-off lidar was then used to test passive imagery-based methods that could be applied over a greater spatiotemporal extent. These imagery-based methods included Spatial Wavelet Analysis applied to very high-resolution imagery and random forest regression modeling with Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 based predictive layers generated in Google Earth Engine from a single image, seasonal composites, and harmonic regression coefficients produced from an annual time series. Spatial Wavelet Analysis provided high accuracy (similar to 5% RMSE) in areas where conifer cover was less than 10%, but accuracy rapidly decreased with increases in observed cover such that this method had a very low overall accuracy (42.5% RMSE). Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 based predictors yielded similar performance to each other in models of conifer cover (9.7 to 13.3% RMSE), but seasonal composites from either sensor provided higher predictive power than either use of a single winter image or harmonic regression coefficients. According to recent estimates from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, eastern redcedar comprises more than 90% of conifer basal area in 277 counties of the central Great Plains, and thus mapping conifer cover can be assumed to reflect eastern redcedar cover. By applying the LandTrendr algorithm to Landsat seasonal composites we produced stable estimates of eastern redcedar cover from 1984 to 2018 and quantified encroachment as a 2.3% per year increase in eastern redcedar forest, defined as areas with >= 10% redcedar cover. The comparison of these methods and their application through time lays the groundwork for monitoring of redcedar encroachment across the central Great Plains and provides an approach for mapping fractional cover of conifer trees more generally.

TI  - Lowland Rice Mapping in Sedhiou Region (Senegal) Using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 Data and Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In developing countries, information on the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice fields is an essential requirement for ensuring food security and facilitating targeted actions of both technical assistance and restoration of degraded production areas. In this study, Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) imagery was used to map lowland rice crop areas in the Sedhiou region (Senegal) for the 2017, 2018, and 2019 growing seasons using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Ground sample datasets were annually collected (416, 455, and 400 samples) for training and testing yearly RF classification. A procedure was preliminarily applied to process S2 scenes and yield a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series less affected by clouds. A total of 93 predictors were calculated from S2 NDVI time series and S1 vertical transmit-horizontal receive (VH) and vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) backscatters. Guided regularized random forest (GRRF) was used to deal with the arising multicollinearity and identify the most important predictors. The RF classifier was then applied to the selected predictors. The algorithm predicted the five land cover types present in the test areas, with a maximum accuracy of 87% and kappa coefficient of 0.8 in 2019. The broad land cover maps identified around 12,500 (2017), 13,800 (2018), and 12,800 (2019) ha of lowland rice crops. The study highlighted a partial difficulty of the classifier to distinguish rice from natural herbaceous vegetation (NHV) due to similar temporal patterns and high intra-class variability. Moreover, the results of this investigation indicated that S2-derived predictors provided more valuable information compared to VV and VH backscatter-derived predictors, but a combination of radar and optical imagery always outperformed a classification based on single-sensor inputs. An example is finally provided that illustrates how the maps obtained can be combined with ground observations through a ratio estimator in order to yield a statistically sound prediction of rice area all over the study region.

TI  - Molecular Blood Group Screening in Donors from Arabian Countries and Iran Using High-Throughput MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and PCR-SSP
T2  - TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND HEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims:Only little is known about blood groups other than ABO blood groups and Rhesus factors in Arabian countries and Iran. During the last years, increased migration to Central Europe has put a focus on the question how to guarantee blood supply for patients from these countries, particularly because hemoglobinopathies with the need of regular blood support are more frequent in patients from that region. Therefore, blood group allele frequencies should be determined in individuals from Arabian countries and Iran by molecular typing and compared to a German rare donor panel.Methods:1,111 samples including 800 individuals from Syria, 147 from Iran, 123 from the Arabian Peninsula, and 41 from Northern African countries were included in a MALDI-TOF MS assay to detect polymorphisms coding for Kk, Fy(a/b), Fy(null), C-w, Jk(a/b), Jo(a+/a-), Lu(a/b), Lu(8/14), Ss, Do(a/b), Co(a/b), In(a/b), Js(a/b), Kp(a/b), and variant allelesRHCE*c.697C>GandRHCE*c.733C>G. Yt(a/b), S-s-U-, Vel(null), Co-null, andRHCE*c.667G>Twere tested by PCR-SSP.Results:Of the Arabian donors, 2% were homozygous for theFY*02.01Nallele (Fy(null)), and 15.7% carried the heterozygous mutation. However, 0.8% of the German donors also carried 1 copy of the allele. 3.6% of all and 29.3% of Northern African donors were heterozygous for theRHCE*c.733C>Gsubstitution, 0.4% of the Syrian probands were heterozygous forDO*01/DO*01.-05, a genotype that was lacking in German donors. Whereas theKEL*02.06allele coding for the Js(a) phenotype was missing in Germans; 0.8% of the Syrian donors carried 1 copy of this allele. 1.8% of the Syrian but only 0.3% of the German donors were negative forYT*01. One donor from Northern Africa homo-zygously carried theGYPB*270+5g>tmutation, inducing the S-s-U+(w) phenotype, and in 2 German donors aGYPB*c.161G>Aexchange, which induces the Mit+ phenotype, caused aGYPB*03allele dropout in the MALDI assay. The overall failure rate of the Arabian panel was 0.4%.Conclusions:Some blood group alleles that are largely lacking in Europeans but had been described in African individuals are present in Arabian populations at a somewhat lower frequency. In single cases, it could be challenging to provide immunized Arabian patients with compatible blood.

TI  - Performance of chlorophyll prediction indices for<i>Eragrostis tef</i>at Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI spectral resolutions
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As remotely sensed data becomes more readily available around the world, satellites such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 have great potential to support precision agriculture. Sensors with high spectral and spatial resolutions are particularly optimal for limited land resource farmers to improve land management. The objective of this short communication is to assess the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multispectral bands for chlorophyll prediction using indices that were originally developed using imaging spectroscopy/hyperspectral data. Remotely sensed chlorophyll content measures are often utilized as a proxy of plant health. Performance of a group of chlorophyll prediction indices is tested for tef (Eragrostis tef), an endemic grass crop native to Ethiopia that forms a major component of Ethiopian diets and is grown by limited land resource farmers. Hyperspectral reflectance data captured in situ at the canopy level were convolved into bands approximating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors, and a suite of chlorophyll prediction indices were computed and regressed against chlorophyll content. Results show that simple pigment indices employing wavelengths corresponding to the blue and ultra-blue bands performed best for predicting chlorophyll. The red-edge index computed using the Sentinel-2 bands also performed well. These findings suggest that publicly available, multispectral imagery can potentially substitute for hyperspectral data in chlorophyll prediction indices, thereby improving the accessibility of precision agriculture methods.

TI  - Automatic Extraction and Filtering of OpenStreetMap Data to Generate Training Datasets for Land Use Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper tests an automated methodology for generating training data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to classify Sentinel-2 imagery into Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classes. Different sets of training data were generated and used as inputs for the image classification. Firstly, OSM data was converted into LULC maps using the OSM2LULC_4T software package. The Random Forest classifier was then trained to classify a time-series of Sentinel-2 imagery into 8 LULC classes with samples extracted from: (1) The LULC maps produced by OSM2LULC_4T (TD0); (2) the TD1 dataset, obtained after removing mixed pixels from TD0; (3) the TD2 dataset, obtained by filtering TD1 using radiometric indices. The classification results were generalized using a majority filter and hybrid maps were created by merging the classification results with the OSM2LULC outputs. The accuracy of all generated maps was assessed using the 2018 official "Carta de Ocupacao do Solo" (COS). The methodology was applied to two study areas with different characteristics. The results show that in some cases the filtering procedures improve the training data and the classification results. This automated methodology allowed the production of maps with overall accuracy between 55% and 78% greater than that of COS, even though the used nomenclature includes classes that can be easily confused by the classifiers.

TI  - Estimating wave attenuation at the coastal land margin with a GIS toolbox
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave attenuation is a key process that impacts activities at the coastal land margin and is an ecosystem service provided by many natural landscapes. Traditional modeling tools for wind wave attenuation require advanced expertise to apply. We present an alternative, GIS-based option for estimating wave attenuation, the Wave Attenuation Toolbox (WATTE). The outputs are a map of wave height transmission as a percentage of the original wave height and a line demarking the extent of wave exposure onshore. WATTE supports a variety of inputs, ranging from outputs of ecological and landscape evolution models to remote sensing data, and past, present, and future conditions can be analyzed. The present version of WATTE models wave attenuation as an exponential decay process, and a recommendation table for exponential decay constants is derived from previous studies. Three examples of applying WATTE to marsh environments are described.

TI  - The Continuity MODIS-VIIRS Cloud Mask
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces the Continuity Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Cloud Mask (MVCM), a cloud detection algorithm designed to facilitate continuity in cloud detection between the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on the Aqua and Terra platforms and the series of VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instruments, beginning with the Soumi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) spacecraft. It is based on the MODIS cloud mask that has been operating since 2000 with the launch of the Terra spacecraft (MOD35) and continuing in 2002 with Aqua (MYD35). The MVCM makes use of fourteen spectral bands that are common to both MODIS and VIIRS so as to create consistent cloud detection between the two instruments and across the years 2000-2020 and beyond. Through comparison data sets, including collocated Aqua MODIS and Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) from the A-Train, this study was designed to assign statistical consistency benchmarks between the MYD35 and MVCM cloud masks. It is shown that the MVCM produces consistent cloud detection results between Aqua MODIS, SNPP VIIRS, and NOAA-20 VIIRS and that the quality is comparable to the standard Aqua MODIS cloud mask. Globally, comparisons with collocated CALIOP lidar show combined clear and cloudy sky hit rates of 88.2%, 87.5%, 86.8%, and 86.8% for MYD35, MVCM Aqua MODIS, MVCM SNPP VIIRS, and MVCM NOAA-20 VIIRS, respectively, for June through until August, 2018. For the same months and in the same order for 60S-60N, hit rates are 90.7%, 90.5%, 90.1%, and 90.3%. From the time series constructed from gridded daily means of 60S-60N cloud fractions, we found that the mean day-to-day cloud fraction differences/standard deviations in percent to be 0.68/0.55, 0.94/0.64, -0.20/0.50, and 0.44/0.82 for MVCM Aqua MODIS-MVCM SNPP VIIRS day and night, and MVCM NOAA-20 VIIRS-MVCM SNPP VIIRS day and night, respectively. It is seen that the MODIS and VIIRS 1.38 mu m cirrus detection bands perform similarly but with MODIS detecting slightly more clouds in the middle to high levels of the troposphere and the VIIRS detecting more in the upper troposphere above 16 km. In the Arctic, MVCM Aqua MODIS and SNPP VIIRS reported cloud fraction differences of 0-3% during the mid-summer season and -3-4% during the mid-winter.

TI  - Excess Out-of-Hospital Mortality and Declining Oxygen Saturation: The Sentinel Role of Emergency Medical Services Data in the COVID-19 Crisis in Tijuana, Mexico
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: Emergency medical services (EMS) may serve as a key source of real-time data about the evolving health of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-affected populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries with less rapid and reliable vital statistics registration systems. Although official COVID-19 statistics in Mexico report almost exclusively inhospital mortality events, excess out-of-hospital mortality has been identified in other countries, including 1 EMS study in Italy that showed a 58% increase. Additionally, EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia-low Spo(2) in the absence of dyspnea-is associated with COVID-19. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to low-and middle-income countries. We assess how EMS data can be used in a sentinel capacity in Tijuana, a city on the Mexico-United States border with earlier exposure to COVID-19 than many low- and middle-income country settings.Methods: In this observational study, we calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases handled by EMS in Tijuana, and estimated the difference between peak epidemic rates and expected trends based on data from 2014 to 2019. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status, and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean Spo(2).Results: An estimated 194.7 excess out-of-hospital deaths (95% confidence interval 135.5 to 253.9 deaths) occurred during the peak window (April 14 to May 11), representing an increase of 145% (95% CI 70% to 338%) compared with expected levels. During the same window, only 5 COVID-19-related out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with an increase in respiratory cases of 236.5% (95% CI 100.7% to 940.0%) and a decrease in mean Spo(2) to 77.7% from 90.2% at baseline. The highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-socioeconomic-status areas, although respiratory cases were more concentrated in high-socioeconomic-status areas.Conclusion: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in low- and middle-income countries. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly 3-fold greater than increases reported in EMS data in Italy. Increased testing in out-of-hospital settings may be required to determine whether excess mortality is being driven by COVID-19 infection, health system saturation, or patient avoidance of health care. We also found evidence of worsening rates of hypoxemia among respiratory patients treated by EMS, suggesting a possible increase in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.

TI  - Casting Aside the Clutches of Conjecture: the Striving for Religious Certainty at Aligarh
T2  - ISLAMIC LAW AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Why did the famous North Indian modernist and founder of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh, Sayyid Aftmad Khan (d.1315/1898), lash out against emulation (taqlid) in Islamic law (fiqh)? The usual explanation is that he wanted to shift religious authority away from the religious scholars ('ulama') toward ordinary Muslims. Countering this claim, I argue that his goal and that of his followers and associates at Aligarh was not primarily to 'democratize' Islamic knowledge by doing away with the traditional edifice of Islamic law in general and the four established Sunni legal schools in particular. Rather, Sayyid Afimad Khan and his associates attacked taqlid because, in their view, it failed to yield reliable, certain knowledge (yaqin). Drawing on Urdu writings, I demonstrate that these modernist thinkers did not engage with the inner logic of Islamic law but rather measured it according to higher, theological, and philosophical standards. In their quest for certainty, they were inspired both by a scientific worldview as well as colonial conceptions of law.

TI  - Manual-Based Improvement Method for the ASTER Global Water Body Data Base
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A water body detection technique is an essential part of digital elevation model (DEM) generation to delineate land-water boundaries and to set flattened elevations. The initial tile-based water body data that are created during production of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) GDEM, as a by-product, are incorporated into ASTER GDEM V3 to improve the quality. At the same time as ASTER GDEM V3, the Global Water Body Data Base (ASTWBD) Version 1 is also released to the public. The ASTWBD generation consists of two parts: separation from land area, and classification into three categories: sea, lake, and river. Sea water bodies have zero elevation. Lake water bodies have flattened elevations. River water bodies have a gradual step-down from upstream to downstream with a step of one meter. The separation process from land area is carried out automatically using an algorithm, except for sea-ice removal, to delineate the real seashore lines in the high latitude areas; almost all of the water bodies are created through this process. The classification process into three categories, i.e., sea, river, and lake, is carried out, and incorporated into ASTER GDEM V3. For inland water bodies, it is not possible to perfectly detect all water bodies using reflectance and spectral index, which are the only available parameters for optical sensors. The only way available to identify the undetected inland water bodies is to manually copy them with visual inspection from the earth's surface images, like Landsat images. GeoCover2000 images are the main part of the object images. Color-Land ASTER MosaicS (CLAMS) images are used to cover the deficiency of the GeoCover2000 images. This kind of time-consuming, unsophisticated way is inevitable as it is a manual-based method to improve the quality of the ASTWBD. This paper describes the manual-based improvement method; specifically, how deficient water body images are efficiently copied as rasterized images from the earth's surface images to obtain a more complete global water body data set.

TI  - Simulation of Sentinel-2 Bottom of Atmosphere Reflectance Using Shadow Parameters on a Deciduous Forest in Thailand
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The shadow fraction of the canopy is an important factor in Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and in estimating physical quantities, such as tree height and biomass. Shadows are used as a shielding ratio for direct solar irradiance, but, at shorter wavelengths, the amount of diffuse solar irradiance is greater, so the shielding ratio cannot be ignored. The shielding ratio of direct and diffuse solar irradiance is called Cast Shadow (CS) and Self Cast Shadow (SCS), respectively; however, it has been pointed out that the effect of these shadows is greater at higher resolutions, such as Sentinel-2. In addition, the Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance is greatly affected by shadows, because it is corrected for atmospheric effects. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial variability of CS and SCS and simulate the Sentinel-2BOA reflectance with these shadows. The target forest was a greenness season of a deciduous broadleaf forest in Thailand. First, we obtained a point cloud of the forest by Structure from Motion while using the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Next, we created a voxel model with CS and SCS as attributes. CS was calculated as the percentage of area where the plane that is assumed per voxel is shielded from direct solar irradiance by other voxels. SCS was calculated as the percentage of area where the hemispheric radiant environment is shielded by other voxels. Subsequently, using solar irradiance and leaf spectral reflectance data, the reflectance of each band of Sentinel-2 was simulated. Nine leaves were used to investigate the effect of leaf species on the simulation. The reflectance acquired by Sentinel-2 is not at the leaf level; however, we used this spectral reflectance data because the reflectance was simulated at the same spatial resolution as the voxel size. Voxel sizes of 20 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm were used. Our result showed that (1) the spatial variability of SCS was smaller than that of CS when the sun position is fixed and the view zenith angle is changed. SCS was mostly 0.12 at different zenith angles, while the CS had a maximum value of 0.45 and a minimum value of 0.15. (2) The accuracy of the simulations was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The best RMSE is 0.020 +/- 0.015 and the worst one is 0.084 +/- 0.044. It was found that the error is larger in short wavelength infrared bands. (3) In this forest, the relative reflectance changed only about 1.2 times as much, as the voxel size was increased from 20 cm to 200 cm. In this study, we have simulated a single Sentinel-2 image. In the future, we will simulate multi-temporal images in order to investigate the effects of phenology and shadow changes on the reflectance that was observed by optical sensors.

TI  - QCam: sUAS-Based Doppler Radar for Measuring River Discharge
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey is actively investigating remote sensing of surface velocity and river discharge (discharge) from satellite-, high altitude-, small, unmanned aircraft systems- (sUAS or drone), and permanent (fixed) deployments. This initiative is important in ungaged basins and river reaches that lack the infrastructure to deploy conventional streamgaging equipment. By coupling alternative discharge algorithms with sensors capable of measuring surface velocity, streamgage networks can be established in regions where data collection was previously impractical or impossible. To differentiate from satellite or high-altitude platforms, near-field remote sensing is conducted from sUAS or fixed platforms. QCam is a Doppler (velocity) radar mounted and integrated on a 3DR (c) Solo sUAS. It measures the along-track surface velocity by spot dwelling in a river cross section at a vertical where the maximum surface velocity is recorded. The surface velocity is translated to a mean-channel (mean) velocity using the probability concept (PC), and discharge is computed using the PC-derived mean velocity and cross-sectional area. Factors including surface-scatterer quality, flight altitude, propwash, wind drift, and sample duration may affect the radar-returns and the subsequent computation of mean velocity and river discharge. To evaluate the extensibility of the method, five science flights were conducted on four rivers of varying size and dynamics and included the Arkansas River, Colorado (CO), USA (two events); Salcha River near Salchaket, Alaska (AK), USA; South Platte River, CO, USA; and the Tanana River, AK, USA. QCam surface velocities and river discharges were compared to conventional streamgaging methods, which represented truth. QCam surface velocities for the Arkansas River, Salcha River, South Platte River, and Tanana River were 1.02 meters per second (m/s) and 1.43 m/s; 1.58 m/s; 0.90 m/s; and 2.17 m/s, respectively. QCam discharges (and percent differences) were 9.48 (0.3%) and 20.3 cubic meters per second (m(3)/s) (2.5%); 62.1 m(3)/s (-10.4%); 3.42 m(3)/s (7.3%), and 1579 m(3)/s (-18.8%). QCam results compare favorably with conventional streamgaging and are a viable near-field remote sensing technology that can be operationalized to deliver real-time surface velocity, mean velocity, and river discharge, if cross-sectional area is available.

TI  - Towards elimination of childhood and adolescent tuberculosis in the Netherlands: an epidemiological time-series analysis of national surveillance data
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) in children and adolescents is a sentinel event for ongoing transmission. In the Netherlands, epidemiological characteristics of childhood and adolescent TB have not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to assess TB epidemiology within this population to provide guidance for TB elimination.Methods: A retrospective time-series analysis using national surveillance data from 1993-2018 was performed in children (aged <15 years) and adolescents (aged 15-19 years) with TB. Poisson regression models offset with log-population size were used to estimate notification rates and rate ratios. Trends in notification rates were estimated using average annual percentage changes (AAPC) based on the segmented linear regression analysis.Results: Among 3899 children and adolescents with TB notified during 1993-2018, 2418 (62%) were foreign-born (725 (41.3%) out of 1755 children and 1693 (78.9%) out of 2144 adolescents). The overall notification rate in children was 2.3 per 100 000 person-years, declining steadily during the study period (AAPC -10.9%, 95% CI -12.6--9.1). In adolescents, the overall notification rate was 8.4 per 100 000 person-years, strongly increasing during 1993-2001 and 2012-2018. Compared to Dutch-born children and adolescents, substantially higher notification rates were observed among African-born children and adolescents (116.8 and 316.6 per 100 000 person-years, respectively). Additionally, an increasing trend was observed in African-born adolescents (AAPC 18.5%, 95% CI 11.9-25.5). Among the foreign-born population, those from countries in the horn of Africa contributed most to the TB caseload.Conclusion: TB notification rate among children was low and constantly declining across different demographic groups. However, heterogeneities were shown in adolescents, with an increasing trend in the foreign-born, particularly those from Africa.

TI  - A Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana: Applying deep learning to shallow mining
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal Small-scale Mining (ASM) is a critical source of livelihoods for large areas of the Global South but it can bring with it many problems, including deforestation, water pollution and low worker safety. Timely and comprehensive management of ASM is crucial to ensure that it can take place safely and cleanly, supporting sustainable development. The informal nature of the sector presents challenges related to documenting the locations of ASM. Remote sensing methods have been used to detect ASM, although difficulties with accuracy, resolution and persistent cloud cover have been encountered. This paper proposes a method of ASM detection using a deep convolutional neural network model applied to open source Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery. Firstly, the model is evaluated against both existing ASM detection methods and visual inspection of randomly sampled points. Secondly, the model is used to map mining and urban land use changes over a dataset spanning four years and 6 million hectares of southern Ghana, demonstrating the ability of this method to process very large areas.The omission and commission errors of less than 8% from the sampled points indicate that this model has achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy for the task of detecting ASM from satellite imagery. When applied to the case study area, the data on ASM trends over time demonstrate a correlation between the Ghanaian government's 2017 clampdown and ASM activities. The ASM land use category decreased by 6000 ha in 2017, despite a net increase of 15000 ha over the period 2015-2019. Additionally, the model was applied to quantify the extent of illegal mining related deforestation within Ghana's protected forests, measured at over 3500 ha, with 2400 of these lost since 2015. The results demonstrate that this methodology can detect ASM in Ghana with a high degree of accuracy at a minimal cost in terms of financial and human resources. The model shows strong generalisation abilities, offering exciting potential for using this methodology to further monitor and analyse ASM related land use changes worldwide.

TI  - Improving Water Leaving Reflectance Retrievals from ABI and AHI Data Acquired Over Case 2 Waters from Present Geostationary Weather Satellite Platforms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current generation of geostationary weather satellite instruments, such as the Advanced Baseline Imagers (ABIs) on board the US NOAA GOES 16 and 17 satellites and the Advanced Himawari Imagers (AHIs) on board the Japanese Himawari-8/9 satellites, have six channels located in the visible to shortwave IR (SWIR) spectral range. These instruments can acquire images over both land and water surfaces at spatial resolutions between 0.5 and 2 km and with a repeating cycle between 5 and 30 min depending on the mode of operation. The imaging data from these instruments have clearly demonstrated the capability in detecting sediment movements over coastal waters and major chlorophyll blooms over deeper oceans. At present, no operational ocean color data products have been produced from ABI data. Ocean color data products have been operationally generated from AHI data at the Japan Space Agency, but the spatial coverage of the products over very turbid coastal waters are sometimes lacking. In this article, we describe atmospheric correction algorithms for retrieving water leaving reflectances from ABI and AHI data using spectrum-matching techniques. In order to estimate aerosol models and optical depths, we match simultaneously the satellite-measured top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectances on the pixel by pixel basis for three channels centered near 0.86, 1.61, and 2.25 mu m (or any combinations of two channels among the three channels) with theoretically simulated TOA reflectances. We demonstrate that water leaving reflectance retrievals can be made from ABI and AHI data with our algorithms over turbid case two waters. Our spectrum-matching algorithms, if implemented onto operational computing facilities, can be complimentary to present operational ocean versions of atmospheric correction algorithms that are mostly developed based on the SeaWiFS type of two-band ratio algorithm.

TI  - Characteristics and driving forces of wetland landscape pattern evolution of the city belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, with functions of water purification, climate regulation, and carbon sinks. Due to the stresses caused by human social development and changes of natural conditions, wetlands have been seriously damaged. We examined the evolutionary law of landscape pattern of wetland along the Yellow River, and acquainted the current situation of wetland resources and dynamic change. Based on satellite images of year 2000, 2009, and 2018 from Landsat, we used landscape indices and geographic detectors to quantitatively analyze the characteristics and driving forces of wetland landscape pattern evolution of the city belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that the wetland area of the city belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia enlarged first and then decreased from 2000 to 2018. The wetland area increased by 52.2 km(2) in the early stage of the study with an increasing rate of 8.2%, and decreased by 26.8 km(2) with a reduction rate of 3.9% in the later stage. The wetland was mainly transformed to construction land and unused land, with transfer out area being 166.7 and 158.4 km(2) respectively. New wetland was mainly transformed from unused land, forest, and grassland, with an area of 543.1 km(2). The fragmentation degree of wetland landscape in city belt was increasing, the balanced distribution of all kinds of wetlands was gradually strengthened, the landscape diversity was increasing, and the dominant landscape types were gradually weakening. Natural factors and socio-economic factors jointly affected the evolution of wetland landscape pattern in city belt. Among all socio-economic factors population was the most important one. Among natural factors , precipitation and temperature were important. Other driving factors were relatively weak , but could not be ignored.

TI  - ANTARCTIC VEGETATION, A SENTINEL TO CLIMATE CHANGE
T2  - Anales de la Real Academia Nacional de Farmacia
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica is the coldest, driest, highest and windiest continent ; the lichens and mosses grow where it is more warm, wet, low and protected Overall productivity is strongly influenced by the length of period when water is available and the plants become, therefore, increasingly confined to areas of exceptionally good microclimate. It is this strong link between microclimate, water availability and productivity/growth that makes the system so potentially useful for monitoring global climate change, especially temperature increase. Even a small increase in temperature will markedly alter the areas over which such warm periods occur and bring with it a marked community shift. It is becoming clear that there are two Antarcticas, the Peninsula and the main continent. These differ in the controls on biodiversity distribution, there is a probably water unlimited but temperature-determined biodiversity cline in the Peninsula compared to a, water controlled, temperature-independent, fragmented vegetation in the continent. The reverse diel pattern of activity with the presence of very high light stress also seems to be confined to the continent. Several attempts have been made to use lichens as monitors of climate change especially in alpine and polar regions. The pristine Antarctica offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of climate change along a latitudinal gradient that extends between 62 degrees and 87 degrees S. Both lichen species diversity and thallus growth rate seem to show significant correlations to mean annual temperature and precipitation for gradients across the continent as well as to short time climate oscillation in the Antarctic Peninsula. Competition interactions appear to be small so that individual thalli develop in balance with environmental conditions and, as a result, can indicate the trends in productivity for discrete time intervals over long periods of time in a climate warming scenario.

TI  - Evaluation of fire severity in fire prone-ecosystems of Spain under two different environmental conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe fires associated to climate change and land cover changes are becoming more frequent in Mediterranean Europe. The influence of environmental drivers on fire severity, especially under different environmental conditions is still not fully understood. In this study we aim to determine the main environmental variables that control fire severity in large fires (>500 ha) occurring in fire-prone ecosystems under two different environmental conditions following a transition (Mediterranean-Oceanic)-Mediterranean climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula, and to provide management recommendations to mitigate fire damage. We estimated fire severity as the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio, through images obtained from Landsat 8 OLI. We also examined the relative influence of pre-fire vegetation structure (vegetation composition and configuration), prefire weather conditions, fire history and topography on fire severity using Random Forest machine learning algorithms. The results indicated that the severity of fires occurring along the transition (MediterraneanOceanic)-Mediterranean climatic gradient was primarily controlled by pre-fire vegetation composition. Nevertheless, the effect of vegetation composition was strongly dependent on interactions with fire recurrence and prefire vegetation structural configuration. The relationship between fire severity, weather and topographic predictors was not consistent among fires occurring in the Mediterranean-Oceanic transition and Mediterranean sites. In the Mediterranean-Oceanic transition site, fire severity was determined by weather conditions (i.e., summer cumulative rainfall), rather than being associated to topography, suggesting that the control exerted by topography may be overwhelmed by weather controls. Conversely, results showed that topography only had a major effect on fire severity in the Mediterranean site. The results of this study highlight the need to prioritise fuel treatments aiming at breaking fuel continuity and reducing fuel loads as an effective management strategy to mitigate fire damage in areas of high fire recurrence.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Pasture Biomass Estimation Integrating Electronic Plate Meter, Planet CubeSats and Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a substantial opportunity to lift feed utilization and profitability on pasture-based dairy systems through both increased pasture monitoring accuracy and frequency. The first objective of this experiment was to determine the impact of the number of electronic rising plate meter (RPM) readings and walking pattern on the accuracy of the RPM to determine pasture biomass. The second objective was to evaluate current satellite technology (i.e., small CubeSats and traditional large satellites) in combination with the electronic RPM as an accurate tool for systematic pasture monitoring. The experiment was conducted from October to December 2019 at Camden, Australia. Two experimental paddocks, each of 1.1 ha, were sown with annual ryegrass and monitored with an electronic RPM integrated with Global Navigation Satellite System and with two different satellites (Planet CubeSats and Sentinel-2 satellite). Here we show that 70 RPM readings achieve a +/- 5% error in the pasture biomass estimations (kg DM/ha), with no effect of the walking pattern on accuracy. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellites showed a good correlation with pasture biomass estimated using the electronic RPM (R-2 0.74-0.94). Satellite pasture biomass and growth rate estimations were similar to RPM in one regrowth period but underestimated by approximate to 20% in the other. Our results also reveal that the accuracy of uncalibrated satellites (i.e., biomass estimated using NDVI to kg DM/ha standard equations) is low (R-2 0.61, RMSE 566-1307 kg DM/ha). However, satellites calibrated with a RPM showed greater accuracy in the estimations (R-2 0.72, RMSE 255 kg DM/ha). Current satellite technology, when used with the electronic RPM, has the potential to not only reduce the time required to monitor pasture biomass manually but provide finer scale measurements of pasture biomass within paddocks. Further work is required to test this hypothesis, both spatially and temporally.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Sensing-Based Irrigation Water Accounting at River Basin District Management Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Water Framework Directive in Europe requires extending metering and water abstraction controls to accurately satisfy the necessary water resource requirements. However, in situ measurement instruments are inappropriate for large irrigation surface areas, considering the high investment and maintenance service costs. In this study, Remote Sensing-based Irrigation Water Accounting (RS-IWA) (previously evaluated for commercial plots, water user associations, and groundwater water management scales) was applied to over 11 Spanish river basin districts during the period of 2014-2018. Using the FAO56 methodology and incorporating remote sensing basal crop coefficient time series to simulate the Remote Sensing-based Soil Water Balance (RS-SWB), we were able to provide spatially and temporally distributed net irrigation requirements. The results were evaluated against the irrigation water demands estimated by the Hydrological Planning Offices and published in the River Basin Management Plans applying the same spatial (Agricultural Demand Units and Exploitation Systems) and temporal (annual and monthly) water management scales used by these public water managers, ultimately returning ranges of agreement (r(2) and d(r)) (Willmott refined index) of 0.79 and 0.99, respectively. Thus, this paper presents an operational tool for providing updated spatio-temporal maps of RS-IWA over large and diverse irrigation surface areas, which is ready to serve as a complementary irrigation water monitoring and management tool.

TI  - Multivariate Assimilation of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture and Evapotranspiration for Drought Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration (ET) are key variables of the terrestrial water cycle with a strong relationship. This study examines remotely sensed soil moisture and evapotranspiration data assimilation (DA) with the aim of improving drought monitoring. Although numerous efforts have gone into assimilating satellite soil moisture observations into land surface models to improve their predictive skills, little attention has been given to the combined use of soil moisture and evapotranspiration to better characterize hydrologic fluxes. In this study, we assimilate two remotely sensed datasets, namely, Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) and MODIS evapotranspiration (MODIS16 ET), at 1-km spatial resolution, into the VIC land surface model by means of an evolutionary particle filter method. To achieve this, a fully parallelized framework based on model and domain decomposition using a parallel divide-and-conquer algorithm was implemented. The findings show improvement in soil moisture predictions by multivariate assimilation of both ET and SM as compared to univariate scenarios. In addition, monthly and weekly drought maps are produced using the updated root-zone soil moisture percentiles over the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint basin in the southeastern United States. The model-based estimates are then compared against the corresponding U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) archive maps. The results are consistent with the USDM maps during the winter and spring season considering the drought extents; however, the drought severity was found to be slightly higher according to DA method. Comparing different assimilation scenarios showed that ET assimilation results in wetter conditions comparing to open-loop and univariate SM DA. The multivariate DA then combines the effects of the two variables and provides an in-between condition.

TI  - Reunion Island, a sentinel territory for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria surveillance in the South-Western Indian Ocean: a retrospective survey using hospitalized patient screening, 2015-2017
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2015, antimicrobial resistance was identified as a public health priority for the South-Western Indian Ocean (SWIO) (i.e. Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte (France), Reunion Island (France), and Seychelles). However, in 2020, colonization rates of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) in human populations on most islands in SWIO were still not known and neither hospital nor community colonization rates had been estimated. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of colonization of six ARB groups in hospitalized patients residing in the SWIO territories. The six groups comprise extended-spectrum betalactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and both ceftazidime and/or imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. (ACB), and ceftazidime and/or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas spp. (PSA)).Methods: Based on comprehensive hospital laboratory ARB screening data, we provide the first estimation of ARB colonization rates in hospitalized patients residing in SWIO (2015-2017). Using ARB colonization rates in Reunion Island (France) as the reference for estimating odds ratio, we identified at risk patients based on their territory of residence.Results: The survey pointed to significantly higher overall ARB colonization rates in patients from Comoros, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Seychelles compared to Reunion Island as the reference. Extended-spectrum betalactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae was found to be the most common ARB group colonizing patients from SWIO territories. The highest MRSA colonization rates were observed in patients from Mayotte and Seychelles. Colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) was highest in patients from Mauritius.Conclusion: These results identify high ARB colonization rates in hospitalized patients from SWIO territories that require further investigation, particularly CRE in Mauritius and MRSA in Seychelles and Mayotte. This study is the first step toward the implementation of a broader regional ARB surveillance system.

TI  - Impedance control of multi-arm space robot for the capture of non-cooperative targets
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Robotic systems are expected to play an increasingly important role in future space activities. The robotic on-orbital service, whose key is the capturing technology, becomes a research hot spot in recent years. This paper studies the dynamics modeling and impedance control of a multi-arm free-flying space robotic system capturing a non-cooperative target. Firstly, a control-oriented dynamics model is essential in control algorithm design and code realization. Unlike a numerical algorithm, an analytical approach is suggested. Using a general and a quasi-coordinate Lagrangian formulation, the kinematics and dynamics equations are derived. Then, an impedance control algorithm is developed which allows coordinated control of the multiple manipulators to capture a target. Through enforcing a reference impedance, end-effectors behave like a mass-damper-spring system fixed in inertial space in reaction to any contact force between the capture hands and the target. Meanwhile, the position and the attitude of the base are maintained stably by using gas jet thrusters to work against the manipulators' reaction. Finally, a simulation by using a space robot with two manipulators and a free-floating non-cooperative target is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Glacier shrinkage and slope processes create habitat at high elevation and microrefugia across treeline for alpine plants during warm stages
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperature rise at the global level and glacier shrinkage are deemed to induce new dynamics between biotic and abiotic factors, especially in mountain regions. In this work, we aimed to assess: (a) the area made available after glacier retreat since the Little Ice Age (LIA) for the colonization of alpine plants; (b) the ability of 14 alpine and nival species, typically growing on peaks and in deglaciated areas, to migrate and survive at lower elevations in microrefugia across the treeline ecotone. In the Adamello-Presanella Massif (Rhaetian Alps), we collected presence data on 14 alpine species within 3 x 3 or 5 x 5 m plots according to slope landforms and deposits. The analysis of the elevation range of the investigated species across the treeline was performed using Sentinel-2 satellite images to derive the actual position of the upper and lower treeline. The differences in the species elevation ranges across slope landforms, in relation to the treeline elevation and aspect, were detected with linear mixed models. Results showed that glaciers contracted sharply by more than 50% between the LIA and 2006, making large deglaciated areas available (more than 57 km2). All the studied species were found at low altitudes across the treeline ecotone, from about 500 to 1200 m below their typical habitat. Six species (Cardamine resedifolia, Cerastium uniflorum, Leucanthemopsis alpina, Luzula alpinopilosa, Oxyria digyna, Saxifraga oppositifolia) significantly exceeded the upper treeline in correspondence of alpine composite channels (p < 0.001 for all species). One species (Adenostyles leucophylla) exceeded the upper treeline in correspondence of composite slope deposits (p < 0.05). Two species (Ranunculus glacialis and S. oppositifolia) reached the lower treeline in composite channels and slope deposits (p = 0.800, and p = 0.519, respectively).The retreat of the alpine glaciers, coupled with the intensification of paraglacial processes, may favor new habitat opportunities at high elevation and microrefugia at low altitudes for nival and alpine species. The widespread presence of microrefugia for alpine plants downslope during warm periods suggests a low incidence of biodiversity loss in the alpine regions due to climate change.

TI  - A Google Earth Engine Tool to Investigate, Map and Monitor Volcanic Thermal Anomalies at Global Scale by Means of Mid-High Spatial Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several satellite-based systems have been developed over the years to study and monitor thermal volcanic activity. Most of them use high temporal resolution satellite data, provided by sensors like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that if on the one hand guarantee a continuous monitoring of active volcanic areas on the other hand are less suited to map thermal anomalies, and to provide accurate information about their features. The Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI), respectively, onboard the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites, providing Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) data at 20 m (MSI) and 30 m (OLI) spatial resolution, may make an important contribution in this area. In this work, we present the first Google Earth Engine (GEE) App to investigate, map and monitor volcanic thermal anomalies at global scale, integrating Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI observations. This open tool, which implements the Normalized Hot spot Indices (NHI) algorithm, enables the analysis of more than 1400 active volcanoes, with very low processing times, thanks to the high GEE computational resources. Performance and limitations of the tool, such as its next upgrades, aiming at increasing the user-friendly experience and extending the temporal range of data analyses, are analyzed and discussed.

TI  - Application of the Method of Orthogonal Projection for Identification of Objects without Specified Shape in Multispectral Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An approach for identification of objects without specified shape using multispectral satellite data is developed. The approach is based on the orthogonalization procedure in extended multidimensional spectral space in which filters that are orthogonal to the hypotheses of desired and similar objects are calculated and, then, scalarly multiplied by the spectra under study. It is shown that normalized rather than original spectra must be used, which leads to a significant decrease in variability of spectra that results in worse recognition of objects and specific calibration must be employed for suppression of atmospheric distortions. It is shown that such a method provides significantly higher recognizability in comparison with the least-squares method that is used in most recognition techniques.

TI  - Application of landsat imageries for mapping post-earthquake landslide, case study: 2012 Ahar-Varzegan earthquake, NW Iran
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2012 Ahar-Varzegan earthquake and its aftershocks have not only caused huge damage with a severe loss of life and property but also induced many geo-hazards with the major type of collapse, creep, slip, debris flow, and fallings that are generally considered as landslide in this study which can cause continuous threats to the affected region. in this study, a semi-automated geo-hazard detection method has been presented to determine the Landslides due to 2012 Ahar-Varzaghan earthquake in area from Ahar to Varzaghan by the use of bi- temporal Landsat images from before and after the earthquake. The accuracy of the results was checked out using field observations, Google Earth images and the error matrix. The results of the visual validation with the Google Earth images showed that the used method can detect landslids with relatively high accuracy.The images of landsat5 and 8 Because of their multispectral advantages can be used as a suitable data source for research on Instabilities. Finally, the validating results obtained by using the error matrix showed the total accuracy of 92.1% and kappa coefficient was 0.99. So based on the results obtained from the above method, the landslides were distributed mainly in slopes between 15 and 40 degrees and the height distribution of instabilities of 1420 to 2000 meters. Also based on vegetation indices, density of landslides have been increased after the earthquake. Generally unstabel slopes are located along river valleys and roads in mountain regions with deep valleys and steep slopes. According to the nature of present study, the obtained result can be useful for environmental planners and project developers.

TI  - An Application of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and GNSS Data for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to delineate post-earthquake landslides within an object-based image analysis (OBIA). We used our resulting landslide inventory map for training the data-driven model of the frequency ratio (FR) for landslide susceptibility modelling and mapping considering eleven conditioning factors of soil type, slope angle, distance to roads, distance to rivers, rainfall, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), aspect, altitude, distance to faults, land cover, and lithology. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) also was used for the susceptibility mapping using expert knowledge. Then, we integrated the data-driven model of the FR with the knowledge-based model of the FAHP to reduce the associated uncertainty in each approach. We validated our resulting landslide inventory map based on 30% of the global positioning system (GPS) points of an extensive field survey in the study area. The remaining 70% of the GPS points were used to validate the performance of the applied models and the resulting landslide susceptibility maps using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our resulting landslide inventory map got a precision of 94% and the AUCs (area under the curve) of the susceptibility maps showed 83%, 89%, and 96% for the F-AHP, FR, and the integrated model, respectively. The introduced methodology in this study can be used in the application of remote sensing data for landslide inventory and susceptibility mapping in other areas where earthquakes are considered as the main landslide-triggered factor.

TI  - Impact of hydro-geological environment on availability of groundwater using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geospatial techniques: A study from the upper Kangsabati river basin
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Kangsabati river basin is situated on the extended part of 'Chhotanagpur Granitic or Granite Gneiss Complex' (CGGC) of West Bengal and Jharkhand. People of this hard rock terrain suffer severely from water scarcity during scorching summer. To delineate groundwater potential zones of the study region, seven hydrogeological factors, such as geology, lineament, slope, drainage, rainfall, soil and land use land cover are considered. The Cartosat-1 DEM of IRS, LISS-3 image of IRS, geological map of GSI, soil map of NBSS&LUP and rainfall data of CWC are arranged and processed in ArcGIS, Erdas Imagine and PCI Geometica softwares as per requirements to prepare seven individual thematic layers. To assign proper weight of an individual factor based on its level of influence in the occurrence of groundwater, the AHP model is adopted to serve the purpose. Finally, the map of the groundwater potential zones is produced by integrating all the seven layers into one in ArcGIS software. The map of groundwater potential zones of the upper Kangsabati river basin shows that an area of 1819.45 km(2) (53.33%) is of good to very good potentiality of groundwater. Only an area of 591.23 km(2) (17.34%) is identified as very poor to poor zones of groundwater prospect. The verification of the study is also done by computing an accuracy assessment. The result of the overall accuracy assessment of the study is recorded to be 79.77%, while the Kappa co-efficient is calculated to be 0.73.

AB  - Our work's primary goal is to reveal the problematic issues related to estimates of the colored organic matter absorption coefficient in the northern seas from data of the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) installed on the Sentinel-3 satellites, e.g., a comparison of the OLCI standard error assessment ADG443_NN_err relating to the measurement and the retrieval of the geophysical products and the uncertainties in the northern seas' real situation. The natural conditions are incredibly unfavorable there, mainly due to frequent cloudiness and low sun heights. We conducted a comprehensive multi-sensor study of the uncertainties using various approaches. We directly compared the data from satellites (OLCI Sentinel-3 and four other ocean color sensors) and field measurements in five sea expeditions (2016-2019) using the different processing algorithms. Our analysis has shown that the final product's real uncertainties are significantly (>= 100%) higher than the calculated errors of the ADG443_NN_err (similar to 10%). The main reason is the unsatisfactory atmospheric correction. We present the analysis of the various influential factors (satellite sensors, processing algorithms, and other parameters) and formulate future work goals.

TI  - Can Medium-Resolution Satellite Imagery Measure Economic Activity at Small Geographies? Evidence from Landsat in Vietnam
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the potential and the limits of medium-resolution satellite data as a proxy for economic activity at small geographic units. Using a commune-level dataset from Vietnam, it compares the performance of commonly used nightlight data and higher resolution Landsat imagery, which measures daytime light reflection. The analysis suggests that Landsat outperforms nighttime lights at predicting enterprise counts, employment, and expenditure in simple regression models. A parsimonious combination of the first two moments of the Landsat spectral bands can explain a reasonable share of the variation in economic activity in the cross-section. There is, however, poor prediction power of either satellite measure for changes over time.

TI  - Online Public Attention During the Early Days of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study Based on Baidu Index
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global public health event, attracting worldwide attention. As a tool to monitor public awareness, internet search engines have been widely used in public health emergencies.Objective: This study aims to use online search data (Baidu Index) to monitor the public's attention and verify internet search engines' function in public attention monitoring of public health emergencies.Methods: We collected the Baidu Index and the case monitoring data from January 20, 2020, to April 20, 2020. We combined the Baidu Index of keywords related to COVID-19 to describe the public attention's temporal trend and spatial distribution, and conducted the time lag cross-correlation analysis.Results: The Baidu Index temporal trend indicated that the changes of the Baidu Index had a clear correspondence with the development time node of the pandemic. The Baidu Index spatial distribution showed that in the regions of central and eastern China, with denser populations, larger internet user bases, and higher economic development levels, the public was more concerned about COVID-19. In addition, the Baidu Index was significantly correlated with six case indicators of new confirmed cases, new death cases, new cured discharge cases, cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative death cases, and cumulative cured discharge cases. Moreover, the Baidu Index was 0-4 days earlier than new confirmed and new death cases, and about 20 days earlier than new cured and discharged cases while 3-5 days later than the change of cumulative cases.Conclusions: The national public's demand for epidemic information is urgent regardless of whether it is located in the hardest hit area. The public was more sensitive to the daily new case data that represents the progress of the epidemic, but the public's attention to the epidemic situation in other areas may lag behind. We could set the Baidu Index as the sentinel and the database in the online infoveillance system for infectious disease and public health emergencies. According to the monitoring data, the government needs to prevent and control the possible outbreak in advance and communicate the risks to the public so as to ensure the physical and psychological health of the public in the epidemic.

TI  - LEO Onboard Real-Time Orbit Determination Using GPS/BDS Data with an Optimal Stochastic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advancements of Earth observations, remote sensing, communications and navigation augmentation based on low Earth orbit (LEO) platforms present strong requirements for accurate, real-time and autonomous navigation of LEO satellites. Precise onboard real-time orbit determination (RTOD) using the space-borne data of multiple global navigation satellite systems (multi-GNSS) becomes practicable along with the availability of multi-GNSS. We study the onboard RTOD algorithm and experiments by using America's Global Positioning System (GPS) and China's regional BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS-2) space-borne data of the FengYun-3C satellite. A new pseudo-ambiguity parameter, which combines the constant phase ambiguity, the orbit and clock offset error of the GPS/BDS broadcast ephemeris in the line-of-sight (LOS), is defined and estimated in order to reduce the negative effect of the LOS error on onboard RTOD. The analyses on the variation of the LOS error in the GPS/BDS broadcast ephemeris indicate that the pseudo-ambiguity parameter could be modeled as a random walk, and the setting of the power spectral density in the random walk model decides whether the pseudo-ambiguity can be estimated reasonably and the LOS error could be reduced or not. For different types of GPS/BDS satellites, the LOS errors show different variation characteristics, so the power spectral density should be set separately and differently. A numerical search approach is presented in this paper to find the optimal setting of the power spectral density for each type of GPS/BDS satellite by a series of tests. Based on the optimal stochastic model, a 3-dimensional (3D) real-time orbit accuracy of 0.7-2.0 m for position and 0.7-1.7 mm/s for velocity could be achieved only with dual-frequency BDS measurements and the broadcast ephemeris, while a notably superior orbit accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m for position and 0.3-0.5 mm/s for velocity is achievable using dual-frequency GPS/BDS measurements, due to the absorption effect of the estimated pseudo-ambiguity on the LOS error of the GPS/BDS broadcast ephemeris. Compared to using GPS-alone data, the GPS/BDS fusion only marginally improves the onboard RTOD orbit accuracy by about 1-3 cm, but the inclusion of BDS satellites increases the number of the tracked GNSS satellites and thus speeds up the convergence of the filter. Furthermore, the GPS/BDS fusion could help suppress the local orbit errors, ensure the orbit accuracy and improve the reliability and availability of the onboard RTOD when fewer GPS satellites are tracked in some anomalous arcs.

TI  - Systematic analysis of the scientific literature on population surveillance
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Population surveillance provides data on the health status of the population through continuous scrutiny of different indicators. Identifying risk factors is essential for the quickly detecting and controlling of epidemic outbreaks and reducing the incidence of cross-infections and non-communicable diseases. The objective of the present study is to analyze research on population surveillance, identifying the main topics of interest for investigators in the area.Methodology: We included documents indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection in the period from 2000 to 2019 and assigned with the generic Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) "population surveillance" or its related terms ("public health surveillance," "sentinel surveillance" or "biosurveillance"). A co-occurrence analysis was undertaken to identify the document clusters comprising the main research topics. Scientific production, collaboration, and citation patterns in each of the clusters were characterized bibliometrically. We also analyzed research on coronaviruses, relating the results obtained to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.Results: We included 39,184 documents, which reflected a steady growth in scientific output driven by papers on "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health" (21.62% of the documents) and "Infectious Diseases" (10.49%). Research activity was concentrated in North America (36.41%) and Europe (32.09%). The USA led research in the area (40.14% of documents). Ten topic clusters were identified, including "Disease Outbreaks," which is closely related to two other clusters ("Genetics" and "Influenza"). Other clusters of note were "Cross Infections" as well as one that brought together general public health concepts and topics related to non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular and coronary diseases, mental diseases, diabetes, wound and injuries, stroke, and asthma). The rest of the clusters addressed "Neoplasms," "HIV," "Pregnancy," "Substance Abuse/Obesity," and "Tuberculosis." Although research on coronavirus has focused on population surveillance only occasionally, some papers have analyzed and collated guidelines whose relevance to the dissemination and management of the COVID-19 pandemic has become obvious. Topics include tracing the spread of the virus, limiting mass gatherings that would facilitate its propagation, and the imposition of quarantines. There were important differences in the scientific production and citation of different clusters: the documents on mental illnesses, stroke, substance abuse/obesity, and cross-infections had much higher citations than the clusters on disease outbreaks, tuberculosis, and especially coronavirus, where these values are substantially lower.Conclusions: The role of population surveillance should be strengthened, promoting research and the development of public health surveillance systems in countries whose contribution to the area is limited.

TI  - Three Types of Nodal Melanocytic Nevi in Sentinel Lymph Nodes of Patients With Melanoma: Pitfalls, Immunohistochemistry, and a Review of the Literature
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence or absence of metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes often drives melanoma staging, prognosis, and treatment. However, distinguishing between metastatic melanoma cells and clusters of benign melanocytic nevus cells is not always straightforward. When morphologic hematoxylin and eosin interpretation alone is not sufficient, additional hematoxylin and eosin sections and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies may be beneficial. This review and small cases series of 3 diagnostically challenging melanocytic sentinel lymph node cases highlights the IHC approach to evaluate intraparenchymal nodal melanocytic nevi, coexistent metastatic melanoma with adjacent melanocytic nevi cells, and nodal blue nevi. In challenging cases, cytological morphology of the melanocytes, location within the lymph node, and IHC studies may assist in diagnosis. If these tools yield conflicting results, expert opinion is recommended.

TI  - Land subsidence in Isfahan metropolitan and its relationship with geological and geomorphological settings revealed by Sentinel-1A InSAR observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent reports from Isfahan, Iran, have proclaimed cases of land subsidence arising from persistence of drought events and groundwater overexploitation. In this light, the present study attempts to conduct an PS-InSAR analysis of subsidence events using the Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery technique, in order to develop a subsidence map of the target study region, covering the period from October 16, 2014 to November 22, 2019 as well as to investigate its relation to geological/geomorphological factors. Toward this end, the methodology proceeds to detect land subsidence phenomenon across the Isfahan Metropolitan area, situated on the Zayande-Rud River Terrace (ZRT) and Isfahan Alluvium Plain (IAP). A total of 198 Sentinel images were used to derive deformation specifics observed throughout ZRT & IAP by dint of incorporating ascending and descending passes of the InSAR technique. As maintained by spatial and temporal variation maps of surface deformations in the urban regions of Isfahan, ZRT & IAP have undergone various orders of subsidence throughout the observation period, at an estimated rate of - 5 to -100 mm/year. Overall, land subsidence appears to increase from south towards the northern, northeastern, and eastern sectors of Isfahan Metropolitan, while the southern sectors are nearly a stable area. This study indicates that the spatial subsidence pattern during the study period corresponds closely to the spatial distribution of ZRT & IAP in the Isfahan Metropolitan area.

TI  - Modeling and Mapping of Soil Salinity and its Impact on Paddy Lands in Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a major threat to land productivity, water resources and agriculture in coastal areas and arid and semi-arid regions of the world. This has a significantly negative effect on the land and causes desertification. Monitoring salt accumulation in the soil is crucial for the prevention of land degradation in such environments. This study attempted to estimate and map soil salinity in Jaffna Peninsula, a semi-arid region of Sri Lanka. A Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model was constructed using Sentinel 2A satellite imagery and field-measured soil electrical conductivity (EC) values. The results showed that satisfactory prediction of the soil salinity could be made based on the PLSR model coupled with Sentinel 2A satellite imagery (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.4830). Overall, 32.8% of the land and 45% of paddy lands in Jaffna Peninsula are affected by salt. The findings of this study indicate that PLSR is suitable for the soil salinity mapping, especially in semi-arid regions like Jaffna Peninsula. The results underpin the importance of building adaptive capacity and implementing suitable preventive strategies for sustainable land and agricultural management.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the primary treatment of apparent uterine-confined endometrial carcinoma, pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy has been considered the standard of care. Although some retrospective data suggest that the sentinel lymph node algorithm without complete lymphadenectomy can be used without jeopardizing oncologic outcome, prospective data are lacking.Primary Objectives To assess the 36 month incidence of pelvic/non-vaginal recurrence in women with pathologically confirmed stage I intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who have bilateral negative pelvic sentinel lymph nodes.Study Hypothesis We hypothesize that patients with stage I, intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who have bilateral negative pelvic sentinel lymph nodes will demonstrate a pelvic/non-vaginal recurrence rate comparable to historical estimate of stage I, intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma patients (estimated 2.5%).Trial Design This prospective multicenter single-arm observational study will follow women with stage I, intermediate risk endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma who have undergone successful hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsies, for recurrence. All patients will undergo lymphatic mapping using indocynanine green and will either receive no adjuvant treatment or vaginal brachytherapy only. Patients will be followed for 36 months.Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Patients will be enrolled in the study cohort if all the following criteria are met: (i) at time of surgery: hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy, and successful bilateral pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping; (ii) on final pathology: pathologic stage I, intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (grade 1 or grade 2 with >= 50% myometrial invasion, or grade 3 with <50% myometrial invasion), negative pelvic peritoneal cytology, and bilateral sentinel lymph nodes negative for malignancy; (iii) recommended adjuvant treatment: vaginal brachytherapy or no adjuvant treatment.Primary Endpoint Incidence of pelvic/non-vaginal recurrence at 36 months.Sample Size 182 patients for study cohortEstimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results Accrual will be completed in 2023 with results reported in 2026.

TI  - Theoretical and Conceptual Aspects of Forming the Methodical System of Physical Education of the Students of Agrarian Higher Educational Institutions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers the theoretical and conceptual aspects of forming the methodical system of the students' physical education. Modern society requires the theory and practice of higher education institutions to direct the accumulated scientific experience at the basis of the formation of a new structure of competent professionals who can think creatively, navigate in the information space, master worldview paradigms on their own and systematically maintain their health and high mental and physical capacity. As a result, the need for effective preparation of students for independent creative and research activities and the ability to maintain their physical condition has significantly increased. It developed in a need to update the educational process in higher education institutions owing to its focus on the model of the future professional activity of graduates under conditions of introducing effective technologies for organizing the educational process, which will promote the formation of personality with creative thinking and a healthful mind. The aim of the study is to substantiate the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the methodical system of physical education of the students of higher educational agricultural institutions, to introduce it into the educational process, and verify its efficiency. The methodical system of physical education of the students of higher educational agrarian institutions is included in the uniform system of pedagogical education and represents an integral formation which allows providing school and university students with special knowledge, vital motor abilities and skills, harmonious development of the forms and functions of an organism, good health, volitional, spiritual, and aesthetic qualities of the individual. Updating the methodical system of physical education of the students of agricultural educational institutions is essential to ensure the transition from traditional to the innovative educational process, aimed at developing practical skills and values of their own health and the health of others. The study was conducted at the Polissia National University in 2013-2019, and 369 students, including 195 males and 174 females took part in it. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the methodical system was carried out on the basis of the testing results of the students' level of theoretical knowledge, motivation, and the amount of motor activity. Checking the effectiveness of the developed methodical system showed its greater efficiency in comparison to the traditional program of physical education at higher education institutions. The students (both males and females) of the experimental groups were recorded to have significantly (p<0.001) better indicators than the CG students, according to the following criteria: the level of theoretical knowledge about the role and importance of physical education in strengthening health, longevity, improving the working capacity, ensuring the efficiency of the future professional activities; the students' motivation to regular exercises and sports; the amount of physical activity of students while studying at university (physical education classes, independent classes, sports sections, morning exercises, etc.). The practical aspect of the study is determined by a comprehensive solution to the problem of introducing the methodical system of physical education, which ensures the achievement of the projected results in the discipline of Physical Education into the educational process of agricultural higher education institutions.

TI  - Geochemistry of surface soil in the Eastern Pamirs and its implications for Muztagata ice core dust provenance
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the geochemical composition of mineral dust is highly effective for provenance tracing. Studies on the geochemistry of surface soils in the Pamirs, especially with different size fractions, are relatively limited. This study investigated the major, trace and rare earth elements (REEs) of surface soil samples collected on the Eastern Pamirs. The Fe/Al (similar to 0.60), Mg/Al (similar to 0.30) and Ti/Al (similar to 0.05) ratios clearly highlight its clayey nature, while the La/Th (similar to 2.60) and Th/U (similar to 4.00) ratios indicate it is typical of the upper continental crust (UCC). The La-Th-Sc and Zr/10-Th-Sc ternary diagrams show the source rock of the Eastern Pamirs surface soil to be mainly felsic. The bulk and <20 mu m fractions were separated and analysed, showing similar REE patterns. However, the La-N/Sm-N, delta Ce, Ce/Nd, Th/Tb and Y/Er ratios of the <20 mu m fraction differ from those of the bulk, suggesting particle size sorting has a significant impact on the elemental composition of surface soil samples. The Taklimakan Desert sand samples partly display similar tracing indices while the Eastern Pamirs surface soil samples generally show different provenance indexes compared to the Muztagata ice core and aerosol dust, indicating that the Taklimakan Desert might be an important contributor to the Muztagata ice core/aerosol dust and the local contribution is minor. Analysis of the MODIS AOD fields, wind streamline fields and HYSPLIT backward trajectory model demonstrates certain atmospheric circulation patterns and dust transport pathways in the Eastern Pamirs, which allows for sourcing of Muztagata dust from the Taklimakan Desert, Central Asian deserts, and northern Afghanistan and Pakistan.

AB  - Many freely available global or quasi-global digital elevation model (DEM) datasets, including Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3 Dimensions (3D) 30 m DEM (AW3D30 DEM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer DEM (ASTER DEM), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM (SRTM DEM), Multiple-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain DEM (MERIT DEM), and TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) DEM (TanDEM-X DEM), are extremely useful products for many applications, so it is necessary to make a reasonable analysis of the quality of these DEMs. The quality of these DEMs is affected by both horizontal and vertical errors. However, most related researches have paid little attention to the effects of horizontal errors on the vertical accuracy of DEMs. Herein, after analysing the horizontal errors caused in the data acquisition process from optical stereo pairs and interferometry, experiments were proposed to assess the horizontal errors in DEMs. Then, we used the high accuracy digital surface model (DSM) of the Changsha area generated from the ZiYuan-3 triplet stereos to investigate the impact of horizontal errors on the accuracy of the five freely available DEMs. The subpixel level horizontal errors of the five DEMs were calculated, showing that the TanDEM-X DEM has systematic offsets and the other four DEMs have strip-like geometric errors. All the DEMs, except ASTER DEM, attained an accuracy increase of approximately 10% after the horizontal errors were removed. In mountainous areas, correcting the horizontal errors could eliminate the elevation errors caused by the imaging geometry of the optical camera and radar system. Generally, AW3D30 DEM has the best performance in terms of overall elevation accuracy and geometric accuracy after eliminating horizontal errors, and so it can have wide-ranging applications. These findings demonstrate the importance of removing horizontal errors to improve the elevation accuracy in practical applications using these global freely available DEMs.

T2  - REVISTA INCLUSIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the worldview concept of a Posthuman as a subject of global information society. Digitalization has influenced all institutions and scopes of human activities, having varied the type of interrelations between them, the phenomenon of human has been varied, now we speak about the phenomenon of the posthuman (nearly human, or human in principle). In the transhumanist theory of evolution (revolution) of humanity, the next stage of development is the Posthuman, who is as different from human as a human from a monkey. Logical cognitive and social problems under the conditions of wide-scale computer informatization of society should be considered in the context of organic interconnection with human capital assets and humanistic ethics.

TI  - Humans and Elephants, Transforming and Transformed: Two Naro Myths about Ontological Mutability
T2  - FOLKLORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Two myth texts were collected by the author from the Naro storyteller Qhomatca in May 1995, on the motifs of ontological transformation and the equivalence of women and game. The animal featured in the two stories is the elephant, a species especially close in San myth and belief to humans, especially women. Transformation and woman-game conflation are both pan-San mythemes and premier manifestations of the cosmological theme of ontological mutability that pervades San thought and experience. The analysis of the texts is couched in terms of this theme, presented in relational terms of human-animal intersubjectivity. The article presents an ontological schema and a way of perceiving the human-animal relationship that is suppressed in the Western worldview.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of Lyme disease risk in Canada, 2019: Results from the first year of the Canadian Lyme Sentinel Network (CaLSeN).
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is an emerging vector-borne zoonotic disease of increasing public health importance in Canada. As part of its mandate, the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network (CLyDRN) launched a pan-Canadian sentinel surveillance initiative, the Canadian Lyme Sentinel Network (CaLSeN), in 2019.OBJECTIVES: To create a standardized, national sentinel surveillance network providing a real-time portrait of the evolving environmental risk of Lyme disease in each province.METHODS: A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used in the selection of sentinel regions. Within each sentinel region, a systematic drag sampling protocol was performed in selected sampling sites. Ticks collected during these active surveillance visits were identified to species, and Ixodes spp. ticks were tested for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti and Powassan virus.RESULTS: In 2019, a total of 567 Ixodes spp. ticks (I. scapularis [n=550]; I. pacificus [n=10]; and I. angustus [n=7]) were collected in seven provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The highest mean tick densities (nymphs/100 m2) were found in sentinel regions of Lunenburg (0.45), Montreal (0.43) and Granby (0.38). Overall, the Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence in ticks was 25.2% (0%-45.0%). One I. angustus nymph from British Columbia was positive for Babesia microti, a first for the province. The deer tick lineage of Powassan virus was detected in one adult I. scapularis in Nova Scotia.CONCLUSION: CaLSeN provides the first coordinated national active surveillance initiative for tick-borne disease in Canada. Through multidisciplinary collaborations between experts in each province, the pilot year was successful in establishing a baseline for Lyme disease risk across the country, allowing future trends to be detected and studied.

TI  - FSDAF 2.0: Improving the performance of retrieving land cover changes and preserving spatial details
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is a feasible solution to resolve the tradeoff between the temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images. However, the development of spatiotemporal fusion algorithms has not yet reached maturity, and existing methods still face many challenges, e.g., accurately retrieving land cover changes and improving the robustness of fusion algorithms. The Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method proposed by Zhu a al. in 2016 solved the abovementioned problems to some extent. However, FSDAF has two shortcomings that can be further improved: (1) FSDAF is prone to losing spatial details and predicting a "blurrier" image due to the input of coarse pixels containing type change information and a large amount of boundary information for unmixing calculation, and (2) FSDAF does not optimize the areas of land cover change. In this paper, an improved FSDAF method incorporating change detection technology and an optimized model for changed-type areas (FSDAF 2.0) was proposed to improve the aforementioned problems. Based on the existing FSDAF algorithm, FSDAF 2.0 excludes changed pixels and boundary pixels for unmixing calculation, and establishes a model to optimize the changed pixels. Its performance was compared with that of the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the original FSDAF, and the enhanced FSDAF that incorporates sub-pixel class fraction change information (SFSDAF). Two sites consisting of landscapes with heterogeneous and large-scale abrupt land cover changes were employed for testing. The results of the experiments demonstrate that FSDAF 2.0 effectively improves the shortcomings of FSDAF, blends synthetic fine-resolution images with higher accuracy than that of the other three methods at two different sites, and strengthens the robustness of the fusion algorithm. More importantly, FSDAF 2.0 has a powerful ability to retrieve land cover changes and provides a feasible way to improve the performance of retrieving land cover changes. Consequently, FSDAF 2.0 has great potential for monitoring complex dynamic changes in the Earth's surface.

TI  - A multilevel statistical technique to identify the dominant landscape metrics of greenspace for determining land surface temperature
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although considerable effort has been made to investigate the complex deriving forces of land surface temperature (LST), relatively little attention has been paid to the issue of spatial hierarchy, which is an intrinsic property of the urban system. To solve this problem, we propose a multilevel statistical technique, incorporating a regression tree and an improved hierarchical partitioning model, to investigate the hierarchical effects of greenspace spatial patterns on LST. We tested the technique in Guangzhou with two Landsat 5 images acquired in summer. The results show that the proposed technique explicitly identifies the nested hierarchical structure of LST. Greenspace spatial composition is the dominant metric at the highest level, whereas some spatial configuration metrics affect LST variations more in the lower levels. One obvious advantage of the technique is its ability to identify the dominant landscape metrics of greenspace and to determine the hierarchical effects of LST formation. The technique serves as an important approach for environmental studies of urban heat, and it furthers our understanding of the complex and hierarchical mechanism of LST patterns and processes in urban areas. The idea of this multilevel statistical technique is also applicable to the study of other mechanisms in urban systems.

TI  - Deep learning radiomics of ultrasonography: Identifying the risk of axillary non-sentinel lymph node involvement in primary breast cancer
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Completion axillary lymph node dissection is overtreatment for patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in whom the metastatic risk of residual non-SLN (NSLN) is low. However, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network panel posits that none of the previous studies has successfully identified such subset patients. Here, we develop a multicentre deep learning radiomics of ultrasonography model (DLRU) to predict the risk of SLN and NSLN metastasis.Methods: In total, 937 eligible breast cancer patients with ultrasound images were enrolled from two hospitals as the training set (n = 542) and independent test set (n = 395) respectively. Using the images, we developed and validated a prediction model combined with deep learning radiomics and axillary ultrasound to sequentially identify the metastatic risk of SLN and NSLN, thereby, classifying patients to relevant axillary management groups.Findings: In the test set, the DLRU yields the best performance in identifying patients with metastatic disease in SLNs (sensitivity=98.4%, 95% CI 96.6-100) and NSLNs (sensitivity=98.4%, 95% CI 95.6-99.9). The DLRU also accurately stratifies patients without metastasis in SLN or NSLN into the corresponding low-risk (LR)-SLN and high-risk (HR)-SLN&LR-NSLN category with the negative predictive value of 97% (95% CI 94.2-100) and 91.7% (95% CI 88.8-97.9), respectively. Moreover, compared with the current clinical management, DLRU appropriately assigned 51% (39.6%/77.4%) of overtreated patients in the entire study cohort into the LR group, perhaps avoiding overtreatment.Interpretation: The performance of the DLRU indicates that it may offer a simple preoperative tool to promote personalized axillary management of breast cancer.Funding: The National Nature Science Foundation of China; The National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China; The Scientific research project of Heilongjiang Health Committee; The Postgraduate Research &Practice Innovation Program of Harbin Medical University.

TI  - An End-to-End Deep Fusion Model for Mapping Forests at Tree Species Levels with High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the distribution of forest resources at tree species levels is important due to their strong association with many quantitative and qualitative indicators. With the ongoing development of artificial intelligence technologies, the effectiveness of deep-learning classification models for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images has been proved. However, due to the poor statistical separability and complex scenarios, it is still challenging to realize fully automated and highly accurate forest types at tree species level mapping. To solve the problem, a novel end-to-end deep learning fusion method for HSR remote sensing images was developed by combining the advantageous properties of multi-modality representations and the powerful features of post-processing step to optimize the forest classification performance refined to the dominant tree species level in an automated way. The structure of the proposed model consisted of a two-branch fully convolutional network (dual-FCN8s) and a conditional random field as recurrent neural network (CRFasRNN), which named dual-FCN8s-CRFasRNN in the paper. By constructing a dual-FCN8s network, the dual-FCN8s-CRFasRNN extracted and fused multi-modality features to recover a high-resolution and strong semantic feature representation. By imbedding the CRFasRNN module into the network as post-processing step, the dual-FCN8s-CRFasRNN optimized the classification result in an automatic manner and generated the result with explicit category information. Quantitative evaluations on China's Gaofen-2 (GF-2) HSR satellite data showed that the dual-FCN8s-CRFasRNN provided a competitive performance with an overall classification accuracy (OA) of 90.10%, a Kappa coefficient of 0.8872 in the Wangyedian forest farm, and an OA of 74.39%, a Kappa coefficient of 0.6973 in the GaoFeng forest farm, respectively. Experiment results also showed that the proposed model got higher OA and Kappa coefficient metrics than other four recently developed deep learning methods and achieved a better trade-off between automaticity and accuracy, which further confirmed the applicability and superiority of the dual-FCN8s-CRFasRNN in forest types at tree species level mapping tasks.

TI  - An investigation of potential pyroclastic deposits on the southeast limb of the Moon
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the physical and spectral properties of potential dark mantling deposits (PDMDs) previously and newly identified on the SE limb of the Moon, near the craters Humboldt and Petavius. The goals of this investigation were to constrain the composition and mode of emplacement of these poorly studied deposits, to identify interdeposit variations, and to use these results to draw conclusions about regional and subsurface geologic processes. Our investigation involved an assessment of both the physical properties (size, texture, morphology) and spectral properties (albedo, absorption bands, color ratios) utilizing remote sensing data from multiple lunar orbital missions. We found that many of the SE Limb deposits previously identified as possibly pyroclastic in origin were likely effusively emplaced. However, we also identified several likely pyroclastic deposits, including three not previously mapped. We found that the volcanic deposits across the study area comprise three major spectral groups: one similar to Mare Fecunditatis, one similar to Mare Australe, and one similar to known glassy pyroclastic deposits elsewhere on the Moon. We conclude that volcanism across the SE limb was likely fed from at least two distinct magma source regions, and that the type and extent of surface expression of this volcanic activity was possibly influenced by regional variations in crustal thickness. Our documentation and analysis of the complex volcanic history in this region of the Moon supports ongoing efforts to develop increasingly detailed interpretations of the volcanic history of the entire Moon.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer-an updated overview
T2  - EUROPEAN SURGERY-ACTA CHIRURGICA AUSTRIACA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Sentinel lymphadenectomy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection as a staging tool in early breast cancer. To be accepted as a standard of care, it had to pass successfully through a long journey which started in the early 1990s. Methods We carried out a comprehensive literature review focusing on the journey of the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer from its start until its current station, including the variable clinical applications, the current debates, and the future issues. Results Adoption of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a standard axillary staging procedure was a marvelous trend that helped to decrease the complications of axillary dissection and significantly improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer. Various mapping techniques can be used for SLN localization, rendering oncology centers that have variable capabilities and preparations able to perform the procedure. This applies to specimen processing techniques as well. Many debates faced the researchers throughout the SLNB journey. They are all explained in the current article, in addition to the ongoing trials and the future aspects of SLNB in breast cancer. Conclusion Further research should be conducted to help resolve the clinical issues which are still debatable and to provide bases for improving the future trends which are progressing towards limiting the role of axillary dissection and axillary surgery to the minimum required level.

TI  - Novel approach of upscaling the FAO AquaCrop model into regional scale by using distributed crop parameters derived from remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed crop models were considered a useful tool for allocating rational water resources. However, how to upscale the crop model into the regional scale is a key issue because the associated crop parameters tend to have spatial heterogeneity according to their feedback to the environment. The remote sensing may provide a possible method for generating the spatial distribution of crop parameters, thereby improving the upscaling approach. On this basis, this study aims to achieve the spatial distribution of crop parameters and establish the distributed AquaCrop-RS model by means of remote sensing. The results showed that the distribution of two crop parameters, namely, the maximum canopy coverage CCx* and the relative biomass B-rel* was significantly heterogeneous with the spatial variability coefficient of 8% and 8.5% for CCx* in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and that of 6.3% and 4.6% for B-rel*. Compared with the AquaCrop-GIS model without introducing the spatial parameters, the simulation accuracy of AquaCrop-RS model was improved by 20% in regional crop water consumption and by 26-36% in regional yield. The new upscaling approach could be an effective and promising method of crop model upscaling.

TI  - Development of Fog Detection Algorithm Using GK2A/AMI and Ground Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog affects transportation due to low visibility and also aggravates air pollutants. Thus, accurate detection and forecasting of fog are important for the safety of transportation. In this study, we developed a decision tree type fog detection algorithm (hereinafter GK2A_FDA) using the GK2A/AMI and auxiliary data. Because of the responses of the various channels depending on the time of day and the underlying surface characteristics, several versions of the algorithm were created to account for these differences according to the solar zenith angle (day/dawn/night) and location (land/sea/coast). Numerical model data were used to distinguish the fog from low clouds. To test the detection skill of GK2A_FDA, we selected 23 fog cases that occurred in South Korea and used them to determine the threshold values (12 cases) and validate GK2A_FDA (11 cases). Fog detection results were validated using the visibility data from 280 stations in South Korea. For quantitative validation, statistical indices, such as the probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), bias ratio (Bias), and equitable threat score (ETS), were used. The total average POD, FAR, Bias, and ETS for training cases (validation cases) were 0.80 (0.82), 0.37 (0.29), 1.28 (1.16), and 0.52 (0.59), respectively. In general, validation results showed that GK2A_FDA effectively detected the fog irrespective of time and geographic location, in terms of accuracy and stability. However, its detection skill and stability were slightly dependent on geographic location and time. In general, the detection skill and stability of GK2A_FDA were found to be better on land than on coast at all times, and at night than day at any location.

TI  - In Vivo Lymphatic Circulating Tumor Cells and Progression of Metastatic Disease
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryDeadly metastases occur when tumor cells are shed from primary tumor into lymph and blood that circulate in distinct networks of vessels and disseminate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) through the body. Therefore, detection of CTCs at potentially treatable early disease stage might improve patient survival. However, most efforts have been made to test CTCs in blood only. Here, we explored the clinically relevant photoacoustic and fluorescent flow cytometry for early in vivo detection of lymphatic CTCs using metastatic melanoma and breast cancer mouse models. We demonstrated the presence of detectable lymphatic CTCs at pre-metastatic disease, estimated correlation between CTCs, primary tumor, and metastasis, and observed parallel CTC dissemination by blood and lymph. Our findings suggest the use of lymphatic CTC testing in vivo as a new indicator of metastasis initiation, and combined assessment of two body fluids as a more promising diagnostic platform compared to existing mono-detection of blood CTCs.The dissemination of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by lymph fluid is one of the key events in the development of tumor metastasis. However, little progress has been made in studying lymphatic CTCs (L-CTCs). Here, we demonstrate the detection of L-CTCs in preclinical mouse models of melanoma and breast cancer using in vivo high-sensitivity photoacoustic and fluorescent flow cytometry. We discovered that L-CTCs are be detected in pre-metastatic disease stage. The smallest primary tumor that shed L-CTCs was measured as 0.094mmx0.094mm, its volume was calculated as 0.0004 mm(3); and its productivity was estimated as 1 L-CTC per 30 minutes. As the disease progressed, primary tumors continued releasing L-CTCs with certain individual dynamics. The integrated assessment of lymph and blood underlined the parallel dissemination of CTCs at all disease stages. However, the analysis of links between L-CTC counts, blood CTC (B-CTC) counts, primary tumor size and metastasis did not reveal statistically significant correlations, likely due to L-CTC heterogeneity. Altogether, our results showed the feasibility of our diagnostic platform using photoacoustic flow cytometry for preclinical L-CTC research with translational potential. Our findings also demonstrated new insights into lymphatic system involvement in CTC dissemination. They help to lay the scientific foundation for the consideration of L-CTCs as prognostic markers of metastasis and to emphasize the integrative assessment of lymph and blood.

TI  - Urbanization and Increasing Flood Risk in the Northern Coast of Central Java-Indonesia: An Assessment towards Better Land Use Policy and Flood Management
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores urbanization and flood events in the northern coast of Central Java with river basin as its unit of analysis. Two types of analysis were applied (i.e., spatial data and non-spatial data analysis) at four river basin areas in Central Java-Indonesia. The spatial analysis is focused on the assessment of LULC change in 2009-2018 based on Landsat Imagery. The non-spatial data (i.e., rural-urban classification and flood events) were overlaid with results of spatial data analyses. Our findings show that urbanization, as indicated by the growth rate of built-up areas, is very significant. Notable exposure to flood has taken place in the urban and potentially urban areas. The emerging discussion indicates that river basins possess dual spatial identity in the urban system (policy- and land-use-related). Proper land use planning and control is an essential instrument to safeguard urban areas (such as the case study area) and the entire island of Java in Indonesia. More attention should be put upon the river basin areas in designing eco-based approach to tackle the urban flood crises. In this case, the role of governance in flood management is crucial.

TI  - Mapping Flood-Based Farming Systems with Bayesian Networks
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Many actors in agricultural research, development, and policy arenas require accurate information on the spatial extents of cropping and farming practices. While remote sensing provides ways for obtaining such information, it is often difficult to distinguish between different types of agricultural practices or identify particular farming systems. Stochastic system behavior or similarity in the spectral signatures of different system components can lead to misclassification. We addressed this challenge by using a probabilistic reasoning engine informed by expert knowledge and remote sensing data to map flood-based farming systems (FBFS) across Kisumu County in Kenya and the Tigray region in Ethiopia. Flood-based farming is an important form of agricultural production employed in regions with seasonal water surplus, which can be harvested and used to irrigate crops. Geographic settings for FBFS vary widely in terms of hydrology, vegetation, and local practices of agronomic flooding. Agronomic success is often difficult to anticipate, because the timing and amount of flooding usually cannot be precisely predicted. We generated a Bayesian network model to describe the FBFS settings of the study regions. We acquired three years (2014-2016) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra spectral data as eight-day composite time series and elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) to compute 10 spatial data metrics corresponding to 10 of the 17 Bayesian network nodes. We used the spatial data metrics in a fully probabilistic framework to generate the 10 spatial data nodes. We then used these as inputs for the probabilistic model to generate prior and posterior spatial estimates for specific metrics along with their spatially explicit uncertainties. We show how such an approach can be used to predict plausible areas for FBFS based on several scenarios. We demonstrate how spatially explicit information can be derived from remote sensing data as fuzzy quantifiers for incorporating uncertainties when mapping complex systems. The approach achieved a remarkably accurate result in both study areas, where 84-90% of various FBFS fields sampled were correctly mapped as having a high chance of being suitable for the practice.

TI  - Keeping up with the times: Mapping range-wide habitat suitability for endangered species in a changing environment
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biologists and policy-makers have the difficult task of allocating limited resources to habitat conservation and management for endangered species in the face of changing environmental conditions. Satellite remote sensing can inform conservation because it is an efficient means to obtain environmental data over broad spatial and temporal extents. Yet, the challenges of accessing, processing, and analyzing remote sensing data hinder wider application of these techniques in conservation planning. We used Landsat data and hierarchical statistical models to link satellite-derived habitat measurements with abundance of endangered Yuma Ridgway's rails (Rallus obsoletus yumanensis) within the Lower Colorado River Basin and Salton Sink, USA. We addressed many of the challenges facing the application of remote sensing techniques by using the web-based, freely-available Google Earth Engine to process Landsat datasets, apply habitat models, and generate maps to predict habitat suitability at a fine spatial grain (30 m) across the range of the species. These maps are shareable, interactive, and easy to update annually as habitat conditions change using a Google Earth Engine App we developed. Thus, we provide a framework for building habitat suitability models and maps to help target adaptive habitat management over broad extents for sensitive species, enabling biologists to improve conservation and restoration efforts regularly as conditions change in highly variable ecosystems. We demonstrate this approach for Yuma Ridgway's rails, but our methods for merging hierarchical statistical models with open-source mapping software to describe spatial-temporal heterogeneity in habitat quality are applicable to any species, and are especially helpful to species inhabiting highly variable ecosystems.

TI  - Epidemiological Investigation of a Rift Valley Fever Outbreak in Humans and Livestock in Kenya, 2018
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - On the last week of May of 2018, a community-based syndromic surveillance system detected mass abortions and deaths of young livestock in northeastern Kenya. Two weeks later, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was confirmed in humans presenting with febrile illness and hemorrhagic syndrome in the same region. A joint animal and human response team carried out an investigation to characterize the outbreak and identify drivers of disease transmission. Here, we describe the outbreak investigation and findings. A total of 106 human cases were identified in the months of May and June 2018: 92% (98) and 8% (8) of these cases occurring in the northern and western regions of Kenya, respectively. Seventy-six (72%) were probable cases, and 30 (28%) were laboratory confirmed by ELISA and/or PCR. Among the confirmed cases, the median age was 27.5 years (interquartile range = 20), and 60% (18) were males. Overall, the case fatality rate was7%(n = 8). The majority of the confirmed cases, 19 (63%), reported contact with livestock during slaughter and consumption of meat from sick animals. All confirmed cases had fever, 40% (12) presented with hemorrhagic syndrome, and 23% (7) presented with jaundice. Forty-three livestock herds with at least one suspect and/or confirmed animal case were identified. Death of young animals was reported in 93%(40) and abortions in 84%(36) of livestock herds. The outbreak is indicative of the emergence potential of RVF in traditionally high- and low-risk areas and the risk posed by zoonosis to livestock keepers.

TI  - A Quantitative Framework for Analyzing Spatial Dynamics of Flood Events: A Case Study of Super Cyclone Amphan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the flooding risk hotspot is crucial for aiding a rapid response and prioritizes mitigation efforts over large disaster impacted regions. While climate change is increasing the risk of floods in many vulnerable regions of the world, the commonly used crisis map is inefficient and cannot rapidly determine the spatial variation and intensity of flooding extension across the affected areas. In such cases, the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistic can detect heterogeneity or the flooding hotspot at a local spatial scale beyond routine mapping. This area, however, has not yet been studied in the context of the magnitude of the floods. The present study incorporates the LISA methodology including Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the occurrence of flooding from super cyclone Amphan across 16 coastal districts of Bangladesh. Using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, "water" and "land" were classified for the pre-event (16 May 2020) and post-events (22 May, 28 May, and 7 June 2020) of the area under study. A Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and visual comparison were used to evaluate the flood maps. A compelling agreement was accomplished between the observed and predicted flood maps, with an overall precision of above 95% for all SAR classified images. As per this study, 2233 km(2) (8%) of the region is estimated to have been inundated on 22 May. After this point, the intensity and aerial expansion of flood decreased to 1490 km(2) by 28 May before it increased slightly to 1520 km(2) (2.1% of the study area) on 7 June. The results from LISA indicated that the main flooding hotspots were located in the central part, particularly in the region off the north-east of the mangrove forest. A total of 238 Unions (smallest administrative units) were identified as high flooding hotspots (p < 0.05) on 22 May, but the number of flooding hotspots dropped to 166 in the second week (28 May) after Amphan subsided before it increased to a further 208 hotspots (p < 0.05) on 7 June due to incessant rainfall and riverbank failure in the south-west part of the study area. As such, an appropriate, timely, and cost-effective strategy would be to assess existing flooding management policies through the identified flooding hotspot regions. This identification would then allow for the creation of an improved policy to help curtail the destructive effects of flooding in the future.

TI  - The Use of Remotely Sensed Data and Polish NFI Plots for Prediction of Growing Stock Volume Using Different Predictive Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growing stock volume (GSV) is an important parameter in the context of forest resource management. National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are routinely used to estimate forest parameters, including GSV, for national or international reporting. Remotely sensed data are increasingly used as a source of auxiliary information for NFI data to improve the spatial precision of forest parameter estimates. In this study, we combine data from the NFI in Poland with satellite images of Landsat 7 and 3D point clouds collected with airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology to develop predictive models of GSV. We applied an area-based approach using 13,323 sample plots measured within the second cycle of the NFI in Poland (2010-2014) with poor positional accuracy from several to 15 m. Four different predictive approaches were evaluated: multiple linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest and Deep Learning fully connected neural network. For each of these predictive methods, three sets of predictors were tested: ALS-derived, Landsat-derived and a combination of both. The developed models were validated at the stand level using field measurements from 360 reference forest stands. The best accuracy (RMSE% = 24.2%) and lowest systematic error (bias% = -2.2%) were obtained with a deep learning approach when both ALS- and Landsat-derived predictors were used. However, the differences between the evaluated predictive approaches were marginal when using the same set of predictor variables. Only a slight increase in model performance was observed when adding the Landsat-derived predictors to the ALS-derived ones. The obtained results showed that GSV can be predicted at the stand level with relatively low bias and reasonable accuracy for coniferous species, even using field sample plots with poor positional accuracy for model development. Our findings are especially important in the context of GSV prediction in areas where NFI data are available but the collection of accurate positions of field plots is not possible or justified because of economic reasons.

TI  - Classification of Active Fires and Weather Conditions in the Lower Amur River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most wildland fires in boreal forests occur during summer, but major fires in the lower Amur River Basin of the southern Khabarovsk Krai (SKK) mainly occur in spring. To reduce active fires in the SKK, we carried out daily analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) hotspot (HS) data and various weather charts. HS data of 17 years from 2003 were used to identify the average seasonal fire occurrence. Active fire-periods were extracted by considering the number of daily HSs and their continuity. Weather charts, temperature maps, and wind maps during the top 12 active fire-periods were examined to clarify each fire weather condition. Analysis results showed that there were four active fire-periods that occurred in April, May, July, and October. Weather charts during the top active fire-periods showed active fires in April and October occurred under strong wind conditions (these wind velocities were over 30 km h(-1)) related to low-pressure systems. The very active summer fire at the end of June 2012 occurred related to warm air mass advection promoted by large westerly meandering. We showed clear fire weather conditions in the SKK from March to October. If a proper fire weather forecast is developed based on our results, more efficient and timely firefighting can be carried out.

TI  - Development of land surface microwave emissivity retrieval using satellite observations
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Review
AB  - Microwave surface emissivity over land is more complex and variable, resulting in more difficult in using microwave data to retrieval atmospheric parameters and assimilating microwave data into numerical model over land. Therefore, it is crucial to provide accurate microwave land surface emissivity over land. With rapid development of satellite observations, abundant passive microwave measurements directly from space have been widely used to retrieve microwave surface emissivity over land. Aim to more advanced microwave imagers and sounders on satellite, substantial works have been implemented to estimate microwave surface emissivity over land. Different types of surface emissivity retrieval methods are established, and the surface emissivity parameterization method is developed and applied to the satellite data assimilation. For the issues exist in currently emissivity retrieval using satellite observation, the related assessment on different retrieving methods and corrected method have been concerned. There are some works focusing on land surface microwave emissivity in domestic, however, it is lack of systemic and comprehensive study in a long run. In particular to the unique and complex land characteristic over China, it is necessary to enhance the understand of the performance of emissivity retrieval methods and the data quality of retrieved microwave surface emissivity as well as its operational application over land in China.

TI  - Introducing a Farmer-Assisted Biomass Estimation (FABE) model using satellite images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the wheat biomass for yield prediction in regional to global scales is of particular importance, especially in food security. So far, many studies have been conducted in this subject where almost in all of them either satellite data or climatological data have been deployed. In the present study, first, some commonly used models including empirical and conventional Monteith models for wheat biomass estimate on have been evaluated where the results were found to be not quite satisfactory. Then a model named FABE, based on the farmer-provided auxiliary data along with the satellite and climatological data has been introduced. The uncertainty of the FABE model in estimating biomass was 193 (gm(-2))with relative RMSE of about 0.31. This shows significant improvement compared to models such as Monteith (RMSE = 224 (gm(-2))and relative RMSE = 0.36). It is shown that the biomass prediction improves if it benefits from farmer-supplied auxiliary data including wheat farms location, watering system, and digital photographs to fill up the gaps due to the satellite missing pixels/images. Accurate biomass estimation may improve the prediction of the yield. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Greenery exposure and suicide mortality later in life: A longitudinal register-based case-control study
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Exposure to residential greenery accumulates over people's lifetimes, and possibly has a protective association with suicide later in life.Objectives: To examine the associations between suicide mortality and long-term residential greenery exposure in male and female adults.Methods: Our population-based nested case-control study used longitudinally georeferenced Dutch register data. Suicide cases aged 18-64 years between 2007 and 2016 were matched by gender, age, and date of suicide to 10 random controls. We measured long-term greenery exposure along people's 10-year residential address histories through longitudinal normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) from Landsat satellite imagery between 1997 and 2016. We assigned accumulated greenery exposures, weighted by people's exposure duration, within 300, 600, and 1,000 m concentric buffers around home addresses. To assess associations between suicide and greenery, we estimated gender-specific conditional logistic regressions without and with adjustment for individual-level and area-level confounders. Stratified models were fitted for areas with a high/low level of urbanicity and movers/non-movers.Results: Our study population consisted of 9,757 suicide cases and 95,641 controls. In our models adjusted for age, gender, and date of suicide, the odds ratios decreased significantly with higher quartiles of accumulated NDVI scores. NDVI associations were attenuated and did not remain significant after adjustment for socioeconomics, urbanicity, air pollution, social fragmentation, etc. for either males or females. For females, but not males, our model with 300 m buffers for areas with a low level of urbanicity showed a significant suicide risk reduction with increasing levels of NDVI. Individual risk factors (e.g., lack of labor market participation) outweighed the contribution of greenery.Conclusion: We found limited evidence that long-term greenery exposure over people's lifetimes contributes to resilience against suicide mortality. Ensuring exposure to greenery may contribute to suicide prevention for specific population groups, but the effectiveness of such exposure should not be overstated.

TI  - Combining Environmental Footprint Models, Remote Sensing Data, and Certification Data towards an Integrated Sustainability Risk Analysis for Certification in the Case of Palm Oil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the potential impacts of the growing Bioeconomy (BE) is a crucial precondition for the development of viable and sustainable strategies. Potential environmental consequences from resource production for the German Bioeconomy can be assessed with the concept of environmental footprint modelling. Furthermore, remote sensing and sustainability certification are tools that can support risk assessment and mitigation i.e., regarding land use (change), biodiversity, carbon stocks, and water consumption. Thus, they can complement the results of footprint models and produce assessment results with a much higher resolution. Among other things, this can enable the development of strategies for more sustainable production practices in high-risk areas and avoid potential bans of biomass imports from entire countries/regions. The conducted case study on palm oil in this paper shows intersections between indicators used in sustainability certification systems and in footprint modelling considering processes on plantation and mill levels. Local best practices for the sustainable production of biomass are identified through a literature review and are extended by a survey, which evaluates the feasibility and conditions of implementing the selected practices on plantations. The conceptual approach outlined in this paper can be seen as a first step towards an integrated sustainability risk analysis of processes and products used within the BE that might be further developed from this starting point. It takes into account footprint modelling data, the use of sustainability certification systems, and data and results from remote sensing analyses. This will enable low-risk producers of renewable resources, who are located in regions generally flagged as high-risk when using environmental footprint modelling, not to be excluded from market activities but to set best practice examples that can then be expanded into these regions.

AB  - There is an active debate regarding the influence that climate has on the risk of armed conflict, which stems from challenges in assembling unbiased datasets, competing hypotheses on the mechanisms of climate influence, and the difficulty of disentangling direct and indirect climate effects. We use gridded historical non-state conflict records, satellite data, and land surface models in a structural equation modeling approach to uncover the direct and indirect effects of climate on violent conflicts in Africa and the Middle East (ME). We show that climate-conflict linkages in these regions are more complex than previously suggested, with multiple mechanisms at work. Warm temperatures and low rainfall direct effects on conflict risk were stronger than indirect effects through food and water supplies. Warming increases the risk of violence in Africa but unexpectedly decreases this risk in the ME. Furthermore, at the country level, warming decreases the risk of violence in most West African countries. Overall, we find a non-linear response of conflict to warming across countries that depends on the local temperature conditions. We further show that magnitude and sign of the effects largely depend on the scale of analysis and geographical context. These results imply that extreme caution should be exerted when attempting to explain or project local climate-conflict relationships based on a single, generalized theory.

TI  - Upscaling Household Survey Data Using Remote Sensing to Map Socioeconomic Groups in Kampala, Uganda
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-Saharan African cities are expanding horizontally, demonstrating spatial patterns of urban sprawl and socioeconomic segregation. An important research gap around the geographies of urban populations is that city-wide analyses mask local socioeconomic inequalities. This research focuses on those inequalities by identifying the spatial settlement patterns of socioeconomic groups within the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (Uganda). Findings are based on a novel dataset, an extensive household survey with 541 households, conducted in Kampala in 2019. To identify different socioeconomic groups, a k-prototypes clustering method was applied to the survey data. A maximum likelihood classification method was applied on a recent Landsat-8 image of the city and compared to the socioeconomic clustering through a fuzzy error matrix. The resulting maps show how different socioeconomic clusters are located around the city. We propose a simple method to upscale household survey responses to a larger study area, to use these data as a base map for further analysis or urban planning purposes. Obtaining a better understanding of the spatial variability in socioeconomic dynamics can aid urban policy-makers to target their decision-making processes towards a more favorable and sustainable future.

TI  - Beyond Truth and Integrity in State Budgeting: Why State Governments Use Budget Balancing Maneuvers (or Gimmicks)?
T2  - PUBLIC BUDGETING AND FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the influence of political, structural, economic, and other factors on state governments' use of maneuvers to balance budgets and eliminate deficits from FY 15 to FY 18. Budget maneuvers are unsound and nonsustainable strategies, such as using borrowed funds to finance operations and underfunding pensions. These practices were documented and graded by The Volcker Alliance for all states and years in collaboration with faculty and students at multiple universities. Consistent with prior research that uses an adaptation framework to explain the strategies government officials use to balance budgets, this research finds that state financial condition has the strongest effect or one of the strongest effects on states' use of such budget gimmicks.

TI  - Land use and above-ground biomass changes in a mountain ecosystem, northern Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of forests into agricultural lands is a major cause of deforestation, particularly in the mountain ecosystems of northern Thailand. It results in a rapid loss of biological diversity of both flora and fauna. In addition, the above-ground biomass (AGB), which can be a major source of carbon storage, is also decreased. This study aimed to predict the AGB in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park, Chiang Mai province, based on land-use/land cover (LULC) changes from 2000 to 2030. Landsat-5 TM (2000) and Landsat-8 TM (2015) satellite images were analyzed to predict LULC changes to 2030. Temporary plots (30 m x 30 m) were established in each LULC type for AGB analysis; trees with diameters at breast height >= 4.5 cm were identified and measured. AGB of all LULC types were analyzed based on specific allometric equations of each type. The results show that area of forest and non-forested areas fluctuated during the study period. Through the first 15 years (2000-2015), 5% (2.9 km(2)) of forest changed to either agriculture or urban lands, especially mixed deciduous forest and lower montane forest. There was a similar trend in the 2030 prediction, showing the effect of forest fragmentation and the resultant high number of patches. Total AGB tended to decrease over the 30-year period from 12.5 to 10.6 t ha(-1)in the first and second periods, respectively. Deforestation was the main factor influencing the loss of AGB (30.6 t ha(-1)) related to LULC changes. Furthermore, habitat loss would be expected to result in decreased biological diversity. Consequently, a management plan should be developed to avoid unsustainable land use changes, which may adversely affect human well-being.

TI  - Tidalectic Curating
T2  - JOURNAL OF CURATORIAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent proliferation of exhibitions about oceans calls for an analysis of their curatorial premises. This article identifies curatorial methodologies consisting of procedures and exhibitions that not only speak about, but also through their oceanic subject matter in a performative way. The term 'tidalectics', coined by the historian and poet Kamau Brathwaite to articulate a worldview that eschews static land and evolves alongside water and flux, serves as an anchor to analyse curatorial work guided by oceanic thinking. The author argues that through a tidalectic methodology - which takes cues from natural processes such as the ebb and flow of the tide - current ecological, societal and onto-epistemological shifts can be addressed productively.

TI  - Coseismic and Postseismic Crustal Deformation Associated With the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake Sequence Revealed by PALSAR-2 Pixel Tracking and InSAR
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coseismic and postseismic crustal deformations caused by earthquake episodes are important in understanding the mechanisms of these episodes as well as the fault rheology near an epicentral area. Specifically, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) pixel tracking can depict high-resolution crustal deformation fields associated with earthquakes and volcanic activities without installing on-site observation instruments. In this study, we investigate the coseismic and postseismic near-fault crustal deformations associated with the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence in southwest Japan using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 (Phased Array-type L-band SAR-2) data. Coseismic three-dimensional (3-D) displacement fields inferred from PALSAR-2 pixel tracking data showed 1.6 m of horizontal displacements and 2 m of subsidence at maximum, despite the mainshock focal mechanism that was dominated by strike-slip components with N-S extension axes. The locations of large displacement variations along surface ruptures due to the mainshock were almost identical to a region where infrastructure was damaged, thus implying the generation of strong ground seismic waves. By using conventional InSAR stacking, we inferred two independent quasi-east-west and quasi-vertical displacement fields as cumulative postseismic deformations following the mainshock over a period of about 2 years. The near-fault postseismic deformation represented complicated displacement characteristics that could not be explained by a single physical process. Deformation signals around Aso volcano were interpreted by the effects of postseismic physical processes as well as geological heterogeneous structures.Plain Language Summary Coseismic and postseismic crustal deformation fields provide information for inferring slip distributions occurring along a fault, and these data are helpful for understanding the geological characteristics around an epicentral area. By using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, we can derive crustal deformation maps with high spatial resolutions and high measurement accuracy without installing on-site observation instruments. In this paper, we offer coseismic and postseismic crustal deformation maps associated with the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence on Kyushu Island, SW Japan, which were derived using the Japanese SAR satellite ALOS- 2/PALSAR-2 data. Measurements of displacements along with details on Earth surface ruptures due to earthquakes also allow us to understand the variations in rupture processes along seismogenic faults. Furthermore, comparisons of the spatial and temporal variations of coseismic and postseismic deformations can provide information on the geophysical mechanisms of long-term deformations following a mainshock.

TI  - Diversified floral provisioning enhances performance of the generalist predator, <i>Orius</i> <i>insidiosus</i> (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing nectar and pollen through the establishment of insectary plants is one approach to conserving natural enemies and enhancing biological control of arthropod pests. Recent studies show that natural enemy performance may be influenced by the diversity of insectary plant species and the resources they provide. We conducted laboratory assays to investigate the influence of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) alone and in a mixture on the performance of the insidious flower bug, Orius insidiosus (Say, 1832). We measured performance as longevity, fecundity and predation of O. insidiosus reared on a laboratory diet of Ephestia kuehniella or its field prey, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). O. insidiosus survived on average 20-25% longer and oviposited 67-88% more eggs when provided with either insectary species compared to a water only control. However, when provided with a biculture of cowpea and buckwheat, O. insidiosus survived 35% longer and laid 111% more eggs compared to the water only control, with a strong preference for cowpea as an oviposition host. This study provides novel empirical evidence that cowpea, a plant anecdotally cited for its insectary properties, functions as a preferred oviposition sites compared to buckwheat and laboratory standard green beans. The presence of insectary resources, however, did not significantly influence predation on O. nubilalis sentinel prey by O. insidiosus as we anticipated. These results indicate that the performance of beneficial insects like O. insidious may be differentially influenced by the resources provided by insectary species and should be screened for potential benefits before establishing in field settings. Further implications of plant diversification for conservation biological control are discussed.y

TI  - Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series-Based Assessment of the Impact of Severe Salinity Intrusion Events on Spatiotemporal Changes in Distribution of Rice Planting Areas in Coastal Provinces of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security has become a key global issue due to rapid population growth, extensive conversion of arable lands, and declining overall productivity in some areas because of the effects of floods, water shortage, salinity intrusion, and plant diseases. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the pattern of salinity intrusion and the spatiotemporal distribution of rice cultivation in the winter-spring crops of 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2020 in coastal provinces of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Sentinel-1 (S-1) data were used to extract the spatial distribution information of six rice growth stages based on a rice age algorithm. The classification accuracy of rice crop growth stages was found to have an overall accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.80 (n = 373). For evaluating salinity intrusion effects, salinity isolines (4 g/L) were used to determine the percentage of rice areas affected. Results show that in the years observed to have severe salinity intrusion such as 2016 and 2020, a strong shift in planting calendar was identified to avoid salinity intrusion, with some areas being sown or transplanted 10-30 days earlier than normal planting. In addition, the lack of irrigation water and salinity intrusion limits rice cultivation in the dry season of coastal areas. Further analysis from the S-1 data confirms that the spatiotemporal distribution of rice cultivation is related to the change in government policy/recommendation affected by salinity intrusion. These findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of using S-1 data to develop an operational rice crop adaptation framework on the delta scale.

TI  - Wide-Area Near-Real-Time Monitoring of Tropical Forest Degradation and Deforestation Using Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Sentinel-1 (S1) radar for wide-area, near-real-time (NRT) tropical-forest-change monitoring is discussed, with particular attention to forest degradation and deforestation. Since forest change can relate to processes ranging from high-impact, large-scale conversion to low-impact, selective logging, and can occur in sites having variable topographic and environmental properties such as mountain slopes and wetlands, a single approach is insufficient. The system introduced here combines time-series analysis of small objects identified in S1 data, i.e., segments containing linear features and apparent small-scale disturbances. A physical model is introduced for quantifying the size of small (upper-) canopy gaps. Deforestation detection was evaluated for several forest landscapes in the Amazon and Borneo. Using the default system settings, the false alarm rate (FAR) is very low (less than 1%), and the missed detection rate (MDR) varies between 1.9% +/- 1.1% and 18.6% +/- 1.0% (90% confidence level). For peatland landscapes, short radar detection delays up to several weeks due to high levels of soil moisture may occur, while, in comparison, for optical systems, detection delays up to 10 months were found due to cloud cover. In peat swamp forests, narrow linear canopy gaps (road and canal systems) could be detected with an overall accuracy of 85.5%, including many gaps barely visible on hi-res SPOT-6/7 images, which were used for validation. Compared to optical data, subtle degradation signals are easier to detect and are not quickly lost over time due to fast re-vegetation. Although it is possible to estimate an effective forest-cover loss, for example, due to selective logging, and results are spatiotemporally consistent with Sentinel-2 and TerraSAR-X reference data, quantitative validation without extensive field data and/or large hi-res radar datasets, such as TerraSAR-X, remains a challenge.

TI  - Exponentially decaying modes and long-term prediction of sea ice concentration using Koopman mode decomposition
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctic is an important indicator of changes in the climate, with important environmental, economic and security consequences. The complexity of the spatio-temporal dynamics of sea ice makes it difficult to assess the temporal nature of the changes-e.g. linear or exponential-and their precise geographical loci. In this study, Koopman Mode Decomposition (KMD) is applied to satellite data of sea ice concentration for the Northern and Southern hemispheres to gain insight into the temporal and spatial dynamics of the sea ice behavior and to predict future sea ice behavior. We observe spatial modes corresponding to the mean and annual variation of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice concentration and observe decreases in the mean sea ice concentration from early to later periods, as well as corresponding shifts in the locations that undergo significant annual variation in sea ice concentration. We discover exponentially decaying spatial modes in both hemispheres and discuss their precise spatial extent, and also perform predictions of future sea ice concentration. The Koopman operator-based, data-driven decomposition technique gives insight into spatial and temporal dynamics of sea ice concentration not apparent in traditional approaches.

TI  - One Health Approach to Leishmaniases: Understanding the Disease Dynamics through Diagnostic Tools
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Review
AB  - Leishmaniases are zoonotic vector-borne diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania that affect millions of people around the globe. There are various clinical manifestations, ranging from self-healing cutaneous lesions to potentially fatal visceral leishmaniasis, all of which are associated with different Leishmania species. Transmission of these parasites is complex due to the varying ecological relationships between human and/or animal reservoir hosts, parasites, and sand fly vectors. Moreover, vector-borne diseases like leishmaniases are intricately linked to environmental changes and socioeconomic risk factors, advocating the importance of the One Health approach to control these diseases. The development of an accurate, fast, and cost-effective diagnostic tool for leishmaniases is a priority, and the implementation of various control measures such as animal sentinel surveillance systems is needed to better detect, prevent, and respond to the (re-)emergence of leishmaniases.

TI  - Classification of Ice in Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica, Using Data from ASCAT and AMSR2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an ice classification algorithm based on combined active and passive microwave radiometer data in Lutzow-Holm Bay (LHB), East Antarctica. The ice classification algorithm is developed based on the threshold values of an advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) and advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (here, AMSR2). These values are calculated via the features of various ice types, including open ice, first-year (FY) ice, multi-year (MY) ice, MY ice including icebergs (MY IB), ice shelves, coastal ice sheets, and inland ice sheets. To verify the validity of the ice classification algorithm, the algorithm results are compared with visual observation data and satellite imagery. Except for the flaw polynya and area with surface melting, the FY ice, MY ice, and the ice shelf areas estimated here using the proposed ice classification algorithm match those discernible from the verification data. Inter-annual changes in the areal extents of FY ice, MY ice, and the ice shelves are investigated here using the proposed ice classification algorithm. Investigation of MY ice and ice shelf areas revealed that the breakup of MY ice induced a breakup of an ice shelf. A comparison of the FY ice and MY ice areas showed the replacement of these ice types. The proposed ice classification algorithm can detect ice breakup events as quantitative changes in the distribution and ice type. In future work, we plan to classify sea ice in other sea ice areas, applying the proposed algorithm throughout the Antarctic region.

TI  - Study on surface thermal environment differentiation effect in mining intensive area through developing remote sensing assessment model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of mineral resources has promoted rapid economic growth, but it has also caused mining areas to have increased surface thermal flux, which has a negative impact on the ecological environment. In this study, using on Landsat satellite remote sensing images of the study area from 2000 to 2018, the radiative transfer equation method was used to invert Land Surface Temperature (LST). VFC in the study area was inverted based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) -Dry Fuel Index (DFI) three-component pixel model. Mixed pixels were decomposed into Photosynthetic Vegetation (PV). Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) , and Bare Soil (BS). Based on the four ecological parameters, Factional Cover of Photosynthetic Vegetation (f(PV)), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Bare Soil Index (BSI), a remote sensing integrated ecological index (RSIEI) model which can comprehensively evaluate the differentiation effect of the surface thermal environment in mining intensive areas is proposed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The relationship between the differentiation effect of the surface thermal environment and the quality of the ecological environment was studied using the heat island variation index. The results showed that the NDVI-DFI feature space of the study area conforms to the basic assumption of the three-component pixel model. And the four ecological parameters are closely related to the differentiation effect of the surface thermal environment. From the regression equation of the four ecological parameters and LST in study area over three years, it can be seen that f(PV) and NDMI has a significant linear negative correlation with LST (p<0.01); NDBI and BSI have a significant linear positive correlation with LST (p<0.01). The spatial distribution of normalized RSIEI images and normalized LST images of study area showed an inverse spatial correlation, i. e. , the areas with high RSIEI (good ecological quality) in the study area correspond to the areas with low LST and vice versa. The quantitative regression analysis of RSIEI and LST in 3 years in 4 mining intensive areas shows that, when RSIEI is increased by 10%, LST was decreased by 0. 67 - 0. 77 degrees C. It is proved that the RSIEI model based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is suitable for the comprehensive evaluation of the surface thermal environment differentiation effect in mining intensive areas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal divergence in the responses of Finland's boreal forests to climate variables
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring greening in boreal forest ecosystems has been widely linked to increasing temperature, but few studies have attempted to unravel the relative effects of climate variables such as maximum temperature (TMX), minimum temperature (TMN), mean temperature (TMP), precipitation (PRE) and radiation (RAD) on vegetation growth at different stages of growing season. However, clarifying these effects is fundamental to better understand the relationship between vegetation and climate change. This study investigated spatio-temporal divergence in the responses of Finland's boreal forests to climate variables using the plant phenology index (PPI) calculated based on the latest Collection V006 MODIS BRDF-corrected surface reflectance products (MCD43C4) from 2002 to 2018, and identified the dominant climate variables controlling vegetation change during the growing season (May-September) on a monthly basis. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to quantify the response of PPI to climate variables and distinguish the separate impacts of different variables. The study results show the dominant effects of temperature on the PPI in May and June, with TMX, TMN and TMP being the most important explanatory variables for the variation of PPI depending on the location, respectively. Meanwhile, drought had an unexpectedly positive impact on vegetation in few areas. More than 50 % of the variation of PPI could be explained by climate variables for 68.5 % of the entire forest area in May and 87.7 % in June, respectively. During July to September, the PPI variance explained by climate and corresponding spatial extent rapidly decreased. Nevertheless, the RAD was found be the most important explanatory variable to July PPI in some areas. In contrast, the PPI in August and September was insensitive to climate in almost all of the regions studied. Our study gives useful insights on quantifying and identifying the relative importance of climate variables to boreal forest, which can be used to predict the possible response of forest under future warming.

TI  - Anthropogenic transformation of Yangtze Plain freshwater lakes: patterns, drivers and impacts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past half century, the Yangtze Plain of China has experienced rapid economic development. Lake reclamation (i.e., conversion of natural lake/wetland areas to agricultural/urban land or aquaculture, thereby reducing the area of natural waters) in particular has greatly contributed to meeting the increasing demands for food and urban development. However, until now, a comprehensive quantification and understanding of historical anthropogenic lacustrine exploitation in this region has been lacking, prohibiting assessment of the impacts of these activities. We used Landsat observations from 1973 to 2018 to track reclamation-induced changes in 112 large lakes (97.8% of the total lake area) in the Yangtze Plain. We show that 41.6% (6056.9 km(2)) of the total lake area has been reclaimed since the 1970s. The expansion of agricultural and built-up lands dominated the reclamation activities in the 1970s, while the increase of aquaculture zones has prevailed since the mid-1980s. Reclamation activities were closely connected to government policies and major socio-economic events and had strong impacts on lake hydrology, flood risk mitigation capacity, and water quality as revealed by satellite and in situ observations. This new quantitative understanding of anthropogenic reclamation and its associated impacts on Yangtze Plain freshwater lakes can underpin the development of strategies to reduce the impacts of lake reclamation on environmental quality. The study has also demonstrated the unique strength of using long-term series satellite images in tracking historical environmental changes in a substantial region of the world, and the methods used here are potentially extendable to other inland and coastal areas to understand similar human-environment interaction problems.

TI  - Observed Variability of the North Atlantic Current in the Rockall Trough From 4 Years of Mooring Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rockall Trough is one of the main conduits for warm Atlantic Water to the Nordic Seas. Ocean heat anomalies, originating from the eastern subpolar gyre, are known to influence Arctic sea ice extent, marine ecosystems, and continental climate. Knowledge of the transport through this basin has previously been limited to estimates from hydrographic sections which cannot characterize the intra-annual and multiannual variability. As part of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Programme (OSNAP), a mooring array was deployed in the Rockall Trough in order to obtain the first continuous measurements of transport. Here, we define the methodology and the errors associated with estimating these transports. Results show a 4-year mean northward transport of 6.6 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) by the North Atlantic Current (NAC) in the east and interior of the Rockall Trough (2014-2018). A mean transport of -2.0 Sv (southward) is observed in the west of the basin, which could be part of a recirculation around the Rockall Plateau. The 90-day low-pass-filtered transport shows large subannual and interannual variability (-1.6 to 9.1 Sv), mostly resulting from changes in the midbasin geostrophic transport. Satellite altimetry reveals the periods of low and high transport are associated with significant changes in the Rockall Trough circulation. There is a detectable seasonal signal, with the greatest transport in spring and autumn.Plain Language Summary There is mounting evidence that the North Atlantic Current (eastward extension of the Gulf Stream) heavily influences the European and Arctic climate. To adequately measure this current and understand its dynamics, an array of underwater instruments was deployed in the Rockall Trough, a remote region of the eastern North Atlantic. Over a 4-year period, these instruments continuously collected measurements of temperature, salinity, pressure, and velocity data. Analysis of these data provides a new and more accurate description of the North Atlantic Current in this region. This study reveals a surprisingly large variability in the eastern North Atlantic circulation. The combined analysis of underwater measurements and satellite data indicates that this variability is due to changes of the North Atlantic Current system.Key PointsFor the first time, the strength of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) has been measured continuously for four years in the Rockall Trough During 2014 to 2018, about half the amount of warm water travelling northwards towards the Arctic Ocean flows through the Rockall Trough High northward transport periods are characterized by a strong NAC jet in the Rockall Trough, weak transport by mesoscale eddy activity

T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryAfter the results of many trials, it is now accepted to omit axillary dissection in selected patients with limited axillary involvement. However, the external validity of these trials is questionable. Our study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the real French population representativity in the SERC (Sentinelle Envahi et Randomisation du Curage) trial population for patients with breast cancer (BC) associated with sentinel node (SN) micro-metastasis and the differences between the studied population and the real French population. The secondary aim was to compare the French and the Swedish populations of patients with SN micro-metastasis. The findings of our study in addition to the previously demonstrated concordance between the SENOMIC (Sentinelle node Micrometastasis) trial and the Swedish National Breast Cancer Registry (NKBC) populations implied that the results of both the SERC and the SENOMIC trials can be applied to both the French and Swedish real populations.Many trials confirmed the safety of omitting axillary dissection in the selected patients treated for early breast cancer. The external validity of these trials is questionable. Our study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the French population representativity in the SERC trial and the differences between these two populations as well as comparing the French and the Swedish populations (the SENOMIC trial population and the Swedish National Breast Cancer Registry (NKBC) cohort) of patients with sentinel node (SN) micro-metastasis. A higher rate of smaller tumors and grade 1 tumors was observed in the French cohort when compared to the SERC population. Our findings conclude that both French populations show similar characteristics. Positive non-sentinel node (NSN) rates at completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were 10.28 % and 11.3 % in the SERC trial and French cohort, respectively (p = 0.5). The rate of grade 1 tumors was lower in the SENOMIC trial (16.2%) and in the NKBC cohort (17.4%) compared to the SERC trial population (27.3%) and the French cohort (34.4%). Our findings in addition to the previously demonstrated concordance between the SENOMIC trial and the NKBC populations imply that the results of both the SERC and the SENOMIC trials can be applied to both French and Swedish real populations.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Changes and the Relationship with Land Surface Temperature Using Landsat and MODIS Imageries in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous regions are more sensitive to climatic condition changes and are susceptible to recent increases in temperature. Due to urbanization and land use/land cover (LULC) issues, Cameron Highlands has been impacted by rising land surface temperature (LST) variation. Thus, this study was carried out to explore the impact of the LULC change on LST in the Cameron Highlands from 2009 to 2019 using remote sensing images acquired from Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI/TIRS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 11A Thermal sensors. A split-window algorithm was applied to Landsat 8 images (2013-2019) to derive the LST. Air temperature data of the study area were also obtained to cross-validate data sources. Based on the validation results, the accuracy of LULC and LST outputs were more than 94.6% and 80.0%, respectively. The results show that the current trend of urban growth continues at a rate of 0.16% per year, and the area experienced an LST increase of 2 degrees C between 2009 and 2019. This study is crucial for land planners and environmentalists to understand the impacts of LULC change on LST and to propose appropriate policy measures to control development in Cameron Highlands.

TI  - Improved estimates of monthly land surface temperature from MODIS using a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) has been widely used to understand surface energy exchange and surface radiation budget and is a critical input of earth system models for carbon and water cycles studies at regional to global scales. Spatially and temporally consistent thermal measurements with long historical records are in a high demand to understand the biophysical changes of Earth surfaces. The current monthly LST products' spatial resolutions are relatively coarse and the temporal and spatial consistency could be interrupted by the presence of clouds and satellite orbit limitations. This study develops a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model-based approach from MODIS observations that are suitable for constructing the long-term and near-global coverage of monthly LSTs at 1 km to fill these data gaps. The new approach allows us to estimate temporally representative 24-hr mean and maximum temperatures in a diurnal cycle of each month. We performed an inter-comparison among satellite-based data, including DTC-based MODIS estimates, the simple composite of four MODIS overpasses, and the hourly geostationary observations (GEO), and also assessed the satellite-based LST against in-situ LSTs from FLUXNET globally. Our proposed DTC-based mean LSTs outperformed the other two satellite estimates from the simple composite and GEO, showing a mean difference of 0.3 degrees C and an RMSE of 2.2 degrees C relative to the in-situ measurements. Moreover, we illustrate an application that explores the relationship between the DTC-based monthly LSTs and the soil moisture anomalies across the United States. The monthly maximum LSTs estimated from DTC scheme show higher sensitivity to droughts than the monthly mean. In sum, the improved monthly LST dataset using DTC scheme can enhance our understanding of the thermal dynamics resulting from land-atmosphere interaction across the local, regional, and global scales.

TI  - Advancing the Mapping of Mangrove Forests at National-Scale Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data with Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A high resolution mangrove map (e.g., 10-m), including mangrove patches with small size, is urgently needed for mangrove protection and ecosystem function estimation, because more small mangrove patches have disappeared with influence of human disturbance and sea-level rise. However, recent national-scale mangrove forest maps are mainly derived from 30-m Landsat imagery, and their spatial resolution is relatively coarse to accurately characterize the extent of mangroves, especially those with small size. Now, Sentinel imagery with 10-m resolution provides an opportunity for generating high-resolution mangrove maps containing these small mangrove patches. Here, we used spectral/backscatter-temporal variability metrics (quantiles) derived from Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and/or Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) time-series imagery as input features of random forest to classify mangroves in China. We found that Sentinel-2 (F1-Score of 0.895) is more effective than Sentinel-1 (F1-score of 0.88) in mangrove extraction, and a combination of SAR and MSI imagery can get the best accuracy (F1-score of 0.94). The 10-m mangrove map was derived by combining SAR and MSI data, which identified 20003 ha mangroves in China, and the area of small mangrove patches (<1 ha) is 1741 ha, occupying 8.7% of the whole mangrove area. At the province level, Guangdong has the largest area (819 ha) of small mangrove patches, and in Fujian, the percentage of small mangrove patches is the highest (11.4%). A comparison with existing 30-m mangrove products showed noticeable disagreement, indicating the necessity for generating mangrove extent product with 10-m resolution. This study demonstrates the significant potential of using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to produce an accurate and high-resolution mangrove forest map with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The mangrove forest map is expected to provide critical information to conservation managers, scientists, and other stakeholders in monitoring the dynamics of the mangrove forest.

TI  - Overview of on-orbit calibration for the thermal emissive band of the FY-3C MERSI and its performance
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) on the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite has been operated for many years and provide a large number of science data for studying the global climate change and natural disaster monitoring. To maintain the measurement accuracy, on-orbit calibration are conducted regularly. This paper provide an overview of FY-3C/MERSI Thermal Emissive Band (TEB) calibration and its performance. By using the on-board data taken on June 2014, the variation tendency of BB temperature are analyzed, which shows some slight changes but less than 0.35 %. To consider the stability of instrument, there have differences between different detectors and different sides of the scan mirrors, but for a certain detector, the variation is within +/- 0.5 %, which shows the performance of MERSI is very stable.

TI  - Aquifer deformation and active faulting in Salt Lake Valley, Utah, USA
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquifers and fault zones may interact through groundwater flow and stress redistribution, yet their spatiotemporal relationship remains enigmatic. Here we quantify changes in water storage and associated stress along the Wasatch Fault Zone in Salt Lake Valley, recently shaken by a M5.7 earthquake on March 18th, 2020. Ground deformation mapped by Sentinel-1 SAR imagery (2014-2019) reveals an elongated area with similar to 50-mm seasonal uplift corresponding to 0.03-0.06-km(3) water storage cycles. Phase shifts across active faults in both water level and deformation suggest control by the low-permeability structures. The seasonal stress changes on the adjoining faults from poroelastic volume strain are two orders of magnitude larger than those from hydrological surface loading, but both are small compared to the annual increase of tectonic loading at seismogenic depths. Historic seismic events, limited in number, do not exhibit statistically significant annual periodicity and hydrological modulation of microseismicity or triggering of the recent M5.7 event is not evident.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in global soil respiration and their relationships with climate and land cover
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration (Rs) represents the largest flux of CO2 from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere, but its spatial and temporal changes as well as the driving forces are not well understood. We derived a product of annual global Rs from 2000 to 2014 at 1 km by 1 km spatial resolution using remote sensing data and biome-specific statistical models. Different from the existing view that climate change dominated changes in R-s, we showed that land-cover change played a more important role in regulating R-s changes in temperate and boreal regions during 2000-2014. Significant changes in R-s occurred more frequently in areas with significant changes in short vegetation cover (i.e., all vegetation shorter than 5 m in height) than in areas with significant climate change. These results contribute to our understanding of global Rs patterns and highlight the importance of land-cover change in driving global and regional Rs changes.

TI  - Intensified burn severity in California's northern coastal mountains by drier climatic condition
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The severity of wildfire burns in interior lands of western US ecosystems has been increasing. However, less is known about its coastal mountain ecosystems, especially under extreme weather conditions, raising concerns about the vulnerability of these populated areas to catastrophic fires. Here we examine the fine-scale association between burn severity and a suite of environmental drivers including explicit fuel information, weather, climate, and topography, for diverse ecosystems in California's northern coastal mountains. Burn severity was quantified using Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat multispectral imagery during 1984-2017. We found a significant increasing trend in burned areas and severity. During low-precipitation years, areas that burned had much lower fuel moisture and higher climatic water deficit than in wetter years, and the percentage of high-severity areas doubled, especially during the most recent 2012-2016 drought. The random forest (RF) machine learning model achieved overall accuracy of 79% in classifying categories of burn severity. Aspect, slope, fuel type and availability, and temperature were the most important drivers, based on both classification and regression RF models. We further examined the importance of drivers under four climatic conditions: dry vs. wet years, and during two extended drought periods (the 2012-2016 warmer drought vs. the 1987-1992 drought). During warm and dry years, the spatial variability of burn severity was a mixed effect of slope, long-term minimum temperature, fuel amount, and fuel moisture. In contrast, climatic water deficit and short-term weather became dominant factors for fires during wetter years. These results suggest that relative importance of drivers for burn severity in the broader domain of California's northern coastal mountains varied with weather scenarios, especially when exacerbated by warm and extended drought. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting areas with high burn severity risk for fire adaptation and mitigation strategies in a changing climate and intensifying extremes.

TI  - Joint Analysis and Weighted Synthesis Sparsity Priors for Simultaneous Denoising and Destriping Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe and random noise are two different degradation phenomena that commonly coexist in optical remote sensing images, and they are often modeled as inverse problems. In model-based inverse problems, analysis and synthesis sparse representations (SSRs) are used as regularization terms to obtain approximate solutions due to their respective merits, i.e., the nonzero coefficients in SSR are usually used to describe an image, while the indexes of zeros in analysis sparse representation (ASR) are used to characterize the stripe. Inspired by these merits, we propose a unified variational framework, called a joint analysis and weighted synthesis (JAWS) sparsity model, to simultaneously separate the clean image and the stripe from a single optical remote sensing image. To solve the JAWS sparsity model efficiently, an alternating minimization optimization strategy is first employed to separate it into two subproblems that are used for different tasks. One called as weighted SSR (WSSR) is the main for optical remote sensing image denoising, which can be effectively solved by employing the weighted singular value thresholding operator, while the other called as ASR is the main approach for optical remote sensing image destriping, which is optimized by adopting the split Bregman iteration. By minimizing the two subproblems alternatively, the proposed JAWS sparsity model is efficiently solved. Finally, both quantitative and qualitative results of experiments on synthetic and real-world optical remote sensing images validate that the proposed approach is effective and even better than the state of the arts.

TI  - Emergency department use during COVID-19 as described by syndromic surveillance
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 12 March 2020 the UK entered the 'delay phase' of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The Public Health England Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS) carries out daily (near real-time) public health surveillance of emergency department (ED) attendances across England. This retrospective observational analysis of EDSSS data aimed to describe changes in ED attendances during March-April 2020, and identify the attendance types with the largest impact. Type 1 ED attendances were selected from 109 EDs that reported data to EDSSS for the period 1 January 2019 to 26 April 2020. The daily numbers of attendances were plotted by age group and acuity of presentation. The 2020 'COVID-19' period (12 March 2020 to 26 April 2020) attendances were compared with the equivalent 2019 'pre-COVID-19' period (14 March 2019 to 28 April 2019): in total; by hour and day of the week; age group(<1, 1-4, 15-14, 1544, 45-64 and 65+ years); gender; acuity; and for selected syndromic indicators(acute respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, myocardial ischaemia). Daily ED attendances up to 11 March 2020 showed regular trends, highest on a Monday and reduced in children during school holidays. From 12 March 2020 ED attendances decreased across all age groups, all acuity levels, on all days and times. Across age groups the greatest percentage reductions were seen in school age children (5-14 years). By acuity, the greatest reduction occurred in the less severe presentations. Syndromic indicators showed that the greatest reductions were in non-respiratory indicators, which fell by 44-67% during 2020 COVID-19, while acute respiratory infection was reduced by -4.4% (95% CI -9.5% to 0.6%). ED attendances in England have been particularly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic due to changes in healthcare seeking behaviour. EDSSS has enabled real-time daily monitoring of these changes, which are made publicly available to facilitate action. The EDSSS provides valuable surveillance of ED attendances in England. The flexibility of EDSSS allowed rapid development of new indicators (including COVID-19-like) and reporting methods.

AB  - Background: This study aims to assess multimodal pain management and opioid prescrib-ing practices in patients undergoing breast surgery.Methods: A retrospective review of patients undergoing breast surgery at an academic medical center between April 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019, was performed. Patients with a history of recent opioid use or conditions precluding use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen (APAP) were excluded. Opioid-sparing pain regimens were assessed. Opioids prescribed on discharge were recorded as oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) and concordance with the Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network (OPEN) determined.Results: The total study population consisted of 518 patients. 358 patients underwent minor outpatient procedures (sentinel lymph node biopsy, lumpectomy, and excisional biopsy), 10-40% of whom were appropriately prescribed as per the OPEN. Perioperatively, 53.9% of patients received APAP, 24.6% NSAIDs, 20.4% gabapentin, and 0.3% blocks; intraoperatively, 95.8% received local anesthetic and 25.7% ketorolac. For mastectomy without reconstruc-tion, 63-88% of prescriptions were concordant with the OPEN. For mastectomy with reconstruction, discharge opioids ranged from 25 to 400 OMEs with a mean of 134.4 OMEs; 25% of patients received a refill. Of all patients undergoing mastectomy +/- reconstruction, 62.5% received APAP, 18.8% NSAIDs, 38.8% pregabalin, and 20.6% locoregional block peri-operatively; 37.5% received local anesthetic and 15.6% ketorolac intraoperatively. Of 143 inpatient stays, 89% received APAP, 38% NSAID, and 29% benzodiazepines; 29 patients received no opioids inpatient but were still prescribed 25-200 OMEs on discharge.Conclusions: There is need for a multidisciplinary approach to pain management with the use of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols as potential means to standardize peri-operative regimens and mitigate opioid overprescription.

TI  - Testing NDVI, tree cover density and land cover type as fuel indicators in the wildfire spread capacity index (WSCI): case of Montenegro
T2  - NOTULAE BOTANICAE HORTI AGROBOTANICI CLUJ-NAPOCA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces the fuel properties into the wildfire spreading capacity index (WSCI), which originally relies on multi-criteria of social, hydro-meteorological, and geo-physical character of the context. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Tree Cover Density (TCD), and land cover type are launched as indicators of fuel properties of the vegetated surfaces being indexed. The materials and software utilized here belong to a variety of open sources. CORINE Land Cover (CLC), Open Street Map (OSM), TCD via Copernicus high resolution data, and multispectral satellite images via Landsat 8 (Semi-Automatic Classification PluginSCP) are utilized as raw materials in a workflow in QGIS software. The study area is Montenegro, a Mediterranean territory prone to wildfire risk. Following the inventory stage, the indexing method relies on a normalizing procedure in QGIS and the assignment of weighted impact factor to each criterion via analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The WSCI value is derived as the sum of the products between the normalized class and the respective weighted impact factor of each criterion. The validation phase relies on ROC curve of WSCI values utilizing burned areas as positive cases. The results show high wildfire spreading capacities of vegetated areas of significant socio-economic and environmental profile such as the coastal zone along Adriatic Sea and the trans-boundary regions as part of Balkan Green Belt. Besides the methodological improvements the results of this work deliver tangible outputs in support of forest fire risk reduction means within disaster risk management and fire safety agendas in Montenegro.

AB  - This paper introduces the implementation of space remote sensing and detecting systems of oceangoing ships as an alternative to the Radio - Automatic Identification System (R-AIS), Satellite - Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT), and other current vessel tracking systems. In this paper will be not included a new project known as a Global Ship Tracking (GST) as an autonomous and discrete satellite network designed by the Space Science Centre (SSC) for research and postgraduate studies in Satellite Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) at Durban University of Technology (DUT). The ship detection from satellite remote sensing imagery system is a crucial application for maritime safety and security, which includes among others ship tracking, detecting and traffic surveillance, oil spill detection service, and discharge control, sea pollution monitoring, sea ice monitoring service, and protection against illegal fisheries activities. The establishment of a modern sea surface and ships monitoring system needs enhancement of the Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SSAR) that is here discussed as a modern observation infrastructure integrated with Ships Surveillance and Detecting via SSAR TerraSAR-X Spacecraft, Ships Surveillance and Detecting via SSAR Radarsat Spacecraft and Vessels Detecting System (VDS) via SSAR.

M3  - Article
AB  - We present our next-generation surface water mapping model, DeepWaterMapV2, which uses improved model architecture, data set, and a training setup to create surface water maps at lower cost, with higher precision and recall. We designed DeepWaterMapV2 to be memory efficient for large inputs. Unlike earlier models, our new model is able to process a full Landsat scene in one-shot and without dividing the input into tiles. DeepWaterMapV2 is robust against a variety of natural and artificial perturbations in the input, such as noise, different sensor characteristics, and small clouds. Our model can even "see" through the clouds without relying on any active sensor data, in cases where the clouds do not fully obstruct the scene. Although we trained the model on Landsat-8 images only, it also supports data from a variety of other Earth observing satellites, including Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Sentinel-2, without any further training or calibration. Our code and trained model are available at https://github.com/isikdogan/deepwatermap.

AB  - Sufism, as the largest mystical and ethical movement in Islam, had the widest influence on all spheres of life in Islamic society, including traditional medicine. For more than a thousand years, the healing that Sufis practiced has been one of the main forms of medical assistance offered to the population in the Islamic world. In this study, Sufi medicine is considered as a traditional system of healing that has specific features (transnational and synthetic, a combination of religious and medical practices, the active use of psychotherapeutic techniques). The significant influence of the Sufi worldview on the philosophy of the great thinkers and naturalists of the Islamic Renaissance (Abu Ali Ibn Sina, Jabir ibn Hayyan, Al-Biruni) is also highlighted.

TI  - A Major Ecosystem Shift in Coastal East African Waters During the 1997/98 Super El Nino as Detected Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the impact of natural and anthropogenic climate variability, upwelling systems are known to change their properties leading to associated regime shifts in marine ecosystems. These often impact commercial fisheries and societies dependent on them. In a region where in situ hydrographic and biological marine data are scarce, this study uses a combination of remote sensing and ocean modelling to show how a stable seasonal upwelling off the Kenyan coast shifted into the territorial waters of neighboring Tanzania under the influence of the unique 1997/98 El Nino and positive Indian Ocean Dipole event. The formation of an anticyclonic gyre adjacent to the Kenyan/Tanzanian coast led to a reorganization of the surface currents and caused the southward migration of the Somali-Zanzibar confluence zone and is attributed to anomalous wind stress curl over the central Indian Ocean. This caused the lowest observed chlorophyll-a over the North Kenya banks (Kenya), while it reached its historical maximum off Dar Es Salaam (Tanzanian waters). We demonstrate that this situation is specific to the 1997/98 El Nino when compared with other the super El-Nino events of 1972,73, 1982-83 and 2015-16. Despite the lack of available fishery data in the region, the local ecosystem changes that the shift of this upwelling may have caused are discussed based on the literature. The likely negative impacts on local fish stocks in Kenya, affecting fishers' livelihoods and food security, and the temporary increase in pelagic fishery species' productivity in Tanzania are highlighted. Finally, we discuss how satellite observations may assist fisheries management bodies to anticipate low productivity periods, and mitigate their potentially negative economic impacts.

TI  - Evidence That Reduced Air and Road Traffic Decreased Artificial Night-Time Skyglow during COVID-19 Lockdown in Berlin, Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial skyglow, the brightening of the night sky by artificial light at night that is scattered back to Earth within the atmosphere, is detrimental to astronomical observations and has an impact on ecosystems as a form of light pollution. In this work, we investigated the impact of the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban skyglow of Berlin, Germany. We compared night sky brightness and correlated color temperature (CCT) measurements obtained with all-sky cameras during the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 with data from March 2017. Under normal conditions, we expected an increase in night sky brightness (or skyglow, respectively) and CCT because of the transition to LED. This is supported by a measured CCT shift to slightly higher values and a time series analysis of night-time light satellite data showing an increase in artificial light emission in Berlin. However, contrary to this observation, we measured a decrease in artificial skyglow at zenith by 20% at the city center and by more than 50% at 58 km distance from the center during the lockdown. We assume that the main cause for the reduction of artificial skyglow originates from improved air quality due to less air and road traffic, which is supported by statistical data and satellite image analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported impact of COVID-19 on artificial skyglow and we conclude that air pollution should shift more into the focus of light pollution research.

AB  - In this manuscript, the UNet++ model, which is one of the representative deep learning techniques for semantic segmentation, was used to detect changes in temporal satellite images. To analyze the learning results according to various loss functions, we evaluated the change detection results using trained UNet++ models by binary cross entropy and the Jaccard coefficient. In addition, the learning results of the deep learning model were analyzed compared to existing pixel-based change detection algorithms by using WorldView-3 images. In the experiment, it was confirmed that the performance of the deep learning model could be determined depending on the characteristics of the loss function, but it showed better results compared to the existing techniques.

TI  - Tracking long-term floodplain wetland changes: A case study in the China side of the Amur River Basin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain wetlands in the China side of the Amur River Basin (CARB) undergone consistent decreases because of both natural and anthropogenic drivers. Monitoring floodplain wetlands dynamics and conversions over longtime periods is thus fundamental to sustainable management and protection. Due to complexity and heterogeneity of floodplain environments, however, it is difficult to map wetlands accurately over a large area as the CARB. To address this issue, we developed a novel and robust classification approach integrating image compositing algorithm, objected-based image analysis, and hierarchical random forest classification, named COHRF, to delineate floodplain wetlands and surrounding land covers. Based on the COHRF classification approach, 4622 Landsat images were applied to produce a 30-m resolution dataset characterizing dynamics and conversions of floodplain wetlands in the CARB during 1990-2018. Results show that (1) all floodplain land cover maps in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018 had high mapping accuracies (ranging from 90% +/- 0.001-97% +/- 0.005), suggesting that COHRF is a robust classification approach; (2) CARB experienced an approximately 25 % net loss of floodplain wetlands with an area declined from 8867 km(2) to 6630 km(2) during 1990-2018; (3) the lost floodplain wetlands were mostly converted into croplands, while, there were 111 km(2) and 256 km(2) of wetlands rehabilitated from croplands during periods of 2000-2010 and 2010-2018, respectively. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt that focus on delineating floodplain wetlands at a large-scale and produce the first 30-m spatial resolution dataset demonstrating long-term dynamics of floodplain wetlands in the CARB. The COHRF classification approach could be used to classify other ecosystems readily and robustly. The resultant dataset will contribute to sustainable use and conservation of wetlands in the Amur River Basin and provide essential information for related researches.

TI  - Modeling Forest Aboveground Carbon Density in the Brazilian Amazon with Integration of MODIS and Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely updates of carbon stock distribution are needed to better understand the impacts of deforestation and degradation on forest carbon stock dynamics. This research aimed to explore an approach for estimating aboveground carbon density (ACD) in the Brazilian Amazon through integration of MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) and a limited number of light detection and ranging (Lidar) data samples using linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. Airborne LiDAR data at 23 sites across the Brazilian Amazon were collected and used to calculate ACD. The ACD estimation model, which was developed by Longo et al. in the same study area, was used to map ACD distribution in the 23 sites. The LR and RF methods were used to develop ACD models, in which the samples extracted from LiDAR-estimated ACD were used as dependent variables and MODIS-derived variables were used as independent variables. The evaluation of modeling results indicated that ACD can be successfully estimated with a coefficient of determination of 0.67 and root mean square error of 4.18 kg C/m(2) using RF based on spectral indices. The mixed pixel problem in MODIS data is a major factor in ACD overestimation, while cloud contamination and data saturation are major factors in ACD underestimation. These uncertainties in ACD estimation using MODIS data make it difficult to examine annual ACD dynamics of degradation and growth, however this method can be used to examine the deforestation-induced ACD loss.

TI  - Large-Scale and High-Resolution Crop Mapping in China Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale, high-resolution mapping of crop patterns is useful for the assessment of food security and agricultural sustainability but is still limited. This study attempted to establish remote sensing-based crop classification models for specific cropping systems using the decision trees method and monitored the distribution of the major crop species using Sentinel-2 satellites (10 m) in 2017. The results showed that the cropping areas of maize, rice, and soybean on the Northeast China Plain were approximately 12.1, 6.2, and 7.4 million ha, respectively. The cropping areas of winter wheat and summer maize on the North China Plain were 13.4 and 16.9 million ha, respectively. The cropping areas of wheat, rice, and rape on the middle-lower Yangtze River plain were 2.2, 6.4 and 1.3 million ha, respectively. Estimated images agreed well with field survey data (average overall accuracy = 94%) and the national agricultural census data (R-2 = 0.78). This indicated the applicability of the Sentinel-2 satellite data for large-scale, high-resolution crop mapping in China. We intend to update the crop mapping datasets annually and hope to guide the adjustment and optimization of the national agricultural structure.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Organic Matter Using Visible-Short Near-Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is a crucial indicator of soil fertility and an important form of global soil carbon. It is the premise and basis of ensuring food security and assessing climate change to estimate SOM content and its changes rapidly. The traditional method of SOM determination is time-consuming with the high cost and environmental risks. Soil reflectance spectroscopy can be faster and cheaper than the conventional method, do not generate chemical residues and are non-destructive to the samples. However, spatial interpolation technique was still needed to map SOM after estimation of SOM in a point soil sample by reflectance spectroscopy. Imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) collects a spectral curve for each pixel, which enlarges the envelope of point spectrometry into a spatial domain and provides a technical basis for spatial mapping of SOM. This novel technique has not yet been fully utilized for SOM mapping. Therefore, the spectral index established by laboratory visible-short near-infrared imaging spectroscopy data can be used to estimate SOM and explore the mechanism, which lays a theoretical foundation for SOM mapping of remote sensing. In this study, a spectral index, named deviation of an arch (DOA), was established using the information of three wavelengths. The correlation between DOA and SOM was analyzed by the scatter diagram. Then, the samples were randomly split into training and validation data sets for 1 000 times. Nonlinear regression and partial least square regression (PLSR) were used to calibrate DOA or spectroscopy to SOM, respectively. The performances were compared to explore the feasibility of SOM estimation using imaging spectroscopy. The results indicate that the SOM content in the study area was relatively low, and its variation range was large. There was a significant logarithmic relationship between DOA and SOM. Logarithm function can be used to model DOA and SOM and provide reasonable and stable results. The performance of DOA regression is better than PLSR. The possible reason is that the spectral data used by PLSR contains some information unrelated to SOM, which affects the accuracy of PLSR. We can conclude that this spectral index, DOA, can be used for SOM mapping, although it is deduced from three wavelengths. It provides a new idea and methods for SOM mapping based on satellite remote sensing data in the future.

TI  - Geolocation Accuracy Improvement of Multiobserved GF-3 Spaceborne SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the first C-band full-polarization spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite in China, Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is of great significance in scientific research and economic development. Thanks to the advantage of all-weather and all-day observation, spaceborne SAR imagery is widely used in digital elevation model (DEM) generation, target tracking, and so on. And, all these applications are based on the high 3-D geolocation accuracy of SAR imagery. Therefore, a new slant range error update model and an error-source-based weight strategy which can effectively improve the 3-D geolocation accuracy of multiobserved data set from GF-3 satellite are proposed in this letter. The slant range error update model is proposed to improve the 3-D geolocation accuracy using the virtual control information in height direction. At the same time, an error-source-based weight strategy is introduced as an appendant to the multiobservation block adjustment model based on the rational function model (RFM). The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve a much higher 3-D geolocation accuracy than the traditional methods.

TI  - Theoretical and experimental investigation of six-degree-of-freedom force/thrust measurement stand
T2  - IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thrust testing units with a piezoelectric dynamometer have unique traits such as excessive stiffness, tremendous measurement accuracy, dynamic performance and no hysteresis. These are widely used in the applications requiring force/thrust measurements in the aerospace industry and high-end tool condition monitoring. The performance of these units is necessary to be evaluated. In this study, an improved layout of six-degree of freedom force/thrust measurement stand is proposed and analysed theoretically and experimentally. The measurement stand is a structural component to measure six components of force, such as axial force/thrust (F-X,F-Y, andF(Z)) and other components (M-X,M-Y, andM(Z)). Test stand consists of seven piezoelectric sensors in two sections. The front part consists of four piezoelectric force sensors, while the rear part consists of three sensors. The rear section is hexagonal, with three sensors mounted at 120 degrees. The measurement stand can measure the principal force/thrust up to 50,000 N. A mathematical model is derived for every sensor against forces in all directions. To calibrate the stand, a calibration platform is designed and fabricated. The calibration platform can generate a range of forces/moments. Calibration experiments verifies that the measurement stand is fairly functional to measure variety of forces/moments with high repeatability.

TI  - Assessment of Google Trends terms reporting allergies and the grass pollen season in Ukraine
T2  - WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Grass pollen allergy is an important trigger for the development of respiratory disorders. Defining the grass pollen season onset is critical for correct allergy diagnosis and personalized therapy. The development of a pan-European sentinel network for allergic diseases has raised the problem of translating the Google search terms into different European languages as well as defining specific pollen season characteristics in different regions. Grass pollen allergy was investigated due to high allergenicity and wide expansion of grass pollen in Europe.Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine which translations of "hay fever", "grass", and "rhinitis" could be used in the native Cyrillic languages, especially in Ukrainian and Russian, and to compare the seasonality of allergic respiratory queries in Ukraine with the grass pollen counts.Methods: Google Trends (GT) was used to search Google queries concerning grass pollen allergy: "allergy", "hay fever", "runny nose", "grass", "asthma", and "pollen". The Cyrillic terms in Ukrainian and Russian were used. The search was done for the period from 2013 to 2017. Pollen collection from 2013 to 2016 was conducted using volumetric methods. Average daily temperatures were obtained from http://gismeteo.ua. Correlations were assessed by Spearman (R) test.Results: The Ukrainian Google users searched the Cyrillic equivalents for "runny nose", "grass", and "asthma". Due to the GT queries profile, Ukraine had a "D" pattern according to the classification, developed by Bousquet J et al (2017). In Ukraine, the Poaceae pollen season generally occurred between the second ten-day period of May and the last ten-day period of July. The Poaceae pollen season started with a concentration of pollen grains of 8.0 m(-3). This concentration provoked the growth of GT "grass", "allergy", "hay fever", and "asthma" queries.Conclusions: The terms "grass", "allergy", "hay fever", and "asthma" (in their Cyrillic equivalents) are required in Ukraine to account for the grass pollen exposure by GT. The study of GT may be a useful tool to make an assessment of the grass pollen season for the prevention and minimization of exposure to significant grass pollen concentrations.

TI  - Image Collection Simulation Using High-Resolution Atmospheric Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method is described for simulating the passive remote sensing image collection of ground targets that includes effects from atmospheric physics and dynamics at fine spatial and temporal scales. The innovation in this research is the process of combining a high-resolution weather model with image collection simulation to attempt to account for heterogeneous and high-resolution atmospheric effects on image products. The atmosphere was modeled on a 3D voxel grid by a Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) driven by forcing data constrained by local ground-based and air-based observations. The spatial scale of the atmospheric model (10-100 m) came closer than conventional weather forecast scales (10-100 km) to approaching the scale of typical commercial multispectral imagery (2 m). This approach was demonstrated through a ground truth experiment conducted at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site. In this experiment, calibrated targets (colored spectral tarps) were placed on the ground, and the scene was imaged with WorldView-3 multispectral imagery at a resolution enabling the tarps to be visible in at least 9-12 image pixels. The image collection was simulated with Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) software, using the 3D atmosphere from the LES model to generate a high-resolution cloud mask. The high-resolution atmospheric model-predicted cloud coverage was usually within 23% of the measured cloud cover. The simulated image products were comparable to the WorldView-3 satellite imagery in terms of the variations of cloud distributions and spectral properties of the ground targets in clear-sky regions, suggesting the potential utility of the proposed modeling framework in improving simulation capabilities, as well as testing and improving the operation of image collection processes.

TI  - Multisource Assessments of the FengYun-3D Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) On-Orbit Performance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The microwave humidity sounder (MWHS) onboard the Fengyun-3D satellite is providing the data for profiling atmospheric temperature and moisture and has become an important data source for improving the weather forecasts. In this article, three data sources are utilized for assessing the MWHS on-orbit performance, including Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder (GNOS), ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) Re-Analysis (ERA)-Interim reanalysis, and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) data. GNOS-retrieved atmospheric profiles and the reanalysis data are used as inputs to the community radiative transfer model (CRTM) for simulating the MWHS brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere in July 2018 for characterizing the instrument performance. Since ATMS is a well-calibrated microwave sounding instrument onboard both Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, its measurements are also collocated with MWHS data for a consensus analysis using the simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) method. In comparing GNOS simulations, MWHS upper air temperature sounding channels (36) have relatively larger biases (less than 2.5 K) than the water vapor sounding channels. However, the standard deviation of the difference between observations and simulations (O-B) is larger for water vapor sounding channels. For ERA simulations, MWHS sounding channels exhibit negative biases similar to GNOS results but the standard deviation of O-B at the water vapor channels is much smaller. When compared with ATMS water vapor channels, MWHS biases are mostly negative and agree with those from ERA simulation. Thus, the large uncertainty in simulating MWHS water vapor sounding channels from GNOS could result from the poor input water vapor profiles and high water vapor variability in the lower troposphere.

TI  - Landsat.based investigation on the wetland landscape dynamics and human threats in four Ramsar sites over the Yunnan.Guizhou Plateau
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We used five Landsat remote sensing images from 1977 to 2015, acquired land cover data based on an object.oriented classification method, and explored wetland area changes in four Ramsar sites in the Yunnan.Guizhou Plateau. With landscape metrics, dynamic index and human disturbance index, we analyzed the effects of human stress on wetlands and the protective effi. ciency in the four Ramsar sites over the plateau. Results showed that total area of wetlands de. creased by 7.6% (i.e. 299 hm(2)) in the past 38 years, with direct human occupation as the most important driver. Human disturbance index increased from 7.4% in 1977 to 13.5% in 2015. Dur. ing the 38 years, landscape fragmentation index and patch number increased, whereas aggrega. tion degree and contagion decreased. Changes in these landscape metrics indicated obvious frag. mentation of wetland landscapes. There were differences in changes of wetland landscapes among the four Ramsar sites. Wetland landscape in Lashihai and Dashanbao changed dramatically with human stresses. Wetland landscape in Bitahai and Napahai changed slightly with better protection effects. Our results can provide scientific basis for wetland protection and sustainable management in the Yunnan.Guizhou Plateau.

TI  - Are Nomograms Useful in Predicting Upstage From Ductal Carcinoma In Situ to Invasive Carcinoma Requiring Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy?
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - The upstage rate from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on core biopsy to invasive carcinoma at definitive excision ranges from 20 to 30%. Nomograms have been developed to aid in the prediction of upstaging so as to guide surgical planning with respect to performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of these nomograms to predict upstaging within our public hospital population. A retrospective review of patients with DCIS from 2013 to 2018 at a single institution was performed. Individualized probability of upstage was calculated using the Samsung Medical Center (SMC) and Annals of Surgical Oncology (ASO) nomograms. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to assess the discriminative power of each. Of 105 patients with DCIS, 31 (29.5%) were upstaged to invasive disease. The SMC and ASO nomograms demonstrated area under the curves (AUCs) of .65 (OR = 1.023, 95% CI 1.004-1.042, P = .02) and .60 (OR = 1.035, 95% CI 1.003-1.068, P = .03), respectively. While SMC provided greater discrimination in our cohort, the performance of these nomograms as reliable clinical adjuncts to guide SLNB decision-making in this cohort was less than optimal and thus should not be the sole factor in determining individual upstage risk.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an analysis of the mean atmospheric column nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) over the Republic of North Macedonia during a six-month period. Measurements of NO2 and CO obtained from the recently launched Sentinel-5 Precursor spacecraft with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (Sentinel-5P TROPOMI) have been used. The aim of this study was to use relatively high-resolution satellite data for local air quality/air pollution monitoring and to investigate the relation of the pollutants with geographical and demographical data of the study area. For that purpose, along with CO and NO2 data from TROPOMI, population statistics, digital elevation model and vegetation cover have been used for geo-spatial and statistical analyses. The findings show significantly high CO and NO2 values in several parts of the study area, especially high CO values in the Vardar and Polog Valleys, and high NO2 values in the densely populated cities. According to the analyses, there is high positive correlation between the NO2 and the population statistics (r = 0.78; R-2 = 0.61) and high negative correlation (r = -0.9; R-2 = 0.80) between the altitude and the CO values of the study area. The overall results of this study confirmed the capability of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data to be used in monitoring the air quality and air pollution over local areas.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With a plethora of digital elevation models (DEM) available for elevation extraction and catchment morphometric analysis, it is essential to compare and investigate their accuracy and parameter uncertainty derived from them. To serve that purpose, in this study, we have compared the DEMs of different resolution obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), CARTOSAT, and topographic maps (1:25000) in terms of vertical accuracy and morphometric parameters. The investigation was performed on a sub-basin of Champavathi River which is located in Andhra Pradesh, the southern part of India. The vertical accuracy of the DEMs was estimated using elevation from about 1180 points obtained from the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) survey. The morphometric analysis showed that the basin is elongated with low relief ratio, mild/rolling slopes, and medium drainage density, and the results were comparable from different DEM sources indicating that most of the morphometric parameters were not significantly dependent on the scale and source of the DEM. Further, vertical accuracy estimation showed that the CARTOSAT DEMs (10 m and 30 m) have a lower root mean square error (4.53 m and 5.89 m) when compared with the SRTM DEMs (6.11 m and 7.19 m).

AB  - Gaussian processes are popular and flexible models for spatial, temporal, and functional data, but they are computationally infeasible for large data sets. We discuss Gaussian-process approximations that use basis functions at multiple resolutions to achieve fast inference and that can (approximately) represent any spatial covariance structure. We consider two special cases of this multi-resolution approximation framework, namely a taper version and a domain-partitioning (block) version. We describe theoretical properties and inference procedures, and study the computational complexity of the methods. Numerical comparisons and an application to satellite data are also provided.

TI  - Utilizing Advance Texture Features for Rapid Damage Detection of Built Heritage Using High-Resolution Space Borne Data: A Case Study of UNESCO Heritage Site at Bagan, Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heritage sites are vulnerable to damage due to social, anthropological and environmental factors. Major Earthquakes are followed by damage to cultural heritage buildings. The assessment of such building damage is a critical problem. Earth Observation data, owing to its property of being non-contact, cost effective, synoptic view and high repeatability, has a significant role to play in estimation of damage in the earthquake affected areas. Currently, several and varied types of remote sensing data have become available, and therefore, appropriate methods for rapid assessment and analysis of the data need to be developed. Rapid damage assessment is critical to minimize loss in terms of life and property. In case of cultural monuments, rapid assessment can minimize damage and help in the conservation of monument. This research focuses on evolving a robust method for rapid identification and extraction of damaged heritage building structures, especially those affected by disasters such as earthquakes. In this study, we propose to examine the utility of advance texture algorithms such as Gabor, fractal and semi-variogram for rapid damage detection in heritage building structures. The methodology attempts to automatically highlight damaged portions of the structure through a knowledge driven rule set. The technique was able to extract the damaged area from the heritage building structure with the use of high-resolution space borne data. It is observed that feature extraction algorithms based on fractal and variogram provide better results than the Gabor based textures and are very useful in the case of high-resolution satellite imagery. Both the methods are able to extract damaged features in both shadowed and non-shadowed regions of the image. Hence the problems posed by shadowed dead grounds on EO data can be effectively resolved. However, it is also observed that the advance texture feature extraction algorithms are useful only in case of high-spatial resolution dataset and has limited use for rapid damage assessment from medium and low resolution datasets.

AB  - Sound is a compelling and effective performance device for art concerned with social justice because of its ability to situate a performer, an audience, and a performance in cultural, historical, and political contexts. This article details the creative process of the author, which includes speaking the text aloud prior to writing it on the page in order to prioritize how the words sound together instead of how they visually appear on the page. Critically, this practice creates a focused consideration of the use of space on the page to invite practitioners and audience members to explore their own imaginations at moments in the performance without text as a guide. The hope is that prioritizing the embodiment of sound in the creation and writing process will facilitate practitioners' and audience members' ability to experience this new play, What We Deserve (an excerpt of which is included in this article), on stage and the page, not only as an interrogation of systems of oppression but also as an expression of a worldview that centres justice.

In the present study artificial recharge sites were delineated using the important factors which plays a pivotal role in groundwater occurrence through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based modelling in Geographical Information System (GIS) environment. Datasets from different sources and Landsat-8 satellite images were used to assign the weightage for different parameters in accordance to their role in site selection for artificial recharging. The study shows that the sub-watershed-1 lies in the southwestern upland of Agra district and sub-watershed-2 which is located in Firozabad district, occupies an area of 304 Km(2) (42%) and 248 Km(2) (35%) respectively, found under critical groundwater condition in terms of declining groundwater level. These sites are located mainly around the settlement areas of relatively higher elevation. Overall, 26% area (i.e., very low water level class in the study area) in the presented study exhibit poor groundwater conditions (i.e., 32-42 m bgl) and hence required an immediate treatment in terms of artificial technology in order to enrich the water stressed alluvial aquifers.

TI  - Epidemiology of Cholera in Bangladesh: Findings From Nationwide Hospital-based Surveillance, 2014-2018
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Despite advances in prevention, detection, and treatment, cholera remains a major public health problem in Bangladesh and little is known about cholera outside of limited historical sentinel surveillance sites. In Bangladesh, a comprehensive national cholera control plan is essential, although national data are needed to better understand the magnitude and geographic distribution of cholera.Methods. We conducted systematic hospital-based cholera surveillance among diarrhea patients in 22 sites throughout Bangladesh from 2014 to 2018. Stool specimens were collected and tested for Vibrio cholerae by microbiological culture. Participants' socioeconomic status and clinical, sanitation, and food history were recorded. We used generalized estimating equations to identify the factors associated with cholera among diarrhea patients.Results. Among 26 221 diarrhea patients enrolled, 6.2% (n = 1604) cases were V. cholerae 01. The proportion of diarrhea patients positive for cholera in children <5 years was 2.1% and in patients >= 5 years was 9.5%. The proportion of cholera in Dhaka and Chittagong Division was consistently high. We observed biannual seasonal peaks (pre- and postmonsoon) for cholera across the country, with higher cholera positivity during the postmonsoon in western regions and during the pre-monsoon season in eastern regions. Cholera risk increased with age, occupation, and recent history of diarrhea among household members.Conclusions. Cholera occurs throughout a large part of Bangladesh. Cholera-prone areas should be prioritized to control the disease by implementation of targeted interventions. These findings can help strengthen the cholera-control program and serve as the basis for future studies for tracking the impact of cholera-control interventions in Bangladesh.

TI  - Improving middle and high latitude cloud liquid water path measurements from MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Three years of measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on Aqua satellite has been used to develop a new approach to quantify the well-known, yet unresolved zonal bias in MODIS LWP of marine clouds. This new method utilizes two parameters: the solar zenith angle and cloud heterogeneity index, both of which are available for each MODIS pixel. Comparisons with collocated satellite and ground-based microwave measurements in carefully screened clouds shows that this new approach can effectively remove this large first order MODIS LWP bias. Applying this new approach to MODIS pixel level data collocated along the CloudSat footprint suggests annually averaged MODIS LWP overestimation gradually increases at higher latitudes and can reach over 50 g/m(2) at latitudes greater than around 50. This overestimation can exceed 100 g/m(2) for seasonal or monthly averages. MODIS LWP measurements were also reprocessed over land and snow/ice regions by eliminating data points with optical depth of 150, which indicates significant 3D bias. This reduces the average LWP by over 100 g/m(2) in polar regions. The new and improved MODIS LWP dataset can be used to study related cloud processes and to constrain model simulations, especially in polar regions where observational dataset is limited and contain large uncertainties.

TI  - Assessment of Forest Biomass Estimation from Dry and Wet SAR Acquisitions Collected during the 2019 UAVSAR AM-PM Campaign in Southeastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation from SAR backscatter is affected by varying imaging and environmental conditions. This paper quantifies and compares the performance of forest biomass estimation from L-band SAR backscatter measured selectively under dry and wet conditions during the 2019 AM-PM NASA airborne campaign. Seven Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) images acquired between June and October 2019 over a temperate deciduous forest in Southeastern United States with varying moisture and precipitation conditions are examined in conjunction with LIDAR and field measurements. Biomass is estimated by fitting a 3-parameter modified Water Cloud Model (WCM) to radiometric terrain corrected SAR backscatter. Our experiment is designed to quantify the biomass estimation errors when biomass models are calibrated and validated on varying acquisition conditions (dry or wet). Multi-temporal estimation strategies are also evaluated and compared with single-acquisition estimation approaches. As an outcome, the experiment shows that the WCM model calibrated and validated on single acquisitions adapts to different soil moisture conditions with RMSD up to 18.7 Mg/ha. The AGB estimation performance, however, decreases with RMSD upwards of 30 Mg/ha when the model is cross-validated on moisture and precipitation conditions different than the calibration conditions. Results confirm that calibrating the model over the multi-temporal data using averaged backscatter or weighted combinations of individual AGB estimates, improves the biomass estimation accuracy up to about 20% at L-band. This study helps design biomass cal/val procedures and biomass estimation algorithms for dense time-series to be collected by low-frequency radar missions such as NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) and BIOMASS.

TI  - Transboundary Basins Need More Attention: Anthropogenic Impacts on Land Cover Changes in Aras River Basin, Monitoring and Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land cover (LC) can alter the basin hydrology by affecting the evaporation, infiltration, and surface and subsurface flow processes, and ultimately affect river water quantity and quality. This study aimed to monitor and predict the LC composition of a major, transboundary basin contributing to the Caspian Sea, the Aras River Basin (ARB). To this end, four LC maps of ARB corresponding to the years 1984, 2000, 2010, and 2017 were generated using Landsat satellite imagery from Armenia and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The LC gains and losses, net changes, exchanges, and the spatial trend of changes over 33 years (1984-2017) were investigated. The most important drivers of these changes and the most accurate LC transformation scenarios were identified, and a land change modeler (LCM) was applied to predict the LC change for the years 2027 and 2037. Validation results showed that LCM, with a Kappa index higher than 81%, is appropriate for predicting LC changes in the study area. The LC changes observed in the past indicate significant anthropogenic impacts on the basin, mainly by constructing new reservoir dams and expanding agriculture and urban areas, which are the major water-consuming sectors. Results show that over the past 33 years, agricultural areas have grown by more than 57% from 1984 to 2017 in the study area. Results also indicate that the given similar anthropogenic activities will keep on continuing in the ARB, and agricultural areas will increase by 2% from 2017 to 2027, and by another 1% from 2027 to 2037. Results of this study can support transboundary decision-making processes to analyze potential adverse impacts following past policies with neighboring countries that share the same water resources.

TI  - Study on the Characteristics of Spatial Relationship between Heat Concentration and Heat-deepening Factors Using MODIS Based Heat Distribution Map
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the spatial correlation between the heat distribution map of the satellite imaging base and the factors that deepen the heat wave, and to explore the heat concentration area and the space where the risk of future heat wave may increase. The global Moran's I of population, land use, and buildings, which are the causes of heat concentration and heat wave deepening, is found to be high and concentrated in specific spaces. According to the analysis results of local Moran's I, heat concentration areas appeared mainly in large cities such as metropolitan and metropolitan areas, and forests were dominant in areas with relatively low temperatures. Areas with high population growth rates were distributed in the surrounding areas of Gyeonggi-do, Daejeon, and Busan, and the use of land and buildings were concentrated in the metropolitan area and large cities. Analysis by Bivarate Local Moran's I has shown that population growth is high in heat-intensive areas, and that artificial and urban building environments and land use take place. The results of this research can lead to the ranking of heat concentration areas and explore areas with environments where heat concentration is concentrated nationwide and deepens it, so ultimately it is considered to contribute to the establishment of preemptive measures to deal with extreme heat.

TI  - Detection of Forest Ecosystem Disturbance Using Satellite Images and ISODATA
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent severe climate changes and extreme weather events have caused the uncommon types of forest ecosystem disturbances such as hails and gypsy moths. This paper describes the analysis of the forest ecosystem disturbances using ISODATA (Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm) with the RapidEye and Sentinel-2 images, regarding the cases of the hail damages in Hwasun in 2017 and the gypsy moth damages in the Chiak Mountain in 2020. In the case of hail damages, the comparison of the June image of this study and the July field survey of the previous study showed that the damage severity increased from June to July as the drought overlapped after the trees were injured by the hails. In the case of gypsy moths, significant leaf damages were found from the image of June, and the damages were mainly distributed at the low-altitude slope near Wonju City. We made sure that satellite remote sensing is a very effective method to detect various and unusual forest ecosystem disturbances caused by climate change. Also, it is expected that the Korean Medium Satellite for Agriculture and Forestry scheduled to launch in 2024 can be actively utilized to monitor such forest ecosystem disturbances.

TI  - Extracting Flooded Areas in Southeast Asia Using SegNet and U-Net
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood monitoring using satellite data has been constrained by obtaining satellite images for flood peak and accurately extracting flooded areas from satellite data. Deep learning is a promising method for satellite image classification, yet the potential of deep learning-based flooded area extraction using SAR data remained uncertain, which has advantages in obtaining data, comparing to optical satellite data. This research explores the performance of SegNet and U-Net on image segmentation by extracting flooded areas in the Khorat basin, Mekong river basin, and Cagayan river basin in Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines from Sentinel-1 A/B satellite data. Results show that Global Accuracy, Mean IoU, and Mean BF Score of SegNet are 0.9847, 0.6016, and 0.6467 respectively, whereas those of U-Net are 0.9937, 0.7022, 0.7125. Visual interpretation shows that the classification accuracy of U-Net is higher than SegNet, but overall processing time of SegNet is around three times faster than that of U-Net. It is anticipated that the results of this research could be used when developing deep learning-based flood monitoring models and presenting fully automated flooded area extraction models.

TI  - Active Fire Detection Using Landsat 8 OLI Images: A Case of 2019 Australia Fires
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent global warming and anthropogenic activities have caused more frequent and massive wildfires with longer durations and more significant damages. MODIS has been monitoring global wildfires for almost 20 years, and GK2A and Himawari-8 are observing the wildfires in East Asia 144 times a day. However, the spatial resolution of 1 to 2 km is not sufficient for the detection of small and medium-size active fires, and therefore the studies on the active fire detection using high-resolution images are essential. However, there is no official product for the high-resolution active fire detection. Hence, we implemented the active fire detection algorithm of Landsat 8 and carried out a high-resolution-based detection of active fires in Australia in 2019, followed by the comparisons with the products of Himawari-8 and MODIS. Regarding the intense fires, the three satellites showed similar results, whereas the weak igniting and extinguishing fires or the fires in narrow areas were detected by only Landsat 8 with a 30m resolution. Small-sized fires, which are the majority in Korea, can be detected by the high-resolution satellites such as Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, Kompsat-3A, and the forthcoming Kompsat-7. Also, a comprehensive analysis together with the geostationary satellites in East Asia such as GK2A, Himawari-8, and Fengyun-3 will help the interoperability and the improvement of spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - The Method of Linking Fire Survey Data with Satellite Image-based Fire Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to propose the method of linking satellite image-based forest fire data to supplement the limitation of forest fire survey data that records only the ignition location and area of forest fire. For this purpose, a method was derived to link the fire survey data provided by the Korea Forest Service between January 2012 and December 2019 with MODIS and VIIRS image-based forest fire data. As a result, MODIS and VIIRS-based forest fire data out of 191 wildfires in the forest fire survey data were able to identify 11% and 44% of fire damage area, respectively. An average of 56% of forest damage area was extracted from VIIRS-based forest fire data compared to forest fire areas identified by high-resolution Sentinel-2A satellites. Therefore, for large-scale forest fires, VIIRS wildfire data can be used to compensate for the limitations of forest fire survey data that records only the ignition location and area.

TI  - A CNN-based 3D human pose estimation based on projection of depth and ridge data
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a method that use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate human pose by analyzing the projection of the depth and ridge data, which represent local maxima in a distance transform map. To fully utilize the 3D information of depth points, we propose a method to project the depth and ridge data on various directions. The proposed projection method can reduce the 3D information loss, the ridge data can avoid joint drift, and the CNN increases localization accuracy. The proposed method proceeds as follows. (1) We use depth data to segment the human from the background and extract ridge data from human silhouettes. (2) We project the depth and ridge data onto XY, XZ, and ZY planes. (3) ResNet-101 accepts six projected images and use 1 x 1 convolution layers to generate 2D heatmaps and offsets. (4) We generate 2D keypoints per plane by using the soft-argmax operation. (5) We obtain 3D joint positions by using the fully-connected layers. In experiments on the SMMC-10, EVAL, and ITOP datasets, the proposed method achieved the state-of-the-art pose estimation accuracies. The proposed method can eliminate the 3D information loss and drift of joint positions that can occur during estimation of human pose.

TI  - Challenge for Diagnostic Assessment of Deep Learning Algorithm for Metastases Classification in Sentinel Lymph Nodes on Frozen Tissue Section Digital Slides in Women with Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeAssessing the status of metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by pathologists is an essential task for the accurate staging of breast cancer. However, histopathological evaluation of SLNs by a pathologist is not easy and is a tedious and time-consuming task. The purpose of this study is to review a challenge competition (HeLP 2018) to develop automated solutions for the classification of metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained frozen tissue sections of SLNs in breast cancer patients.Materials and MethodsA total of 297 digital slides were obtained from frozen SLN sections, which include post-neoadjuvant cases (n=144, 48.5%) in Asan Medical Center, South Korea. The slides were divided into training, development, and validation sets. All of the imaging datasets have been manually segmented by expert pathologists. A total of 10 participants were allowed to use the Kakao challenge platform for 6 weeks with two P40 GPUs. The algorithms were assessed in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).ResultsThe top three teams showed 0.986, 0.985, and 0.945 AUCs for the development set and 0.805, 0.776, and 0.765 AUCs for the validation set. Micrometastatic tumors, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, invasive lobular carcinoma, and histologic grade 3 were associated with lower diagnostic accuracy.ConclusionIn a challenge competition, accurate deep learning algorithms have been developed, which can be helpful in making frozen diagnosis of intraoperative SLN biopsy. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting.

TI  - Coastal Wetland Classification with Deep U-Net Convolutional Networks and Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Case Study at the Tien Yen Estuary of Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural wetland areas in Vietnam, which are transition areas from inland and ocean, play a crucial role in minimizing coastal hazards; however, during the last two decades, about 64% of these areas have been converted from the natural wetland to the human-made wetland. It is anticipated that the conversion rate continues to increase due to economic development and urbanization. Therefore, monitoring and assessment of the wetland are essential for the coastal vulnerability assessment and geo-ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to propose and verify a new deep learning approach to interpret 9 of 19 coastal wetland types classified in the RAMSAR and MONRE systems for the Tien Yen estuary of Vietnam. Herein, a Resnet framework was integrated into the U-Net to optimize the performance of the proposed deep learning model. The Sentinel-2, ALOS-DEM, and NOAA-DEM satellite images were used as the input data, whereas the output is the predefined nine wetland types. As a result, two ResU-Net models using Adam and RMSprop optimizer functions show the accuracy higher than 85%, especially in forested intertidal wetlands, aquaculture ponds, and farm ponds. The better performance of these models was proved, compared to Random Forest and Support Vector Machine methods. After optimizing the ResU-Net models, they were also used to map the coastal wetland areas correctly in the northeastern part of Vietnam. The final model can potentially update new wetland types in the southern parts and islands in Vietnam towards wetland change monitoring in real time.

Participants received a package including Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) monitoring, lymphoedema education and support to promote self-management and physical activity.Results Participants adhered to BIS monitoring 74% of the time, and felt extremely confident in using the device. By 6 months, mean BIS L-Dex scores had increased from 3.5 (SD 5.6) to 8.4 (SD 11.1); five women (25%) who experienced > + 6.5 increase in L-Dex score were fitted with a compression garment. Self-reported symptoms and distress decreased by 0.4 out of 10 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.7); number of self-management strategies used increased by 0.6 (95% CI 0.1 to 1.2); and planned exercise increased by 2.8 h/week (95% CI 0.4 to 5.2).Conclusions These findings indicate a prospective surveillance model of care in the home with BIS is feasible and associated with increased self-management. A Phase II randomised trial is warranted as well as research exploring the costs associated with implementing this model of care for high-risk individuals.

TI  - A Machine Learning Framework for Estimating Leaf Biochemical Parameters From Its Spectral Reflectance and Transmission Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral measurements are commonly applied for the nondestructive estimation of leaf parameters, such as the concentrations of chlorophyll a and b, carotenoid, anthocyanin, brown pigment, leaf water content, and leaf mass per area for the quantification of vegetation physiology. The most popular way to estimate these parameters is by using spectral vegetation indices. The use of biochemical models allows us to use the full wavelength range (4002500 nm) and to physically interpret the result. However, their performance is usually lower than that of supervised machine learning regression techniques. Machine learning regression techniques, on the other hand, have the disadvantage that the relationship between estimated parameters and the reflectance/transmission spectra is unclear. In this article, a hybrid between a supervised learning method and physical modeling for the estimation of leaf parameters is proposed. In this method, a machine learning regression technique is applied to learn a mapping from the true hyperspectral data set to a data set that follows the PROSPECT model. The PROSPECT model then reveals the actual leaf parameters. Two mapping methods, based on Gaussian processes (GPs) and kernel ridge regression (KRR) are proposed. As an alternative, mapping onto the leaf absorption spectra is proposed as well. The proposed methodology not only estimates the leaf parameters with a lower error but also solves the interpretation problem of the parameters estimated by the advanced machine learning regression techniques. This method is validated on the ANGERS and LOPEX data set.

TI  - A residual network framework based on weighted feature channels for multispectral image compression
T2  - AD HOC NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, such as recognition, image enhancement and image compression. However, it is difficult to use a residual network that can efficiently consider the characteristics of multispectral images for multispectral image compression. In this paper, a novel end-to-end multispectral image compression framework based on a weighted feature channel residual network is proposed to efficiently remove the spatial and spectral redundancy of multispectral images by extracting the importance of each channel. The multispectral image compression framework includes a forward coding network, a rate-distortion optimizer, a quantizer/inverse quantizer, an entropy encoder/decoder and an inverse decoding network. In the encoder, multispectral images are directly fed into the forward coding network, and the main spectral and spatial features of the multispectral images are extracted by the residual block. Additionally, the weighted feature channel module can explicitly model the relationship between feature channels when extracting features from multispectral images and adaptively allocate different weights for each feature channel through training. The rate-distortion optimizer is added to make the main features compact. Then, the intermediate feature data are quantized and encoded by lossless entropy coding to obtain a code stream. In the decoder, the code stream is approximately restored to the intermediate features through the entropy decoder and the inverse quantizer. Then, the intermediate features are reconstructed to the multispectral images by the inverse decoding network. Experimental results on 7-band multispectral images of the Landsat 8 satellite and 8-band multispectral images of WorldView-3 satellite demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better PSNR than conventional 2D schemes (which are JPEG20 0 0 and JPEG in this paper) and 3D scheme (which is 3D-SPIHT in this paper) and can effectively preserve more spectral information of multispectral images.

TI  - A Search for a Theology of Life The Challenge of COVID-19 for Orthodox Ecclesiology and Religious Practices
T2  - ECUMENICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic offers the opportunity for theological meditation on several themes: life, death, illness, loneliness, fear, human relations, suffering, and social responsibility. This article addresses these themes only briefly, aiming not to build a systematic theological reflection but to share honest thoughts and concerns. Perhaps in our postmodern times we need, not so much theological certainties, but a theology that accompanies human life. Life and death are the only certainties, regardless of our worldview, perceptions, and theological convictions. The current global crisis has illuminated our shortcomings, failures, and disbeliefs on different levels. As Christians, we are united today also around our weakness, grief, and the loss of "normality." We are challenged, together with the rest of humanity. Could this be a God-given opportunity for renewal in our theology and church life?

TI  - Evidence and Considerations on Treatment of Small Size Merkel Cell Head and Neck Carcinoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine malignant cancer. It is an epidermal cancer common in the head and neck.Objectives Though there is limited number of cases described in the literature for the treatment difficult to obtain. Our purpose was to present the clinical course and treatment of four patients with MCC.Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis and obtained detailed clinical information for all 4 patients treated for MCC at the ENT Department of the SS Annunziata Hospital in Chieti, Italy, from 2013 through 2015.Results In our study, two patients presented with the tumor in a rare site (lower eyelid). All of the patients underwent surgical treatment: three patients had free excision margins and negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) while 1 patient had free excision margins and positive SLNs. The latter patient underwent ipsilateral neck dissection. In another patient, the fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission topography (FDG PET)/computed tomography (CT) performed 6 months after the surgery has shown highmetabolic activity in the left parotid gland, and the patient underwent total parotidectomy and a neck dissection.Conclusion Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a useful technique in small size MCCs of the head and neck. However, the parotid gland should be strictly controlled in patients with lower eyelid tumors.

TI  - Modeling of Forest Communities' Spatial Structure at the Regional Level through Remote Sensing and Field Sampling: Constraints and Solutions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study tests modern approaches to spatial modeling of forest communities at the regional level based on a supervised classification. The study is conducted by the example of mapping the composition of forest communities in a large urbanized region (the Moscow Region, area 4.69 million hectares). A database of 1684 field descriptions is used as sample plots. As environmental variables, Landsat spectral reflectances, vegetation indices (5 images), digital elevation model and morphometric parameters of the relief, 54 layers in total, are used. Additionally, the Palsar-2 radar dataset is included. The main mapped units are formations and groups of associations identified on the basis of the ecological-phytocoenotic classification. Formations and groups of associations are similar in semantics and principles of allocation to units of forest typology. It is shown that the maximum entropy method has a wide range of applications, in particular, for mapping the typological diversity of forest cover. The method is used in combination with geographically structured spatial jack-knifing, spatial rarefication of occurrence data and independent testing of model feature classes and regularization parameters. Spatial rarefication is a critical technique when points are not evenly distributed in space. The resulting model of the spatial structure of forest cover is based on the integration of the best models of each thematic class of different types of forest cover into a single cartographic layer. It is shown that under conditions of uneven and sparse distribution of points, it is possible to provide an average point matching level of 0.45 for formations and 0.29 for association groups. Herewith, the spatial structure and the ratio of the formation's composition correspond to the official data of the forest inventory. An attempt is made to identify and evaluate the distribution of more detailed syntaxonomic units: association groups. The necessary requirements for improving the quality of the forest cover model of the study area for 2 hierarchical typological units of forest cover are formulated. These include the additional sampling in order to equalize their spatial density, as well as to achieve equality of samples based on stratification according to the resulting map.

TI  - Characterizing spring phenology of temperate broadleaf forests using Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology has a great impact on land-atmosphere interactions like carbon cycling, albedo, and water and energy exchanges. To understand and predict these critical land-atmosphere feedbacks, it is crucial to measure and quantify phenological responses to climate variability, and ultimately climate change. Coarse-resolution sensors such as MODIS and AVHRR have been useful to study vegetation phenology from regional to global scales. These sensors are, however, not capable of discerning phenological variation at moderate spatial scales. By offering increased observation density and higher spatial resolution, the combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series might provide the opportunity to overcome this limitation.In this study, we analyzed the potential of combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat time series for estimating start of season (SOS) of broadleaf forests across Germany for the year 2018. We tested two common statistical modeling approaches (logistic and generalized additive models using thin plate splines) and the two most commonly used vegetation indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).We found strong agreement between SOS estimates from logistic and spline models (r(EVI) = 0.86; r(NDVI) = 0.65), whereas agreement was higher for EVI than for NDVI (RMSDEVI = 3.07, RMSDNDVI = 5.26 days). The choice of vegetation index thus had a higher impact on the results than the fitting method. The EVI-based SOS also showed higher correlation with ground observations compared to NDVI (r(EVI) = 0.51, r(NDVI) = 0.42). Data density played an important role in estimating land surface phenology. Models combining Sentinel-2A/B, with an average cloud-free observation frequency of 12 days, were largely consistent with the combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 models, suggesting that Sentinel-2A/B may be sufficient to capture SOS for most areas in Germany in 2018. However, in non-overlapping swath areas and mountain areas, observation frequency was significantly lower, underlining the need to combine Landsat and Sentinel-2 for consistent SOS estimates over large areas. Our study demonstrates that estimating SOS of temperate broadleaf forests at medium spatial resolution has become feasible with combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series.

TI  - Patterns of Failure in Women Who Have Residual Nodal Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer According to Extent of Lymph Node Surgery
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed patterns of failure of 70 patients with 1 to 3 involved nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer based on type of axillary surgery (sentinel lymph node biopsy alone vs. completion axillary dissection). We did not find differences in patterns of recurrence between the 2 groups.Background: Optimal surgical management of limited axillary nodal disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer is evolving. Concerns exist with respect to leaving residual disease in the axilla when omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in this setting. We sought to determine whether extent of nodal surgery altered patterns of failure and patient outcomes. Patients and Methods: We identified 70 patients with breast cancer who were confirmed cNO after NAC yet had residual nodal disease (ypN1) on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Twenty-eight patients underwent SLNB alone and 42 underwent SLNB completion (c)ALND in a non-randomized fashion. Most (n = 65) patients underwent adjuvant regional nodal irradiation (RNI). Detailed patterns of failure data were obtained for each patient. Results: The median follow-up was 43.5 months. There were 30 (43%) recurrences. Of these, 5 were isolated locoregional failures, and 24 were distant failures. There were no significant differences in local (P = .13), regional (P = .62), or distant (P = .47) failure between patients who underwent SLNB alone versus SLNB = cALND. Seventeen (24%) patients died. Overall survival was similar in both groups with median overall survival not reached for those who underwent SLNB and 109 months for those who underwent SLNB + cALND (P = .45). Conclusions: There were no differences in patterns of recurrence among patients with 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes after NAC who underwent SLNB alone versus SLNB + cALND in the setting of RNI. We await the results of ongoing, prospective clinical trials to confirm the relative merits of RNI in lieu of cALND in these patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - "Siberian Literary Memories" of Nikolai Yadrintsev: Genre Memory and Identity Construction
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The literary memories of Nikolai Yadrintsev are considered in the aspect of the self-narrative memoir tradition (primarily associated with the names of Ivan Turgenev, Pavel Annenkov and commoners generations), genre typology (features of the Bildungsroman and the career novel are highlighted (in the "Illusions perdues" version), and individual and social mythology The observations made allow stating that, in the text of the memories, the identity was constructed according to cultural patterns, assuming the modification of both the existing literary history and the created social history. Yadrintsev's literary heritage has been repeatedly investigated by historians and culturologists, but, until recently, mainly in the framework of the Siberian theme and the formation of a separate regional idea. Studies of recent years, revealing elements of the author's myth-making and his life-building project in Yadrintsev's texts, significantly expand the range of initial interpretations. The article considers Yadrintsev's text as part of the self-descriptive tradition. As well known, fictional and nonfictional literary memories, traditionally oriented towards the Bildungsroman and the career novel, determined the formation of established plots of memory, i.e. repeated and varied narrative elements that mark the main stages of his entry into the literary environment and his subsequent establishment in it. The "outcasts" "separated" from the metropolis-Siberian regionalists-turned to self-description in order not only to revise the "big" journal and scholarly literature, but also, by including their names, to present it with a largely mythologized alternative. The reprint of Yadrintsev's works in 1919 by the publishing house of Krasnoyarsk separatists contributed to the crystallization of the territorial and cultural identity, securing the status of a literary fact for the myth. Firstly, the renaming of the text changed the identity markers (the writer was a Siberian provincial) and influenced the configuration of events and their axiological status (all stories, mainly from the capital, received a Siberian attribution and were perceived exclusively in the Siberian context). Secondly, the segmentation of memories caused by the newspaper and book environment was arbitrarily eliminated, and fragmentary texts were graphically united in a book. The life-building intention, utterly exposed in this fragment (by mnemonic connections with the lyric-epic patterns of Gogol's and Turgenev's texts), extends not only to Letters, but also becomes one of the most transparent self-comments to Yadrintsev's memories: Siberia appears not only and not so much as a geographical space, but as a worldview and the highest value, and Letters about the Motherland are a symbol of a new first-time-asserted faith.

TI  - Assessing the optimal preprocessing steps of MODIS time series to map cropping systems in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of new cropping practices such as integrated Crop-Livestock systems (iCL) aims at improving the land use sustainability of the agricultural sector in the Brazilian Amazon. The emergence of such integrated systems, based on crop and pasture rotations over and within years, challenges the remote sensing community who needs to implement accurate and efficient methods to process satellite image time series (SITS) in order to come up with a monitoring protocol. These methods generally include a SITS preprocessing step which can be time consuming. The aim of this study is to assess the importance of preprocessing operations such as temporal smoothing and computation of phenological metrics on the mapping of main cropping systems (i.e. pasture, single cropping, double cropping and iCL), with a special emphasis on the iCL class. The study area is located in the state of Mato Grosso, an important producer of agriculture commodities located in the Southern Brazilian Amazon. SITS were composed of a set of 16-day composites of MODIS Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1 product) covering a one year period between 2014 and 2015. Two widely used classifiers, i.e. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were tested using five data sets issued from a same SITS but with different preprocessing levels: (i) raw NDVI; (ii) raw NDVI + raw EVI; (iii) smoothed NDVI; (iv) NDVI-derived phenometrics; (v) raw NDVI + phenometrics. Both RF and SVM classification results showed that the "raw NDVI + raw EVI" data set achieved the highest performance (RF OA = 0.96, RF Kappa = 0.94, SVM OA = 0.95, SVM Kappa = 0.93), followed closely by the "raw NDVI" and the "raw NDVI + phenometrics" datasets. The "NDVI-derived phenometrics" alone achieved the lowest accuracies (RF OA = 0.58 and SVM OA = 0.66). Considering that the implementation of preprocessing steps is computationally expensive and does not provide significant gains in terms of classification accuracy, we recommend to use raw vegetation indices for mapping cropping practices in Mato Grosso, including the integrated Crop-Livestock systems.

TI  - Satellite and airborne remote sensing of gross primary productivity in boreal Alaskan lakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In terrestrial and marine ecosystems, remote sensing has been used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) for decades, but few applications exist for shallow freshwater ecosystems.Here we show field-based GPP correlates with satellite and airborne lake color across a range of optically and limnologically diverse lakes in interior Alaska. A strong relationship betweenin situGPP derived from stable oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) and space-based lake color from satellites (e.g. Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and CubeSats) and airborne imagery (AVIRIS-NG) demonstrates the potential power of this technique for improving spatial and temporal monitoring of lake GPP when coupled with additional field validation measurements across different systems. In shallow waters clear enough for sunlight to reach lake bottoms, both submerged vegetation (macrophytes and algae) and phytoplankton likely contribute to GPP. The stable isotopes and remotely sensed shallow lake color used here integrate both components. These results demonstrate the utility of lake color as a feasible means for mapping lake GPP from remote sensing. This novel methodology estimates GPP from remote sensing in shallow lakes by combining field measurements of oxygen isotopes with airborne, satellite and CubeSat imagery. This use of lake color for providing insight into ecological processes of shallow lakes is recommended, especially for remote arctic and boreal landscapes.

TI  - High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperatures Derived from Landsat 8: A Study of Submesoscale Frontal Structures on the Pacific Shelf off the Hokkaido Coast, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal and offshore waters are generally separated by a barrier or "ocean front" on the continental shelf. A basic question arises as to what the representative spatial scale across the front may be. To answer this question, we simply corrected skin sea surface temperatures (SSTs) estimated from Landsat 8 imagery with a resolution of 100 m using skin SSTs estimated from geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari 8 with a resolution of 2 km. We analyzed snapshot images of skin SSTs on 13 October 2016, when we performed a simultaneous ship survey. We focused in particular on submesoscale thermal fronts on the Pacific shelf off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan. The overall spatial distribution of skin SSTs was consistent between Landsat 8 and Himawari 8; however, the spatial distribution of horizontal gradients of skin SSTs differed greatly between the two datasets. Some parts of strong fronts on the order of 1 degrees C km(-1) were underestimated with Himawari 8, mainly because of low resolution, whereas weak fronts on the order of 0.1 degrees C km(-1) were obscured in the Landsat 8 imagery because the signal-to-noise ratios were low. The widths of the strong fronts were estimated to be 114-461 m via Landsat 8 imagery and 539-1050 m via in situ ship survey. The difference was probably attributable to the difference in measurement depth of the SST, i.e., about 10-mu m skin layer by satellite and a few dozen centimeters below the sea surface by the in situ survey. Our results indicated that an ocean model with a grid size of no more than <= 100-200 m is essential for realistic simulation of the frontal structure on the shelf.

The input information consists of daily satellite estimates of Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) generated in a regular grid using a low uncertainty empirical satellite-based model which was specifically adapted for the region. Clusters are derived from the climatological annual cycle of monthly irradiation and clearness index and, separately, from time-series of monthly variability. The solar irradiation variability in each cluster is compared with El Nino South Oscillation (ENSO) signal. A high negative correlation is observed between ENSO and solar irradiance, most predominantly over February to May and November to December, particularly for the latter. This means that in a strong El Nino/La Nina year, solar irradiation values for the November-December period in Uruguay will be smaller/higher than the climatological average. These results are in agreement with the ones obtained for rainfall in other studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - In-Situ and Aircraft Reflectance Measurement Effectiveness for CAL/VAL Activities: A Study over Railroad Valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to assess the relationship between the surface reflectance derived from ground based and aircraft measurements. The parameters of the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) and Ross Thick-LiSparse (RTLS) kernel based bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF), have been derived using actual measurements of the hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF), collected during different campaigns over the Railroad Valley Playa. The effect of the atmosphere, including that of the diffuse radiation on bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) parameter retrievals, assessed using 6S model simulations, was negligible for the low turbidity conditions of the site under investigation (tau 550 <= 0.05). It was also shown that the effects of the diffuse radiation on RPV spectral parameters retrieval is linear for the isotropic parameter rho 0 and the scattering parameter Theta, and can be described with a second order polynomial for the k-Minnaert parameter. In order to overcome the lack of temporal collocations between aircraft and in-situ measurements, Monte Carlo 3-D radiative transfer simulations mimicking in-situ and remote sensing techniques were performed on a synthetic parametric meshed scene defined by merging Landsat and Multianglhe Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) remote sensing reflectance data. We simulated directional reflectance measurements made at different heights for PARABOLA and CAR, and analyzed them according to practices adopted for real measurements, consisting of the inversion of BRF functions and the calculation of the bi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR). The difference of retrievals against the known benchmarks of kernel parameters and BHR is presented. We associated an uncertainty of up to 2% with the retrieval of area averaged BHR, independently of flight altitudes and the BRF model used for the inversion. As expected, the local nature of PARABOLA data is revealed by the difference of the anisotropic kernel parameters with the corresponding parameters retrieved from aircraft loops. The uncertainty of the resultant BHR fell within +/- 3%.

TI  - Convergence of urban forest and socio-economic indicators of resilience: A study of environmental inequality in four major cities in eastern Canada
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental inequality is a phenomenon drawing much attention in the scientific and policy-making debates about urban forests and city greening. Most studies on the subject have shown that socially vulnerable, multicultural neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the lack of urban forest while richer neighborhoods tend to be greener. But are there differences in the resilience of urban forests between poor and rich neighborhoods? We tackled this question using a newly developed indicator of urban forest resilience, functional diversity, to determine if environmental injustice is also found in the resilience of urban forests in poor neighborhoods. Using Canadian census data at the census tract scale, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and urban tree inventories, this study investigated if urban forest resilience is also part of the environmental inequality phenomenon in four urban areas in eastern Canada: Toronto, Gatineau-Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City. Multivariate analysis of the dataset shows that urban forest functional diversity, used as an indicator of resilience, is inversely correlated to a set of variables associated with social vulnerability. The same relationship also exists with canopy cover; a pattern of inequality found in many cities around the world. With these findings, we show that social vulnerability and urban forest resilience are intertwined, meaning that neighborhoods already lacking urban forest are also more at risk of losing it due to a sudden environmental disturbance. When confronted with global change, considering this new insight into urban environmental inequality could be of great importance for maintaining a comfortable living environment for every city-dweller.

TI  - A Narrative Review of Methods for Causal Inference and Associated Educational Resources
T2  - QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives: Root cause analysis involves evaluation of causal relationships between exposures (or interventions) and adverse outcomes, such as identification of direct (eg, medication orders missed) and root causes (eg, clinician's fatigue and workload) of adverse rare events. To assess causality requires either randomization or sophisticated methods applied to carefully designed observational studies. In most cases, randomized trials are not feasible in the context of root cause analysis. Using observational data for causal inference, however, presents many challenges in both the design and analysis stages. Methods for observational causal inference often fall outside the toolbox of even well-trained statisticians, thus necessitating workforce training. Methods: This article synthesizes the key concepts and statistical perspectives for causal inference, and describes available educational resources, with a focus on observational clinical data. The target audience for this review is clinical researchers with training in fundamental statistics or epidemiology, and statisticians collaborating with those researchers. Results: The available literature includes a number of textbooks and thousands of review articles. However, using this literature for independent study or clinical training programs is extremely challenging for numerous reasons. First, the published articles often assume an advanced technical background with different notations and terminology. Second, they may be written from any number of perspectives across statistics, epidemiology, computer science, or philosophy. Third, the methods are rapidly expanding and thus difficult to capture within traditional publications. Fourth, even the most fundamental aspects of causal inference (eg, framing the causal question as a target trial) often receive little or no coverage. This review presents an overview of (1) key concepts and frameworks for causal inference and (2) online documents that are publicly available for better assisting researchers to gain the necessary perspectives for functioning effectively within a multidisciplinary team. Conclusion: A familiarity with causal inference methods can help risk managers empirically verify, from observed events, the true causes of adverse sentinel events.

TI  - Land cover and climate changes drive regionally heterogeneous increases in US insecticide use
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Global environmental change is expected to dramatically affect agricultural crop production through a myriad of pathways. One important and thus far poorly understood impact is the effect of land cover and climate change on agricultural insect pests and insecticides. Objectives Here we address the following three questions: (1) how do landscape complexity and weather influence present-day insecticide use, (2) how will changing landscape characteristics and changing climate influence future insecticide use, and how do these effects manifest for different climate and land cover projections? and (3) what are the most important drivers of changing insecticide use?Methods We use panel models applied to county-level agriculture, land cover, and weather data in the US to understand how landscape composition and configuration, weather, and farm characteristics impact present-day insecticide use. We then leverage forecasted changes in land cover and climate under different future scenarios to predict insecticide use in 2050.Results We find different future scenarios-through modifications in both landscape and climate conditions-increase the amount of area treated by similar to 4-20% relative to 2017, with regionally heterogeneous impacts. Of note, we report large farms are more influential than large crop patches and increased winter minimum temperature is more influential than increased summer maximum temperature. However, our results suggest the most important determinants of future insecticide use are crop composition and farm size, variables for which future forecasts are sparse.Conclusions Both landscape and climate change are expected to increase future insecticide use. Yet, crop composition and farm size are highly influential, data-poor variables. Better understanding of future crop composition and farm economics is necessary to effectively predict and mitigate increases in pesticide use.

TI  - Species dominance and above ground biomass in the Bialowieza Forest, Poland, described by airborne hyperspectral and lidar data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to test and evaluate hyperspectral and lidar data to derive information on tree species dominance and above ground biomass in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland. This forest is threatened by climate change, fire, bark beetles attacks, and logging, with changes in species composition and dominance. In this conservation valuable area, the monitoring of forest resources is thus critical.Results indicate that vegetation indices from hyperspectral data can support species dominance detection: using a Classification and Regression Trees algorithm the three main plot types (dominated by Deciduous, Spruce, and Pines species) were classified with an Overall Accuracy > 0.9. The accuracy decreased when a 'Mixed' group was added to account for very heterogeneous plots, and plots dominated by Spruce were not correctly detected. Hyperspectral vegetation indices were also used to estimate the level of species dominance in the forest plots, using a Multivariate Multiple Linear Regression model; the obtained accuracy varied according to groups, being higher for Deciduous (R-2 = 0.87), compared to Pines (R-2 = 0.61), and to Spruce-dominated plots (R-2 = 0.37).Lidar data were employed to estimate above ground biomass, using an exponential regression model; overall the R-2 resulted equal to 0.66 but ranged from 0.57 to 0.78 when considering subgroups according to species dominance; the addition of hyperspectral vegetation indices improved the result only for Pines.The illustrated methods provide a reliable description of important forest characteristics and simplify resource monitoring, supporting local authorities to address the challenges imposed by climate change and other forest threats.

TI  - Nodal staging affects adjuvant treatment choices in elderly patients with clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In response to Choosing Wisely recommendations that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should not be routinely performed in elderly patients with node-negative (cN0), estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, we sought to evaluate how nodal staging affects adjuvant treatment in this population.Methods From a prospective database, we identified patients 70 or more years of age with cNO breast cancer treated with surgery for ER+ HER2-negative invasive disease during 2012-2016. We determined rates of, and factors associated with, nodal positivity (pN+), and compared the use of adjuvant radiation (RT) and systemic therapy by nodal status.Results Of 364 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 331 (91%) underwent SLNB, with 75 (23%) being pN+. Axillary node dissection was performed in 11 patients (3%). On multivariate analysis, tumour size was the only factor associated with pN+ (p = 0.007). Nodal positivity rates were 0%, 13%, 23%, 33%, and 27% for lesions preoperatively sized at 0-0.5 cm, 0.5-1 cm, 1.1-2.0 cm, 2.1-5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm. Compared with patients assessed as node-negative, those who were pN+ were more likely to receive axillary RT (lumpectomy: 53% vs. 1%, p < 0.001; mastectomy: 43% vs. 2%, p < 0.001), and adjuvant systemic therapy (endocrine: 82% vs. 69%; chemotherapy plus endocrine: 7% vs. 2%, p = 0.002).Conclusions Of elderly patients with cNO ER+ breast cancer, 23% were pN+ on SLNB. Size was the primary predictor of nodal status, and yet significant rates of nodal positivity were observed even in tumours preoperatively sized at 1 cm or less. The use of RT and systemic adjuvant therapies differed by nodal status, although the long-term oncologic implications require further investigation. Multidisciplinary input on a case-by-case basis should be considered before omission of SLNB.

TI  - Application of Satellite Imagery and Water Indices to the Hydrography of the Cetina RiverBasin (Middle Adriatic)
T2  - TRANSACTIONS ON MARITIME SCIENCE-TOMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper gives a brief description of the remote sensing method used for the identification and extraction of water surfaces. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery was used to separate land from bodies of water in the complex karst area surrounding the Croatian Cetina River, flowing into the Adriatic Sea. Water indexing methods are presented in detail. The most frequently used water indices were selected: NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI_nsh, AWEI_sh, WRI and LSWI, and their results compared. The combination of satellite imagery and calculated water indices is concluded to be very useful for the identification and mapping of the area and banks of lakes, riverine zones, river mouths and the coastline in the coastal zone. Landsat 8 satellite imagery is slightly inferior to Sentinel 2 due to lower image resolution. The best results were obtained with the NDWI water index and the worst with LSWI.

TI  - A Study for Estimation of High Resolution Temperature Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning Models during Heat Waves
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the feasibility of three algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN), for estimating the air temperature of an unobserved area where the weather station is not installed. The satellite image were obtained from Landsat-8 and MODIS Aqua/Terra acquired in 2019, and the meteorological ground weather data were from AWS/ASOS data of Korea Meteorological Administration and Korea Forest Service. In addition, in order to improve the estimation accuracy, a digital surface model, solar radiation, aspect and slope were used. The accuracy assessment of machine learning methods was performed by calculating the statistics of R-2 (determination coefficient) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) through 10-fold cross-validation and the estimated values were compared for each target area. As a result, the neural network algorithm showed the most stable result among the three algorithms with R-2 = 0.805 and RMSE = 0.508. The neural network algorithm was applied to each data set on Landsat imagery scene. It was possible to generate an mean air temperature map from June to September 2019 and confirmed that detailed air temperature information could be estimated. The result is expected to be utilized for national disaster safety management such as heat wave response policies and heat island mitigation research.

TI  - Linkage between residential green spaces and allergic rhinitis among Asian children (case study: Taiwan)
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) continues to increase, and the greatest increases were observed mostly in non-Western regions, particularly Asian and Pacific regions; however, only a few studies have been conducted in Asia.Objectives: Using Taiwan as an example of a typical Asian country, this study aimed to evaluate the association between green areas and the frequency of clinical visits for AR among children in Asia.Methods: We used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database to identify subjects diagnosed with AR at four years old in 2003, who were then followed up with until 2011. Greenness exposure was assessed using the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) was applied to examine the association between green areas and the rate of AR after controlling for confounders.Results: The major results indicate a positive correlation, as green areas significantly increased the risk of AR by up to 8.4%. Further, sensitivity test analyses confirmed the robustness of the model estimates, even after adjusting for confounders. Stratified analysis results also display areas with high humidity and low temperatures increasing the risk of AR by up to 14% and 27%, respectively. In contrast, areas with low humidity and high temperatures decreased the risk of AR by up to 4% and 22%, respectively. Moreover, the positive relationship between greenness and AR among children was consistent across different sub-populations.Conclusions: Greenness exposure contributes to an increased risk of allergic rhinitis (AR). This finding could serve as a reference for designing green landscapes, especially in residential areas.

TI  - Typhoon-Triggered Phytoplankton Bloom and Associated Upper-Ocean Conditions in the Northwestern Pacific: Evidence from Satellite Remote Sensing, Argo Profile, and an Ocean Circulation Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-lasting phytoplankton bloom, characterized by high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in an eddy-like feature, was detected in MODIS satellite imagery of the northwestern Pacific following the passage of Typhoon Krosa in August 2019. Satellite datasets, Argo measurements, and regional ocean models were analyzed to determine the occurrence and abundance of high-Chl-a concentrations and the upper-ocean conditions associated with them before and after the passage of the typhoon. Remote sensing data revealed that the typhoon triggered sharp increases in surface Chl-a concentrations more than five times the pre-typhoon average, which lasted for two weeks. The elevated post-typhoon concentrations coincided with a pre-existing oceanic cyclone that was detected as an altimetry-based sea surface height anomaly. The typhoon looped around the oceanic cyclone and lingered for two days at slow speeds (less than 2 m/s), producing an unusual sea-surface cooling of up to approximately 9 degrees C in the cyclonic eddy region. Our model successfully captured the typhoon-induced cold-core cyclonic circulation, which corresponded to the region of high Chl-a concentration. Model-data comparisons revealed that the looping motion of the slow-moving typhoon enhanced the pre-existing cyclonic circulation, resulting in strong vertical mixing and upwelling, consequently initiating a phytoplankton bloom due to increased nutrient supply to the euphotic zone.

TI  - Multi-task Learning Based Tropical Cyclone Intensity Monitoring and Forecasting through Fusion of Geostationary Satellite Data and Numerical Forecasting Model Output
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring and forecasting of the intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs) are able to effectively reduce the overall costs of disaster management. In this study, we proposed a multi-task learning (MTL) based deep learning model for real-time TC intensity estimation and forecasting with the lead time of 6-12 hours following the event, based on the fusion of geostationary satellite images and numerical forecast model output. A total of 142 TCs which developed in the Northwest Pacific from 2011 to 2016 were used in this study. The Communications system, the Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) data were used to extract the images of typhoons, and the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) provided by the National Center of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) was employed to extract air and ocean forecasting data. This study suggested two schemes with different input variables to the MTL models. Scheme 1 used only satellite-based input data while scheme 2 used both satellite images and numerical forecast modeling. As a result of real-time TC intensity estimation, Both schemes exhibited similar performance. For TC intensity forecasting with the lead time of 6 and 12 hours, scheme 2 improved the performance by 13% and 16%, respectively, in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) when compared to scheme 1. Relative root mean squared errors (rRMSE) for most intensity levels were less than 30%. The lower mean absolute error (MAE) and RMSE were found for the lower intensity levels of TCs. In the test results of the typhoon HALONG in 2014, scheme 1 tended to overestimate the intensity by about 20 kts at the early development stage. Scheme 2 slightly reduced the error, resulting in an overestimation by about 5 kts. The MTL models reduced the computational cost about 300% when compared to the single-tasking model, which suggested the feasibility of the rapid production of TC intensity forecasts.

TI  - Evaluation of the Utility of SSG Algorithm for Image Restoration of Landsat-8
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellites are representative optical satellites that have observed the Earth's surface for a long-term, and are suitable for long-term changes such as disaster preparedness/recovery monitoring, land use change, change detection, and time series monitoring. In this paper, clouds and cloud shadows were detected using QA bands to detect and remove clouds simply and efficiently. Then, the missing area of the experimantal image is restorated through the SSG algorithm, which does not directly refer to the pixel value of the reference image, but performs restoration to the pixel value in the Experimental image. Through this study, we presented the possibility of utilizing the modified SSG algorithm by quantitatively and qualitatively evaluating information on various land cover conditions in the thermal wavelength band as well as the visible wavelength band observing the surface.

TI  - Sentinel-1 additive noise removal from cross-polarization extra-wide TOPSAR with dynamic least-squares
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platform with an operational mode called extra wide (EW) that offers large regions of ocean areas to be observed. A major issue with EW images is that the cross-polarized HV and VH channels have prominent additive noise patterns relative to low backscatter intensity, which disrupts tasks that require manual or automated interpretation. The European Space Agency (ESA) provides a method for removing the additive noise pattern by means of lookup tables, but applying them directly produces unsatisfactory results because characteristics of the noise still remain. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the magnitude of the additive noise dynamically depends on factors that are not considered by the ESA estimated noise field.To address these issues we propose a quadratic objective function to model the mis-scale of the provided noise field on an image. We consider a linear denoising model that re-scales the noise field for each subswath, whose parameters are found from a least-squares solution over the objective function. This method greatly reduces the presence of additive noise while not requiring a set of training images, is robust to heterogeneity in images, dynamically estimates parameters for each image, and finds parameters using a closed-form solution.Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The first experiment simulated noise removal on a set of RADARSAT-2 images with noise fields artificially imposed on them. The second experiment conducted noise removal on a set of Sentinel-1 images taken over the five oceans. Afterwards, quality of the noise removal was evaluated based on the appearance of open-water. The two experiments indicate that the proposed method marks an improvement both visually and through numerical measures.

TI  - Classification of Landscape Affected by Deforestation Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data and Deep-Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced deforestation has a major impact on forest ecosystems and therefore its detection and analysis methods should be improved. This study classified landscape affected by human-induced deforestation efficiently using high-resolution remote sensing and deep-learning. The SegNet and U-Net algorithms were selected for application with high-resolution remote sensing data obtained by the Kompsat-3 satellite. Land and forest cover maps were used as base data to construct accurate deep-learning datasets of deforested areas at high spatial resolution, and digital maps and a softwood database were used as reference data. Sites were classified into forest and non-forest areas, and a total of 13 areas (2 forest and 11 non-forest) were selected for analysis. Overall, U-Net was more accurate than SegNet (74.8% vs. 63.3%). The U-Net algorithm was about 11.5% more accurate than the SegNet algorithm, although SegNet performed better for the hardwood and bare land classes. The SegNet algorithm misclassified many forest areas, but no non-forest area. There was reduced accuracy of the U-Net algorithm due to misclassification among sub-items, but U-Net performed very well at the forest/non-forest area classification level, with 98.4% accuracy for forest areas and 88.5% for non-forest areas. Thus, deep-learning modeling has great potential for estimating human-induced deforestation in mountain areas. The findings of this study will contribute to more efficient monitoring of damaged mountain forests and the determination of policy priorities for mountain area restoration.

TI  - Seagrass cover expansion off Caja de Muertos Island, Puerto Rico, as determined by long-term analysis of historical aerial and satellite images (1950-2014)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass ecosystems affected by climate change and anthropogenic disturbances require baseline characteriza-tion of their cover, distribution, and dynamics for effective conservation strategies. Caja de Muertos Island (CMI) is an important nature reserve in Puerto Rico where long-term trends in seagrass cover are unknown but where availability of historical aerial photographs can provide elements for analyzing seagrass dynamics. The purpose of this study was to understand those dynamics in CMI, thereby providing a baseline for determining the severity of future disturbances and inform conservation strategies. We quantified changes in seagrass spatial extent using object-based image analysis in a 2014 WorldView-2 image and historical aerial photographs from 1950 to 2010. Contrasting with worldwide seagrass declining trends, seagrass extent in CMI showed a positive rate of ex-pansion and increased 64%, which was mainly explained by the patchy seagrass cover category that was also the most persistent cover throughout the 64-year period analyzed. Findings suggest an increase in seagrass extent due to recolonization of seagrasses after impacts of tropical storm Baker in 1950, aided by other factors such as reduction in grazing pressure. Even though seagrass cover expanded, with other tropical storms and hurricanes, no negative effects were observed except between 1993 and 1999. The amount and frequency of changes in seagrass cover categories varied between zones and seemed to be linked to localized environmental conditions (e.g. wave exposure) and geomorphological characteristics. The present study represents a baseline of seagrass cover distribution and dynamics, offering valuable information for conservation strategies in Caja de Muertos Island Nature Reserve. In the absence of in situ long-term monitoring data, this study also shows how aerial photography and an object-based image analysis are effective for assessing trends and quantifying seagrass cover changes in clear oligotrophic waters.

TI  - Detection and community-level identification of microbial mats in the McMurdo Dry Valleys using drone-based hyperspectral reflectance imaging
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflectance spectroscopic characteristics of cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) were measured using a hyperspectral point spectrometer aboard an unmanned aerial system (remotely piloted aircraft system, unmanned aerial vehicle or drone) to determine whether mat presence, type and activity could be mapped at a spatial scale sufficient to characterize inter-annual change. Mats near Howard Glacier and Canada Glacier (ASPA 131) were mapped and mat samples were collected for DNA-based microbiome analysis. Although a broadband spectral parameter (a partial normalized difference vegetation index) identified mats, it missed mats in comparatively deep (> 10 cm) water or on bouldery surfaces where mats occupied fringing moats. A hyperspectral parameter (B6) did not have these shortcomings and recorded a larger dynamic range at both sites. When linked with colour orthomosaic data, B6 band strength is shown to be capable of characterizing the presence, type and activity of cyanobacteria-dominated mats in and around MDV streams. 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction amplicon sequencing analysis of the mat samples revealed that dominant cyanobacterial taxa differed between spectrally distinguishable mats, indicating that spectral differences reflect underlying biological distinctiveness. Combined rapid-repeat hyperspectral measurements can be applied in order to monitor the distribution and activity of sentinel microbial ecosystems across the terrestrial Antarctic.

TI  - Short-term vegetation loss versus decadal degradation of grasslands in the Caucasus based on Cumulative Endmember Fractions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation affects over one-third of the global land area and is projected to become even more widespread due to climate change and land use pressures. Despite being a critical issue for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and food security, the detection of the onset, duration, and magnitude of land degradation remains challenging, as is early identification of short-term vegetation loss preceding land degradation. Here, we present a new approach for monitoring both short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands using satellite data. Our approach integrates Spectral Mixture Analysis and temporal segmentation, and analyzes dense time-series of satellite observations in three steps. First, we unmix all available satellite observations and aggregate them into monthly composites. Second, we calculate the annual Cumulative Endmember Fractions and examine their piecewise trends among years to determine the onset, duration, and magnitude of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation. Third, we attribute a decrease in the green vegetation fraction with a concomitant increase in either open soil, or non-photosynthetic vegetation. We tested our method mapping short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands in the Caucasus Ecoregion using the 2001-2018 time series of MODIS 8-day reflectance data. We found strong patterns of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation, mostly in the eastern part of the Caucasus Ecoregion in areas of desert and semi-desert natural vegetation. Short-term vegetation loss episodes (3-9 years) were more common and had greater magnitude than decadal degradation (>= 10 years), especially in steppe regions. On average, 9.3% of grassland area was subjected annually to either decadal, or short-term vegetation loss. Desiccation, i.e., the shift from green vegetation to dry vegetation, was the most prevalent type of change pathway, with green vegetation loss to open soil coming second. Decadal degradation and short-term vegetation loss rates were the highest in dry areas where the potential natural vegetation is sub-shrub deserts, or halophytic, alluvial, and wet lowland forests. Our findings support known general degradation patterns in the Caucasus Ecoregion, but provide better understanding of ongoing processes, by detecting exact location, timing, and magnitude of changes. More broadly, our method advances the monitoring of grasslands by detecting both decadal degradation and shortterm vegetation loss. This flexibility supports adaptive degradation monitoring, aids sustainable land management, and provides new information for carbon stock analyses and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Geometric Variation in the Surface Rupture of the 2018 Mw7.5 Palu Earthquake from Subpixel Optical Image Correlation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We obtained high-resolution (10 m) horizontal displacement fields from pre- and post-seismic Sentinel-2 optical images of the 2018 Mw7.5 Palu earthquake using subpixel image correlation. From these, we calculated the curl, divergence, and shear strain fields from the north-south (NS) and east-west (EW) displacement fields. Our results show that the surface rupture produced by the event was distributed within the Sulawesi neck (0.0974-0.6632 degrees S) and Palu basin (0.8835-1.4206 degrees S), and had a variable strike of 313.0-355.2 degrees and strike slip of 2.00-6.62 m. The NS and EW displacement fields within the Palu basin included fine-scale displacements in both the near- and far-fault, the deformation patterns included a small restraining bend (localized shortening), a distributed rupture zone, and a major releasing bend (net extension) from the curl, divergence, and shear strain. Surface rupture was dominated by left-lateral strike-slip from initiation to termination, with a localized normal slip component peaking at similar to 3.75 m. The characteristics and geometric variation of the ruptured fault controlled both the formation of these surface deformation patterns and sustained supershear rupture.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Vegetation Response to Mining Activities in Resource Regions of Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aggregated mining development has direct and indirect impacts on vegetation changes. This impact shows spatial differences due to the complex influence of multiple mines, which is a common issue in resource regions. To estimate the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation response to mining activities, we coupled vegetation changes and mining development through a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model for three cumulative periods between 1999 and 2018 in integrated resource regions of northwestern China. Vegetation changes were monitored by Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test according to a total of 72 Landsat images. Spatial distribution of mining development was quantified, due to four land-use maps in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2017. The results showed that 80% of vegetation in the study area experienced different degrees of degradation, more serious in the overlapping areas of multiple mines and mining areas. The scope of influence for single mines on vegetation shrunk by about 48%, and the mean coefficients increased by 20%, closer to mining areas. The scope of influence for multiple mines on vegetation gradually expanded to 86% from the outer edge to the inner overlapping areas of mining areas, where the mean coefficients increased by 92%. The correlation between elevation and vegetation changes varied according to the average elevation of the total mining areas. Ultimately, the available ecological remediation should be systematically considered for local conditions and mining consequences.

TI  - Drought prediction models driven by meteorological and remote sensing data in Guanzhong Area, China
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is an important factor that limits economic and social development due to its frequent occurrence and profound influence. Therefore, it is of great significance to make accurate predictions of drought for early warning and disaster alleviation. In this paper, SPEI-1 was confirmed to classify drought grades in the Guanzhong Area, and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) model were established. Meteorological data and remote sensing data were used to derive the prediction models. The results showed the following. (1) The SVM model performed the best when the models were developed using meteorological data, remote sensing data and a combination of meteorological and remote sensing data, but the model's corresponding kernel functions are different and include linear, polynomial and Gaussian radial basis kernel functions, respectively. (2) The RF model driven by the remote sensing data and the SVM model driven by the combined meteorological and remote sensing data were found to perform better than the model driven by the corresponding other data in the Guanzhong Area. It is difficult to accurately measure drought with the single meteorological data. Only by considering the combined factors can we more accurately monitor and predict drought. This study can provide an important scientific basis for regional drought warnings and predictions.

TI  - Identification of successional trajectory over 30 Years and evaluation of reclamation effect in coal waste dumps of surface coal mine
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological environment of the mining area has always been one of the focuses for its strong disturbance by human activities. The goals of this study were to ascertain the succession trajectory types of revegetation in the surface mining area and evaluate whether the revegetation in 3 coal-waste-dump sites with different reclamation methods were restored to the pre-disturbance status. We proposed an analysis method that combines machine learning method with traditional statistical analysis method by using the multi-temporal Landsat images and surveying data. The results showed that the trajectories of modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) of the south dump (D3) performed better than that of the north dump (D2) and the west dump (D1), which means the revegetation of D3 had reached or even exceeded its pre-mining level judging by those remote sensing indicators. In terms of bio-diversity, the reclamation effect of D3 had also improved significantly than other 2 dumps, especially in the Caragana microphylla planting area, while the species structure of the revegetation of D3 was also relatively simple and was susceptible to be disturbed. Besides, we also found that the contents of total nitrogen (TN), available potassium (AK) and soil organic matter (SOM) in the waste dumps were still lower than those of undisturbed grassland, at the same time soil properties content raised with the increase of planting density of Caragana microphylla. Study showed the time series remote sensing trajectory analysis and field investigation analysis were complementary to each other and can reflect the mining influence and reclamation effect in a more comprehensive and effective way, which could be applied to gain further insight concerning ecosystems and other essential environmental features in similar disturbed area.

TI  - Dual Path Attention Net for Remote Sensing Semantic Image Segmentation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation plays an important role in being able to understand the content of remote sensing images. In recent years, deep learning methods based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have proved to be effective for the sematic segmentation of remote sensing images. However, the rich information and complex content makes the training of networks for segmentation challenging, and the datasets are necessarily constrained. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model called Dual Path Attention Network (DPA-Net) that has a simple modular structure and can be added to any segmentation model to enhance its ability to learn features. Two types of attention module are appended to the segmentation model, one focusing on spatial information the other focusing upon the channel. Then, the outputs of these two attention modules are fused to further improve the network's ability to extract features, thus contributing to more precise segmentation results. Finally, data pre-processing and augmentation strategies are used to compensate for the small number of datasets and uneven distribution. The proposed network was tested on the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID). The results show that the network outperformed U-Net, PSP-Net, and DeepLab V3+ in terms of the mean IoU by 0.84%, 2.54%, and 1.32%, respectively.

TI  - TRC-Based High-Precision Spot Position Detection in Inter-Satellite Laser Communication
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-satellite laser communication (Is-OWC) is one of the main space optical communication technologies currently studied in various countries. In recent years, a kind of Is-OWC communication terminal without independent beacon light has appeared. Such terminals do not have a separate beacon laser with a large divergence angle, but use a narrower communication beam to complete space capture and tracking. Therefore, the energy of the light beam divided by the acquisition, tracking, and aiming (ATP) system is greatly reduced. How to perform high-precision spot position detection under extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a problem that must be faced. Aiming to resolve this problem, this article proposes to use a cosine signal to modulate the intensity of the signal light, so as to convert the problem of detecting a weak light signal into the problem of detecting a line spectrum signal. The authors used the time reversal convolution (TRC) algorithm with a window function to suppress noise and enhance the spectrum line, so as to accurately detect the amplitudes of the weak photocurrents. Finally, by calculating the ratio of the photocurrent amplitude values, the precise spot position is obtained. In the experiment, when the output SNR of the four-quadrant detector (QD) is as low as -17.86 dB, the proposed method can still detect the spot position and the absolute error is limited within 0.0238 mrad.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of forest canopy height using machine learning by coupling ICESat-2 LiDAR with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is an important indicator of forest carbon storage, productivity, and biodiversity. The present study showed the first attempt to develop a machine-learning workflow to map the spatial pattern of the forest canopy height in a mountainous region in the northeast China by coupling the recently available canopy height (H-canopy) footprint product from ICESat-2 with the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. The ICESat-2 H-canopy was initially validated by the high-resolution canopy height from airborne LiDAR data at different spatial scales. Performance comparisons were conducted between two machine-learning models - deep learning (DL) model and random forest (RF) model, and between the Sentinel and Landsat-8 satellites. Results showed that the ICESat-2 H-canopy showed the highest correlation with the airborne LiDAR canopy height at a spatial scale of 250 m with a Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.82 and a mean bias of -1.46 m, providing important evidence on the reliability of the ICESat-2 vegetation height product from the case in China's forest. Both DL and RF models obtained satisfactory accuracy on the upscaling of ICESat-2 H-canopy assisted by Sentinel satellite co-variables with an R-value between the observed and predicted H-canopy equalling 0.78 and 0.68, respectively. Compared to Sentinel satellites, Landsat-8 showed relatively weaker performance in H-canopy prediction, suggesting that the addition of the backscattering coefficients from Sentinel-1 and the red-edge related variables from Sentinel-2 could positively contribute to the prediction of forest canopy height. To our knowledge, few studies have demonstrated large-scale vegetation height mapping in a resolution <= 250 m based on the newly available satellites (ICESat-2, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) and DL regression model, particularly in the forest areas in China. Thus, the present work provided a timely and important supplementary to the applications of these new earth observation tools.

TI  - Retrieval of Sea Surface Wind Speed from Spaceborne SAR over the Arctic Marginal Ice Zone with a Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we presented a method for retrieving sea surface wind speed (SSWS) from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization data in extra-wide (EW) swath mode, which have been extensively acquired over the Arctic for polar monitoring. In contrast to the conventional algorithm, i.e., using a geophysical model function (GMF) to retrieve SSWS by spaceborne SAR, we introduced an alternative retrieval method based on a GMF-guided neural network. The SAR normalized radar cross section, incidence angle, and wind direction are used as the inputs of a back propagation (BP) neural network, and the output is the SSWS. The network is developed based on 11,431 HH-polarized EW images acquired in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Arctic from 2015 to 2018 and their collocated scatterometer wind measurements. Verification of the neural network based on the testing dataset yields a bias of 0.23 m/s and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.25 m/s compared to the scatterometer wind data for wind speeds less than approximately 30 m/s. Further comparison of the SAR retrieved SSWS with independent buoy measurements shows a bias and RMSE of 0.12 m/s and 1.42 m/s, respectively. We also analyzed the uncertainty of the retrieval when reanalysis model wind direction data are used as inputs to the neural network. By combining the detected sea ice cover information based on SAR data, sea ice and marine-meteorological parameters can be derived simultaneously by spaceborne SAR at a high spatial resolution in the Arctic.

TI  - Deep-learning-based information mining from ocean remote-sensing imagery
T2  - NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - With the continuous development of space and sensor technologies during the last 40 years, ocean remote sensing has entered into the big-data era with typical five-V (volume, variety, value, velocity and veracity) characteristics. Ocean remote-sensing data archives reach several tens of petabytes and massive satellite data are acquired worldwide daily. To precisely, efficiently and intelligently mine the useful information submerged in such ocean remote-sensing data sets is a big challenge. Deep learning-a powerful technology recently emerging in the machine-learning field-has demonstrated its more significant superiority over traditional physical- or statistical-based algorithms for image-information extraction in many industrial-field applications and starts to draw interest in ocean remote-sensing applications. In this review paper, we first systematically reviewed two deep-learning frameworks that carry out ocean remote-sensing-image classifications and then presented eight typical applications in ocean internal-wave/eddy/oil-spill/coastal-inundation/sea-ice/green-algae/ship/coral-reef mapping from different types of ocean remote-sensing imagery to show how effective these deep-learning frameworks are. Researchers can also readily modify these existing frameworks for information mining of other kinds of remote-sensing imagery.

TI  - Land Surface Albedo Variations in Sanjiang Plain from 1982 to 2015: Assessing with GLASS Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key parameter for indicating the fraction of surface-reflected solar incident radiation, land surface albedo plays an important role in the Earth's surface energy budget (SEB). Since the Sanjiang Plain has been severely affected by human activities (e.g., reclamation and shrinking of wetlands), it is important to assess the spatiotemporal variations of surface albedo in this region using a long-term remote sensing dataset. In order to investigate the surface albedo climatology, trends, and mechanisms of change, we evaluated the surface albedo variations in the Sanjiang Plain, China from 1982 to 2015 using the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) broadband surface albedo product. The results showed that: 1) an increasing annual trend (+0.000 58/yr) of surface albedo was discovered in the Sanjiang Plain based on the GLASS albedo dataset, with a much stronger increasing trend (+0.001 26/yr) occurring during the winter. Most of the increasing trends occurred over the cultivated land, unused land, and land use conversion types located in the northeastern Sanjiang Plain. 2) The increasing trend of land surface albedo in Sanjiang Plain can be largely explained by the changes of both snow cover extent and land use. The surface albedo in winter is highly correlated with the snow cover extent in the Sanjiang Plain, and the increasing trend of surface albedo can be further enhanced by the land use changes.

TI  - Evaluating generative adversarial networks based image-level domain transfer for multi-source remote sensing image segmentation and object detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Appearances and qualities of remote sensing images are affected by different atmospheric conditions, quality of sensors, and radiometric calibrations. This heavily challenges the generalization ability of a deep learning or other machine learning model: the performance of a model pretrained on a source remote sensing data set can significantly decrease when applied to a different target data set. The popular generative adversarial networks (GANs) can realize style or appearance transfer between a source and target data sets, which may boost the performance of a deep learning model through generating new target images similar to source samples. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of GAN-based image-level transfer methods on convolutional neural network (CNN) based image processing models that are trained on one dataset and tested on another one. Firstly, we designed the framework for the evaluation process. The framework consists of two main parts, the GAN-based image-level domain adaptation, which transfers a target image to a new image with similar probability distribution of source image space, and the CNN-based image processing tasks, which are used to test the effects of GAN-based domain adaptation. Second, the domain adaptation is implemented with two mainstream GAN methods for style transfer, the CycleGAN and the AgGAN. The image processing contains two major tasks, segmentation and object detection. The former and the latter are designed based on the widely applied U-Net and Faster R-CNN, respectively. Finally, three experiments, associated with three datasets, are designed to cover different application cases, a change detection case where temporal data is collected from the same scene, a two-city case where images are collected from different regions and a two-sensor case where images are obtained from aerial and satellite platforms respectively. Results revealed that, the GAN-based image transfer can significantly boost the performance of the segmentation model in the change detection case, however, it did not surpass conventional methods; in the other two cases, the GAN-based methods obtained worse results. In object detection, almost all the methods failed to boost the performance of the Faster R-CNN and the GAN-based methods performed the worst.

TI  - An improvement in accuracy and spatiotemporal continuity of the MODIS precipitable water vapor product based on a data fusion approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is among the key variables in the water and energy cycles, whereas current PWV products are limited by spatiotemporal discontinuity, low accuracy, and/or coarse spatial resolution. Based on two widely used global PWV products, i.e., satellite-based MODIS and reanalysis-based ERA5 products, here we propose a data fusion approach to generate PWV maps of spatiotemporal continuity and high resolution (0.01 degrees, daily) for the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, referred to as the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) basin in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the monsoon period (May - September) from 2007 to 2013. Results show that the fused PWV estimates have good agreement with PWV estimates from nine GPS stations (i.e., correlation coefficient: 0.87-0.97, overall bias: -0.4-1.8 mm, and root-mean-square error: 1.1-2.0 mm), greatly improving the accuracy of the MODIS PWV product. The fused PWV maps of high spatial resolution provide detailed and reasonable spatial variations which are generally consistent with those from the MODIS estimates under confident clear conditions and ERA5. Mean monthly PWV estimates across the UBR basin vary from similar to 6 to similar to 12 mm during the study period, and for each month high PWV values are found along the UBR valley and at the basin outlet. The developed data fusion approach maximizes the potential of satellite and reanalysis-based PWV products for retrieving PWV and has the potential to be applied to other high-mountain regions. The generated PWV estimates for the UBR basin are valuable in understanding the water and energy cycles and in retrieving atmospheric and surface variables for the southern TP including the Himalaya.

TI  - Study on the benefits of SO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction in emission control area based on OMI data
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship exhaust is one of the main sources of marine pollution. Since the establishment of the air pollutant emission control zone for ships in 2016, the emissions of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from ships have been significantly reduced. In order to analyze the emission reduction effect of atmospheric SO2 in the the Bohai Bay, the data-tracing product of OMI sensor carried by Aura satellite, was selected for atmospheric SO2 data inversion. The OMI level-2 data of each month in 2017 were selected to extract the SO2 column volume value in the atmospheric boundary layer, and the spatial analysis method was used to analyze its temporal and spatial changes to monitor the emission reduction effect in the emission control area. Results show that the value of SO2 in spring and winter is significantly higher than that in other seasons, and the annual change is relatively obvious. Since 2016, the peak value of total SO2 column has decreased year by year, and the high value area has gradually reduced, proving that the establishment of emission control area has a positive effect on air quality assurance.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Partitioning at Field Scales Using TSEB and Multi-Satellite Data Fusion in The Middle Reaches of Heihe River Basin, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily evapotranspiration (ET) and its components of evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) at field scale are often required for improving agricultural water management and maintaining ecosystem health, especially in semiarid and arid regions. In this study, multi-year daily ET, E, and T at a spatial resolution of 100 m in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin were computed based on an ET partitioning method developed by combing remote sensing-based ET model and multi-satellite data fusion methodology. Evaluations using flux tower measurements over irrigated cropland and natural desert sites indicate that this method can provide reliable estimates of surface flux partitioning and daily ET. Modeled daily ET yielded root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.85 mm for cropland site and 0.84 mm for desert site, respectively. The E and T partitioning capabilities of this proposed method was further assessed by using ratios E/ET and T/ET derived from isotopic technology at the irrigated cropland site. Results show that apart from early in the growing season when the actual E was reduced by plastic film mulching, the modeled E/ET and T/ET agree well with observations in terms of both magnitude and temporal dynamics. The multi-year seasonal patterns of modeled ET, E, and T at field scale from this ET partitioning method shows reasonable seasonal variation and spatial variability, which can be used for monitoring plant water consumption in both agricultural and natural ecosystems.

TI  - Triple-Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanocapsules for <i>in Vivo</i> Bioimaging
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problem that it is difficult to immobilize triple-triplet annihilation based upconversion (TTA-UC) for biological application, water soluble nanocapsules with n-hexadecane core containing a TTA-UC system were synthesized by a one-step miniemulsion polymerization. In the TTA-UC system, silicon phthalocyanine excited by red light source as sensitizer and rubrene with high efficiency as receptor were introduced into n-hexadecane to endow the nanocapsules with upconversion emission. The TTA-UC nanocapsules (TT-UCNP) have a typical core-shell structure with a uniform size of 190 nm. To eliminate the quenching effect of molecular oxygen on upconversion luminescence, D-limonene and polyisobutylene were selected as anti-oxidant, and the TTA-UCNP showed bright upconversion emission. The TTA-UCNP have been successfully applied in in vivo imaging of sentinel lymph node (SLN) with high signal-to-noise ratio and long-term tracing.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Retrieval Under Different Aridity Conditions Over North American Grasslands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most critical parameters in water- and energy-related domains. Two basic assumptions with respect to soil-moisture variation have been widely investigated for the retrieval of ET based on the trapezoid methods. Specifically, soil moisture within the surface and root-zone layers was assumed to vary synchronously in most of the earlier analyses. However, several recent investigations assumed that soil moisture within the upper soil layer should be dried up before the root-zone layer is stressed. To this end, the retrieval of ET under different aridity conditions over North American grasslands was investigated with the two assumptions, and the estimated ET was assessed using the flux data collected from eight AmeriFlux sites. Based on the available data from 2002 to 2018, results showed that the asynchronous-assumed method can obtain better ET estimates than the synchronous-assumed method over semiarid and subhumid areas, whereas the synchronous-assumed method can obtain better ET estimates in humid areas. Moreover, because of the different closure techniques used for the ET correction, no consistent conclusions could be found for the arid conditions to determine which trapezoid was better. Specifically, it was found that the cases of surface soil with zero water availability that were defined by the asynchronous-assumed trapezoid method rarely occur, even in arid areas, which indicated that the critical boundary that determines whether the root-zone layer begins to be water-stressed may need to be redefined.

TI  - Monitoring for Changes in Spring Phenology at Both Temporal and Spatial Scales Based on MODIS LST Data in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to monitor spatiotemporal changes of spring phenology using the green-up start dates based on the accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which were deducted from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data. The green-up start dates were extracted from the MODIS-derived AGDD and EVI for 30 Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.) stands throughout South Korea. The relationship between green-up day of year needed to reach the AGDD threshold (DoY(AGDD)) and air temperature was closely maintained in data in both MODIS image interpretation and from 93 meteorological stations. Leaf green-up dates of Mongolian oak based on the AGDD threshold obtained from the records measured at five meteorological stations during the last century showed the same trend as the result of cherry observed visibly. Extrapolating the results, the spring onset of Mongolian oak and cherry has become earlier (14.5 +/- 4.3 and 10.7 +/- 3.6 days, respectively) with the rise of air temperature over the last century. The temperature in urban areas was consistently higher than that in the forest and the rural areas and the result was reflected on the vegetation phenology. Our study expanded the scale of the study on spring vegetation phenology spatiotemporally by combining satellite images with meteorological data. We expect our findings could be used to predict long-term changes in ecosystems due to climate change.

TI  - Monitoring Land Cover Change on a Rapidly Urbanizing Island Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Island ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change and human activities. The change of land use and land cover (LULC) has considerable impacts on island ecosystems, and there is a critical need for a free and open-source tool for detecting land cover fluctuations and spatial distribution. This study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore land cover classification and the spatial pattern of major land cover change from 1990 to 2019 on Haitan Island, China. The land cover classification was performed using multiple spectral bands (RGB, NIR, SWIR), vegetation indices (NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI), and tasseled cap transformation of Landsat images based on the random forest supervised algorithm. The major land cover conversion processes (transfer to and from) between 1990 and 2019 were analyzed in detail for the years of 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2019, and the overall accuracies ranged from 88.43% to 91.08%, while the Kappa coefficients varied from 0.86 to 0.90. During 1990-2019, other land, cultivated land, sandy land, and water area decreased by 30.70%, 13.63%, 3.76%, and 0.95%, respectively, while forest and built-up land increased by 30.94% and 16.20% of the study area, respectively. The predominant land cover was other land (34.49%) and cultivated land (26.80%) in 1990, which transitioned to forest land (53.57%) and built-up land (23.07%) in 2019. Reforestation, cultivated land reduction, and built-up land expansion were the major land cover change processes on Haitan Island. The spatial pattern of forest, cultivated land, and built-up land change is mainly explained by the implementation of a 'Grain for Green Project' and 'Comprehensive Pilot Zone' policy on Haitan Island. Policy and human activities are the major drivers for land use change, including reforestation, population growth, and economic development. This study is unique because it demonstrates the use of GEE for continuous monitoring of the impact of reforestation efforts and urbanization in an island environment.

TI  - Monitoring surface water area variations of reservoirs using daily MODIS images by exploring sub-pixel information
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the temporal variation of surface water area of reservoirs is fundamental for water resource management and is often monitored by satellite remote sensing. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery is an attractive data source for the routine monitoring of reservoirs, however, the accuracy is often limited due to the negative impacts associated with its coarse spatial resolution and the effects of cloud contamination. Methods have been proposed to solve these two problems independently but it remains challenging to address both problems simultaneously. To overcome this, this paper proposes a new approach that aims to monitor reservoir surface water area variations accurately and timely from daily MODIS images by exploring sub-pixel scale information. The proposed approach used estimates of reservoir water areas obtained from cloud-free and relatively fine spatial resolution Landsat images and water fraction images by spectral unmixing of coarse MODIS imagery as reference data. For each MODIS pixel, these reference reservoir water areas and their corresponding pixel water fractions were used to construct a linear regression equation, which in turn may be applied to predict the time series of reservoir water areas from daily MODIS water fraction images. The proposed approach was assessed with 21 reservoirs, where the correlation coefficients between reservoir water areas predicted by the common pixel-based analysis method and altimetry water levels were all less than 0.5. With the proposed sub-pixel analysis method, the resultant correlation coefficients were much improved, with eleven values larger than 0.5 including six values larger than 0.8 and the highest value of 0.94. The results show that the proposed sub-pixel analysis method is superior to the pixel based analysis method. The proposed method makes it possible to directly estimate the whole reservoir water area from, potentially, an individual cloud-free MODIS pixel, and is a promising way to improve the accuracy in the usability of MODIS images for the monitoring of reservoir surface water area variations.

TI  - Sustainability Education and Environmental Worldviews: Shifting a Paradigm
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher education institutions are tasked with education for sustainable development, of which the environment is a central pillar. Understanding the demographic factors that influence the establishment of environmental worldviews allows educators to better contextualize sustainability content and discussion. Identifying pedagogies capable of creating learning spaces within which worldviews can shift offers similar opportunities. Using a quasi-experimental design and model building, this study identifies important social psychological antecedents of environmental beliefs, assesses the effectiveness of outbound mobility pedagogy at changing those beliefs and identifies important predictors of the nature and magnitude of those changes. Sustainable outbound mobility courses were effective at increasing environmental worldview compared to a control group. At program commencement, political orientation and business majors were negatively associated with environmental worldview, while female gender was the reverse. For sustainability education courses, only gender was retained as a significant predictor of the nature and change of environmental worldview by the course's end. These results suggest that the factors associated with environmental worldview upon commencement of a course do not necessarily predict the malleability of that worldview in higher education students.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Their Driving Factors in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau Based on Geographical Detectors and Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Gannan Prefecture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important production base for livestock and a unique ecological zone in China, the northeast Tibetan Plateau has experienced dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) changes with increasing human activities and continuous climate change. However, extensive cloud cover limits the ability of optical remote sensing satellites to monitor accurately LULC changes in this area. To overcome this problem in LULC mapping in the Ganan Prefecture, 2000-2018, we used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and random forest algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The dynamic trends of LULC changes were analyzed, and geographical detectors quantitatively evaluated the key driving factors of these changes. The results showed that (1) the overall classification accuracy varied between 89.14% and 91.41%, and the kappa values were greater than 86.55%, indicating that the classification results were reliably accurate. (2) The major LULC types in the study area were grassland and forest, and their area accounted for 50% and 25%, respectively. During the study period, the grassland area decreased, while the area of forest land and construction land increased to varying degrees. The land-use intensity presents multi-level intensity, and it was higher in the northeast than that in the southwest. (3) Elevation and population density were the major driving factors of LULC changes, and economic development has also significantly affected LULC. These findings revealed the main factors driving LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and provided a reference for assisting in the development of sustainable land management and ecological protection policy decisions.

TI  - Observations of water transparency in China's lakes from space
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency, usually denoted by Secchi disk depth (SSD), represents the first-order description of water quality and has important implications for the diversity and productivity of aquatic life. In China, lakes supply freshwater and ecosystem services to nearly a billion people. Therefore, real time monitoring of lake transparency is of great significance. Moreover, understanding how and why transparency varies in space and time in response to different driving forces is needed to understand, manage, and predict lake water quality. Based on the time-saving and low-cost Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this study developed a new algorithm for quickly mapping SDDs in Chinese lakes. SDDs were retrieved for 412 Chinese lakes (> 20 km(2)) for the period 2000-2018. Results demonstrated that lake water depth spatially differentiated transparency. Deep lakes usually had high transparency and water depth explained 88.81 % of the spatial variations. With increasing catchment vegetation coverage and lake water depth, 70.15 % of lakes witnessed increasing transparency during 2000-2018. Of these 42.72 % were significant (p < 0.05). Transparency of deep lakes was generally determined by phytoplankton density not sediment resuspension. Minimum transparency occurred in summer. Future increases in lake water levels in response to factors such as climate change may contribute to further improvements in transparency. Management should focus on controlling eutrophication and increasing vegetation cover in catchments.

TI  - Forty-year water body changes in Poyang Lake and the ecological impacts based on Landsat and HJ-1 A/B observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming and aggravation due to human activities, many lakes on Earth are facing a series of worsening environmental problems, such as shrinking areas and declining water quality. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, an important wetland in the world and the largest migratory bird habitat in Asia. The ecological environment of the lake has a widespread influence and has attracted international attention. It is necessary to use long-term frequent satellite observations to investigate the Poyang Lake due to its high-frequency fluctuations characteristics. However, most remote sensing data cover only a short period of time, which cannot reflect the long-term change to the Poyang Lake water, no satellite mission currently fits such requirements. Based on HJ-1A/B and Landsat data from 1989 to 2018, the dynamic changes in water quantity in Poyang Lake are monitored in this paper, and the influencing factors and ecological impacts of the changes are analyzed. The results show that in terms of the water area change trend, on the annual scale, the annual mean values of water area and water volume exhibit overall decreasing trends. The water area was the largest in 1998 at 4068.33 km(2) and smallest in 2014 at 899.68 km(2); the water volume was largest in 1992 at 25,810 million m(3) and smallest in 2014 at 5880 million m(3). On the monthly scale, the water area was the smallest in January, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from January to July; subsequently, a decreasing trend was observed from August to January. The water volume was smallest in February, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from February to July; then, a decreasing trend was observed from August to February. The water volume of Poyang Lake is affected by seasonal changes in precipitation, and the correlation coefficient between monthly precipitation and monthly water volume is 0.603 (P < 0.05). In summer, the water volume is affected by the water level in the Yangtze River; the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River caused a prolonged duration of the low water period and an advanced low water period, which are also important factors affecting the water volume change. In terms of the impact of water volume on ecology, the relationship between water volume and NH3-N concentration is obvious, with a correlation coefficient of - 0.679 (P < 0.01). A large water volume will increase the lake water level, reduce the habitats for migratory birds, and provide food to fewer migratory birds.

TI  - Patch Pattern and Ecological Risk Assessment of Alpine Grassland in the Source Region of the Yellow River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is an important water conservation and animal husbandry resource in China. It is of great significance to understand the patch pattern and ecological risk of alpine grassland in the SRYR for ecological environment management. This study first used 12 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial images and eight moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index product MOD13Q1 images from July to August in 2019 to extract alpine grassland patch patterns in the SRYR, then constructed an ecological risk model based on the landscape vulnerability index and landscape disturbance index, and finally combined spatial self-reliance correlation and semi-variance analysis methods to explore the spatial distribution of ecological risks. The results showed that the patch fragmentation degree (Pi), area weighted shape index (AWMSI), and separation degree (Si) of the four grassland types in the SRYR are ordered as follows: alpine steppe > degraded meadow > alpine meadow > swamp meadow. Moreover, the greater the fractional vegetation cover (FVC), the greater the landscape dominance index (DOi), and the better the ecosystem stability. The spatial difference of ecological risk in the SRYR shows a situation of low risk in the east (ERImin = 1.5355) and high risk in the west (ERImax = 70.6429). High FVC was found in low and mild low risk areas where the vegetation types are mainly swamp meadow and shrub, while low FVC was found in high and mild high-risk areas where the vegetation types are mainly alpine steppe and degraded meadow. The spatial distribution of ecological risk of the SRYR has obvious positive spatial correlation (Moran's I = 0.863), the spatial aggregation distribution is distinct, and the local space has significant high-high aggregation and low-low aggregation phenomena. The results of this study reveal that patch characteristics have good indicative significance for alpine grassland ecological protection and should be considered in future studies. In addition, the ecological risk in the SRYR is relatively high, especially in the western region, which should be taken seriously in future ecological management and governance.

TI  - Estimation of glacier mass loss and its contribution to river runoff in the source region of the Yangtze River during 2000-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid climatic warming, glaciers in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR) generally experienced apparent terminus retreats over the past several decades. However, the influence of glacier melting in the river runoff of the SRYR remains poorly known due to lack of glacier mass balance measurements. In this study, we derived the glacier mass changes of the SRYR in 2000-2018 by comparing the digital elevation models (DEMs) produced from ZiYuan-3 tri-stereo scenes with the SRTM DEM. Glacier mass balances were spatially heterogeneous (range from -0.55 +/- 0.12 to -0.14 +/- 0.05 m w.e. yr(-1)) in the SRYR, which may be mainly attributed to the spatial difference in snowfall variation. Overall, the glacier mass loss of - 0.343 +/- 0.055 Gt yr(-1) was estimated for the entire SRYR. By using the hydrological data recorded by the Zhimenda station, we calculated the annual runoff of 17.84 Gt yr(-1) between 2000 and 2018. Therefore, the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the SRYR was only 1.9 +/- 0.3% in 2000-2018. Our results reveal that glacier melting was not the major water resource in the SRYR during recent decades.

TI  - Mapping Ratoon Rice Planting Area in Central China Using Sentinel-2 Time Stacks and the Phenology-Based Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping rice cropping systems is important for grain yield prediction and food security assessments. Both single- and double-season rice are the dominant rice systems in central China. However, because of increasing labor shortages and high costs, there has been a gradual decline in double-season rice. Ratoon rice (RR) has been proposed as an alternative system that balances the productivity, cost, and labor requirements of rice cultivation. RR has been expanding in central China, encouraged by the improved cultivars, machinery, and favorable policies. However, to our knowledge, the distribution of RR has not been mapped with remote sensing techniques. This study developed a phenology-based algorithm to map RR at a 10 m resolution in Hubei Province, Central China, using dense time stacks of Sentinel-2 images (cloud cover <80%) in 2018. The key in differentiating RR from the other rice cropping systems is through the timing of maturity. We proposed to use two contrast vegetation indices to identify RR fields. The newly-developed yellowness index (YI) calculated with the reflectance of blue, green, and red bands was used to detect the ripening phase, and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used to detect the green-up of the second-season crop to eliminate the misclassification caused by stubbles left in the field. The RR map demonstrated that RR was mainly distributed in the low alluvial plains of central and southern Hubei Province. The total planting area of RR in 2018 was 2225.4 km(2), accounting for 10.03% of the total area of paddy rice fields. The overall accuracy of RR, non-RR rice fields, and non-rice land cover types was 0.76. The adjusted overall accuracy for RR and non-RR was 0.91, indicating that the proposed YI and the phenology-based algorithm could accurately identify RR fields from the paddy rice fields.

TI  - Downscaling Satellite Retrieved Soil Moisture Using Regression Tree-Based Machine Learning Algorithms Over Southwest France
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrieved soil moisture (SM) shows great potential in hydrological, meteorological, ecological, and agricultural applications, while the coarse resolution limits its utilization in regional scale. The regression tree-based machine learning algorithms reveal promising capability in SM downscaling. However, it lacks systematic study dedicated to intercomparisons of algorithms to explicitly illuminate their characteristics. In this study, comparisons are made to systematically evaluate performances of classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF), gradient boost decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boost (XGB) in Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM downscaling in southwest France. The results show that the four algorithms downscaled SM are capable of capturing spatial distribution features of the original SMAP SM. The downscaled regions with favorable accuracy are mostly situated in the dominant Mediterranean climate zone with moderate vegetation coverage and mild topography variation. The best results are obtained by GBDT in grassland with R value of 0.77 and ubRMSE value of 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The RF and XGB also achieve good performances. On the whole, the GBDT approach is robust and reliable, which could downscale SM with superior correlation and smaller bias than the others. Besides, it achieves higher accuracy than the original SMAP in grassland and shrubland. The feature importance index of each explainable variable fluctuates regularly among different seasons and models. This study proves the outstanding performance of GBDT in SMAP SM downscaling and is expected to act as a valuable reference for studies focusing on SM scale conversion algorithms.

TI  - Understanding the role of phenology and summer physiology in controlling net ecosystem production: a multiscale comparison of satellite, PhenoCam and eddy covariance data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the temporal and spatial variability (SV) of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is critical for coupling ecosystem carbon (C) cycle and climate system. Previous studies have shown responses of NEP to changes of plant phenology, but impacts of summer physiological status on annual NEP and how this may vary across different ecosystems and spatial scales were largely unknown. Combining large regional satellite derived indices (MODIS), 676 site-year local data (FLUXDATA) covering seven vegetation types, and 57 site-year regional data (PhenoCam), we found that phenological metrics and summer physiological indicators were significantly correlated with their respective gross primary production-based estimates. The interannual variability of NEP was mostly explained by summer physiology than phenology for most ecosystems, while phenology showed a better performance than summer physiology only for grassland sites. In comparison, inconsistent results were derived from three scales when explaining the SV of NEP. Summer physiology showed more potential in interpreting the SV of NEP at large regional scale, but both physiology and the length of growing season exhibited similar performances at local scale. Observations from regional scale were not able to explain NEP, given that the green chromatic coordinate signal cannot track photosynthesis in summer with a high canopy closure. The finding highlights the important role of summer physiology in controlling the C accumulation of terrestrial ecosystems and understanding the responses of summer physiology to environmental drivers is of great significance for improving the simulation accuracy of C sequestration under the global climate change.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining cosmic microwave (CMB) background data from Planck satellite data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data, we obtain the bounds on total neutrino masses M-v with the approximation of degenerate neutrino masses and for three dark energy models: the cosmological constant (ACDM) model, a phenomenological emergent dark energy (PEDE) model and a model-independent quintessential parametrization (HBK). The bounds on the sum of neutrino masses M-v, depend on the dark energy (DE) models. In the HBK model, we confirm the conclusion from some previous work that the quintessence prior of DE tends to tighten the cosmological constraint on M-v. On the other hand, the PEDE model leads to larger M-v and a nonzero lower bound. Besides, we also explore the correlation between three different neutrino hierarchies and DE models.

TI  - <i>Prodiamesa olivacea</i>: <i>de novo</i> biomarker genes in a potential sentinel organism for ecotoxicity studies in natural scenarios
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with traditional ecotoxicological approaches in model organisms, toxicological studies in non-model organisms are being taken into consideration in order to complement them and contribute to more robust approaches. This allows us to figure out the complexity of the exposures involved in natural ecosystems. In this context, in the present research we have used the model species Chironomus riparius (Chironomidae, Diptera) and the non-model species Prodiamesa olivacea (Chironomidae, Diptera) to assess the aquatic toxic effects of acute 4-h and 24-h exposures to 1 mu gL(-1) of three common environmental pollutants: butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), bisphenol A (BPA), and benzophenone 3 (BP3). Individuals of both species were collected from a contaminated river (Sar) in Galicia (Spain).Regarding Chironomus, there are four OECD standardized tests for the evaluation of water and sediment toxicity, in which different species in this genus can be used to assess classical toxicity parameters such as survival, immobilization, reproduction, and development. In contrast, Prodiamesa is rarely used in toxicity studies, even though it is an interesting toxicological species because it shares habitats with Chironomus but requires less extreme conditions (e.g., contamination) and higher oxygen levels. These different requirements are particularly interesting in assessing the different responses of both species to pollutant exposure.Quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the transcriptional changes caused by xenobiotics in different genes of interest. Since information about P. olivacea in genomic databases is scarce, its transcriptome was obtained using de novo RNAseq. Genes involved in biotransformation pathways and the oxidative stress response (MnSOD, CAT, PHGPx, Cyp4g15, Cyp6a14-like and Cyp6a2-like) were de novo identified in this species. Our results show differential toxic responses depending on the species and the xenobiotic, being P. olivacea the dipteran that showed the most severe effects in most of the studied biomarker genes.This work represents a multi-species approach that allows us to deepen in the toxicity of BBP, BPA, and BP3 at the molecular level. Besides, it provides an assessment of the tolerance/sensitivity of natural populations of model and non-model insect species chronically exposed to complex mixtures of pollutants in natural scenarios. These findings may have important implications for understanding the adverse biological effects of xenobiotics on P. olivacea, providing new sensitive biomarkers of exposure to BBP, BPA, and BP3. It also highlights the suitability of Prodiamesa for ecotoxicological risk assessment, especially in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Local rainfall or river overflow? Re-evaluating the cause of the Great 2011 Thailand flood
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great 2011 Thailand flood is one of the most catastrophic flood disasters recorded worldwide in modern history, which covered about 100,000 km(2) of the country and resulted in 813 casualties and incurring US$ 46 billion in economic losses. In this paper, we re-evaluate the flood event to identify the root source of the catastrophe. By analyzing hydrological data from gauge stations along the Chao Phraya River (CPR) and remote sensing data, we decoupled the volumetric contributions of river overflow and local rainfall to the lowland reach of the basin and found that the latter contributed most to the flooding. More specifically, out of the total of 77.6 km(3) of floodwaters estimated, 73.7% was from precipitation, while only 26.3% was from river discharges. This finding differs from the official reports or previous studies, which attributed the main cause of the river overbank flow. Therefore, it is also inferred that the upstream dam operations would have been only marginally helpful in mitigating the flood since rainfall made up most of the floodwaters in the downstream reach of the river. Our finding offers a new perspective that the local rainfall could be a significant source of the floodwater, rather than river overflow in the lower reaches of a large monsoonal river system in Southeast Asia. Thus, this paper contributes to the understanding of complex flood processes in large river basins and provides fresh insights for efficient flood control and stormwater management.

TI  - INCREASE IN WATER-SCARCITY RISK IN A BRAZILIAN DRY-REGION RESERVOIR
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the extent to which silting increases water-scarcity risk, considering the temporal reduction of water availability and increased demand using land use and water-demand scenarios at the transition of Caatinga and Cerrado biomes of the Bocaina reservoir watershed (10(2)hm(3)), in the Brazilian dry region. Methodological steps were: reservoir silting measured in-situ 20 years after dam construction; climate variables computed with the aid of a conventional station (2005-2014); soil erodibility assessed using 16 soil samples; and topography and land cover estimated based on 21 years of Landsat imagery. Three land use scenarios were generated (invariability, degradation and preservation) with the climate scenario derived from the semi-arid rainfall temporal variability; whereas two water-demand scenarios (invariability and higher efficiency) were a function of the efficiency of the irrigation systems. Water availability was calculated using the volume-yield elasticity (VYELAS) Model. The field results (1985-2015) showed a gross erosion rate of 13.5 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) in the basin. The annual sediment yield (1.7 Mg.ha(-1)) and the decadal reservoir silting (1.0%) were below regional average due to the low sediment delivery ratio (12.6%) in the area. Scenario projections (2040) suggest water demand may double if irrigation methods do not improve, whereas siltation may cause water availability to decrease up to 10% in the period. In this case, the water-supply reliability will be below the recommended standard value (90%), regardless of the land use scenario. Nevertheless, simultaneous soil preservation and improved irrigation efficiency can reduce the decadal water-scarcity risk from 82% (worst scenario) to 17%.

TI  - Evaluation of a New Merged Sea-Ice Concentration Dataset at 1 km Resolution from Thermal Infrared and Passive Microwave Satellite Data in the Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-ice concentration (SIC) data with fine spatial resolution and spatially continuous coverage are needed, for example, for estimating heat fluxes. Passive microwave measurements of the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) offer spatial continuity, but are limited to spatial resolutions of 5 km and coarser. Thermal infrared data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provide a spatial resolution of 1 km, but are limited to cloud-free scenes. We exploit the benefits of both and present a merged SIC dataset with 1 km spatial resolution and spatially continuous coverage for the Arctic. MODIS and AMSR2 SIC are retrieved separately and then merged by tuning the MODIS SIC to preserve the mean AMSR2 SIC. We first evaluate the variability of the dynamically retrieved MODIS ice tie-point. Varying the starting position of the area used for the tie-point retrieval changes the MODIS SIC by on average 1.9%, which we mitigate by considering different starting positions and using the average as ice tie-point. Furthermore, the SIC datasets are evaluated against a reference dataset derived from Sentinel-2A/B reflectances between February and May 2019. We find that the merged SIC are 1.9% smaller than the reference SIC if thin ice is considered as ice and 4.9% higher if thin ice is considered as water. There is only a slight bias (0.3%) between the MODIS and the merged SIC; however, the root mean square deviation of 5% indicates that the two datasets do yield different results. In an example of poor-quality MODIS SIC, we identify an unscreened cloud and high ice-surface temperature as reasons for the poor quality. Still, the merged SIC are of similar quality as the passive microwave SIC in this example. The benefit of merging MODIS and AMSR2 data is demonstrated by showing that the finer resolution of the merged SIC compared to the AMSR2 SIC allows an enhanced potential for the retrieval of leads. At the same time, the data are available regardless of clouds. Last, we provide uncertainty estimates. The MODIS and merged SIC uncertainty are between 5% and 10% from February to April and increase up to 25% (merged SIC) and 35% (MODIS SIC) in May. They are identified as conservative uncertainty estimates.

TI  - Comparison of SLSTR Thermal Emissive Bands Clear-Sky Measurements with Those of Geostationary Imagers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 series satellites belong to the European Earth Observation satellite missions for supporting oceanography, land, and atmospheric studies. The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard the Sentinel-3 satellites was designed to provide a significant improvement in remote sensing of skin sea surface temperature (SSTskin). The successful application of SLSTR-derived SSTskin fields depends on their accuracies. Based on sensor-dependent radiative transfer model simulations, geostationary Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imagers (ABI) and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-4) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) brightness temperatures (BT) have been transformed to SLSTR equivalents to permit comparisons at the pixel level in three ocean regions. The results show the averaged BT differences are on the order of 0.1 K and the existence of small biases between them are likely due to the uncertainties in cloud masking, satellite view angle, solar azimuth angle, and reflected solar light. This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining SSTskin retrievals from SLSTR with those of ABI and SEVIRI.

TI  - STAIR 2.0: A Generic and Automatic Algorithm to Fuse Modis, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 to Generate 10 m, Daily, and Cloud-/Gap-Free Surface Reflectance Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing datasets with both high spatial and high temporal resolution are critical for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of land surfaces. However, no current satellite sensor could simultaneously achieve both high spatial resolution and high revisiting frequency. Therefore, the integration of different sources of satellite data to produce a fusion product has become a popular solution to address this challenge. Many methods have been proposed to generate synthetic images with rich spatial details and high temporal frequency by combining two types of satellite datasets-usually frequent coarse-resolution images (e.g., MODIS) and sparse fine-resolution images (e.g., Landsat). In this paper, we introduce STAIR 2.0, a new fusion method that extends the previous STAIR fusion framework, to fuse three types of satellite datasets, including MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel-2. In STAIR 2.0, input images are first processed to impute missing-value pixels that are due to clouds or sensor mechanical issues using a gap-filling algorithm. The multiple refined time series are then integrated stepwisely, from coarse- to fine- and high-resolution, ultimately providing a synthetic daily, high-resolution surface reflectance observations. We applied STAIR 2.0 to generate a 10-m, daily, cloud-/gap-free time series that covers the 2017 growing season of Saunders County, Nebraska. Moreover, the framework is generic and can be extended to integrate more types of satellite data sources, further improving the quality of the fusion product.

TI  - Inventory and Distribution of Rock Glaciers in Northeastern Yakutia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers are common forms of relief of the periglacial belt of many mountain structures in the world. They are potential sources of water in arid and semi-arid regions, and therefore their analysis is important in assessing water reserves. Mountain structures in the north-east of Yakutia have optimal conditions for the formation of rock glaciers, but they have not yet been studied in this regard. In this article, for the first time, we present a detailed list of rock glaciers in this region. Based on geoinformation mapping using remote sensing data and field studies within the Chersky, Verkhoyansk, Momsky and Suntar-Khayata ranges, 4503 rock glaciers with a total area of 224.6 km(2) were discovered. They are located within absolute altitudes, from 503 to 2496 m. Their average minimum altitude was at 1456 m above sea level, and the maximum at 1527 m. Most of these formations are located on the sides of the trough valleys, and form extended sloping types of rock glaciers. An assessment of the exposure of the slopes where the rock glaciers are located showed that most of the rock glaciers are facing north and south.

TI  - Analyzing Ecological Vulnerability and Vegetation Phenology Response Using NDVI Time Series Data and the BFAST Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying ecologically vulnerable areas and understanding the responses of phenology to negative changes in vegetation growth are important bases for ecological restoration. However, identifying ecologically vulnerable areas is difficult because it requires high spatial resolution and dense temporal resolution data over a long time period. In this study, a novel method is presented to identify ecologically vulnerable areas based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from MOD09A1. Here, ecologically vulnerable areas are defined as those that experienced negative changes frequently and greatly in vegetation growth after the disturbances during 2000-2018. The number and magnitude of negative changes detected by the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm based on the NDVI time-series data were combined to identify ecologically vulnerable areas. TIMESAT was then used to extract the phenology metrics from an NDVI time series dataset to characterize the vegetation responses due to the abrupt negative changes detected by the BFAST algorithm. Focus was given to Jilin Province, a region of China known to be ecologically vulnerable because of frequent drought. The results showed that 13.52% of the study area, mostly in Jilin Province, is ecologically vulnerable. The vulnerability of trees is the lowest, while that of sparse vegetation is the highest. The response of phenology is such that the relative amount of vegetation biomass and length of the growing period were decreased by negative changes in growth for dense vegetation types. The present research results will be useful for the protection of environments being disturbed by regional ecological restoration.

TI  - Simulation of the Dynamic Water Storage and Its Gravitational Effect in the Head Region of Three Gorges Reservoir Using Imageries of Gaofen-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of a high-resolution dynamic water storage model, driven by the mass load of the huge water storage of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), is the necessary basic data for accurately simulating changes in the geophysical field, e.g., gravity, crustal deformation, and stress. However, previously established models cannot meet the needs of accurately simulating the impoundment effects of TGR, because these models were simplified and approximated and did not consider the variation of river boundaries caused by water level changes. In this study, we combined high-resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite imageries and real-time water level in front of the dam and extracted 31 river boundaries of the head region of TGR between the lowest (145 m) and the highest (175 m) impoundment stages based on the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) and threshold segmentation from Otsu method. Developed dynamic water storage model based on higher-resolution GF-1 data can show the true river boundary changes more exactly, especially in local areas. Compared to the previous approximate models, the model that we constructed accurately depicts the boundary distribution information of the different impoundment stages. Moreover, we simulated TGR-induced gravitational effects based on the high-precision forward modeling of the dynamic water storage model (i.e., considering changes of dynamic water area and water level). The theoretical modelled results are consistent with in situ gravity measurements with the difference mainly within 10 mu Gal. Our results indicate that water storage variations of TGR mainly affect the gravity field response within 1000 m of the reservoir bank with its maximum amplitude up to several hundred mu Gal. The dynamic water storage and its simulation results of gravitational effects can effectively eliminate the impact of surface water load driven by the TGR under human control and greatly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of regional gravity observational data. Thus, this work will be beneficial in the application of geophysical and geodetic monitoring aimed to comprehensively track the local and regional geological structural stability, e.g., artificial reservoir induced earthquake and landslide.

TI  - An Innovative Approach for Improving the Accuracy of Digital Elevation Models for Cultivated Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The redistribution of solar radiation, temperature, soil moisture and heat by topography affects the physical and chemical properties of the soil and the spatial distribution characteristics of crop growth. Analyses of the relationship between topography and these variables may help to improve the accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs). The purpose of correcting Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data is to obtain high-precision DEM data in cultivated land. A typical black soil area was studied. A high-precision reference DEM was generated from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and extensive measured ground elevation data. The normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), perpendicular drought index (PDI) extracted from SPOT-6 remote sensing images and potential solar radiation (PSR) extracted from SRTM. The interactions between topography and NDVI, PDI, and PSR were analyzed. The NDVI, PDI and PSR in June, July, August and September of 2016 and the SRTM were used as independent variables, and the UAV DEM was used as the dependent variable. Linear stepwise regression (LSR) and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) were used to establish an elevation prediction model. The results indicated that (1) The correlation between topography and NDVI, PSR, PDI was significant at 0.01 level. The PDI and PSR improved the spatial resolution of SRTM data and reduce the vertical error. (2) The BPNN (R-1(2) = 0.98, root mean square error, RMSE1 = 0.54) yielded a higher SRTM accuracy than did the studied linear model (RMSE1 = 1.00, R-1(2) = 0.90). (3) A series of significant improvements in the SRTM were observed when assessed with the reference DEMs for two different areas, with RMSE reductions of 91% (from 14.95 m to 1.23 m) and 93% (from 15.6 m to 0.94 m). The proposed method improved the accuracy of existing DEMs and could provide support for accurate farmland management.

TI  - New Developments in Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early-Stage Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryIn early-stage (cT1-2N0) oral cancer, occult lymph node metastases are present in 20-30% of patients. Accordingly, accurate staging of the clinically negative cervical nodal basin is warranted in these patients. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has proven to reliably stage the clinically negative cervical nodal basin in early-stage oral cancer. However, due to the limited resolution of conventional sentinel lymph node imaging, occult lymph node metastasis may be missed in particular circumstances. Therefore, technical developments are necessary to bring the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy, in early-stage oral cancer, to a higher level. This review evaluates novel sentinel lymph node imaging techniques for early-stage oral cancer, such as MR lymphography, CT lymphography, PET lymphoscintigraphy and contrast-enhanced lymphosonography. Their reported diagnostic accuracy is described and their relative merits, disadvantages and potential applications are outlined.Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a diagnostic staging procedure that aims to identify the first draining lymph node(s) from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), as their histopathological status reflects the histopathological status of the rest of the nodal basin. The routine SLNB procedure consists of peritumoral injections with a technetium-99m [Tc-99m]-labelled radiotracer followed by lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT imaging. Based on these imaging results, the identified SLNs are marked for surgical extirpation and are subjected to histopathological assessment. The routine SLNB procedure has proven to reliably stage the clinically negative neck in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, an infamous limitation arises in situations where SLNs are located in close vicinity of the tracer injection site. In these cases, the hotspot of the injection site can hide adjacent SLNs and hamper the discrimination between tracer injection site and SLNs (shine-through phenomenon). Therefore, technical developments are needed to bring the diagnostic accuracy of SLNB for early-stage OSCC to a higher level. This review evaluates novel SLNB imaging techniques for early-stage OSCC: MR lymphography, CT lymphography, PET lymphoscintigraphy and contrast-enhanced lymphosonography. Furthermore, their reported diagnostic accuracy is described and their relative merits, disadvantages and potential applications are outlined.

TI  - The Use of SAR Offset Tracking for Detecting Sand Dune Movement in Sudan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand movement is one of the main environmental hazards in Northern Sudan that threaten livelihood and rural communities. This paper investigates for the first time the use of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offset tracking technique for detecting sand movement in Northern Sudan, and distinguishes the impact of the movement influencing factors: wind speed/direction, vegetation and topography. High-resolution images from the Sentinel-1 satellite were used for the generation of displacement maps. Three different dune fields with different characteristics were investigated for a study period between 4 June and 14 October 2017 (133 days). Dune field 1 is vegetated and near a built-up area, dune field 2 is in an open environment with sand dunes overlaying rocky substrate, and dune field 3 is located near mountains. The cumulative east displacement over the study period was 1.8 m, -1.1 m and 4.8 m for the three dune fields, respectively, while the cumulative north displacement was 0.7 m, 2.9 m and 4.2 m. Large movement is detected in the non-vegetated dune fields, with an average dune velocity of 0.18 m/d, while the vegetated dune field had a velocity of 0.09 m/d, which emphasizes the fact that vegetation is an effective stabiliser of dune movement. The pixel offset results showed a positive correlation between the wind speed/direction and the dune movement. In addition to vegetation, topography also played a major role in diverting the direction of the blown sand mainly near the edges to the mountains and the vegetation barriers. This technique showed high competency in monitoring the movement of sand dunes, in addition to identifying areas exposed to large sand drifting as a risk mapping technique.

TI  - LAND USE/COVER CHANGE IN DINEVAR RURAL AREA OF WEST IRAN DURING 2000-2018 AND ITS PREDICTION FOR 2024 AND 2030
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change, monitoring and predicting the future land use is often demanded by decision makers. Many land use change models have been developed aiming at the accurate prediction of land use changes. This study is aimed at mapping land use changes during past years and predicting the future trends in the rural environment of the Dinevar region to support local decision makers. For this research, we used the archive of Landsat satellite images of 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 to investigate the land-use changes in and initial pre-processes such as geometrical correction, radiometric correction. PCA was utilised to reduce the bands and multi-spectral images were fused with panchromatic band using Gram-Schmidt method to increase spatial separation. Four land uses of agriculture, rocky lands, pasture and bare soil were extracted through maximum likelihood method and predictions are made using CA-Markov chain. Land use for 2018 was predicted and the results were compared with the field observations, to evaluate the validity of the prediction method. Finally, the prediction was conducted for 2024 and 2030 land use. The highest extent of changes in the study period (2000-2030) was related to the change from pasture to bare soil with 1689 hectares. Based on the results, 0.7499% of changes were occurred between 2000 and 2006, 0.8562% between 2000 and 2012, and remaining 15% from 2012 to 2018. It indicates that the highest rate of changes in the area occurred within 2000-2006, while stagnation occurred in the period of 2006 to 2012. These changes increased during the last 5-years due to the promotion of rural life. The results show that human activity and lifestyle changes have caused many changes in LULC in the area. Based on the results of this paper, many aspects of rural, agricultural, natural hazard, natural resources and even social studies can be understood in the study Reasons of land use changes are discussed at the end.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that the global stock of soil and environmental resources are diminishing and under threat. This issue stems from current and historical unsustainable management practices, leading to degraded landscapes, which is further compounded by increased pressures upon them from ever-increasing anthropogenic activities. To curb the trajectory toward a collapse of our ecosystems, systematic ways are needed to assess the condition of our natural resources, how much they might have changed, and to what extent this might impact on the life sustaining functions we derive from our environment and the extent of our food producing systems. Some solutions to these issues come in the form of measurement, mapping and monitoring technology, which facilitates powerful ways in which to be informed about and to understand and assess the condition of our landscapes so that they can be managed strategically or simply improved. This Special Issue showcases from several locations across the globe, detailed examples of what is achievable at the convergence of big data brought about by remote and proximal sensing platforms, advanced statistical modelling and computing infrastructure to understand and monitor our ecosystems better. These utilities not only provide high-resolution abilities to map the extent and changes to our food producing systems, they also have yielded new ways to determine land-use and climate effects on the fate of soil carbon across living generations and to identify hydrological risk strategies in otherwise data-poor urban environments. Leveraging the availability of remote sensing data is telling, but the papers in this Special Issue also highlight the sophistication of modelling capabilities to deliver not only highly detailed maps of temporal dynamic soil phenomena but ways to draw new inferences from sparse and disparate model input data. The challenges of restoring our ecosystems are immense and sobering. However, we are well equipped and capable of confronting these pervasive issues in objective and data-informed ways that have previously never been possible.

TI  - Long-term NDVI and recent vegetation cover profiles of major offshore island nesting sites of sea turtles in Saudi waters of the northern Arabian Gulf
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an important ecological component of offshore islands in the Arabian Gulf (AG), which maintains long-term resilience of these islands. This is achieved by influencing sediment retention and moisture acquisition via condensation during periods of high humidity and by providing a variety of microhabitats for island fauna. The resilience of offshore islands' ecosystems in the Saudi waters is important because they host the largest number of nesting hawksbill and green turtles in the AG. This study defines the characteristics and the long-term trends in vegetation cover of the offshore islands used by sea turtles as nesting grounds in the northern AG. To establish a ground-validated baseline for vegetation profiles, a 50 m x 50 m grid system is developed on Karan and Jana islands (Is.) with photo-quadrats taken at each grid intersection. The 1,317 and 444 photo-quadrats, for Karan and Jana Is., respectively, were analyzed for maximum plant height and percent cover of living (green) plants, dead plants, and bare sand. Landsat 7 and 8 satellite top-of-atmosphere reflectance images were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1999 through 2018 to analyze the long-term vegetation profiles of the islands. Monthly rainfall data from five meteorological stations along the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) are presented to provide a context of the long-term NDVI time series variability. The ground-validated vegetation profiles provided baseline data during the onset of summer in 2017 and revealed differences in maximum plant height and the extent of living, dead vegetation and sand cover on Jana Is. (28.3 cm, 19.9%, 63.3%, and 16.8%) and Karan Is. (21.7 cm, 20.6%, 48.7%, and 30.7%), respectively. The NDVI data for both islands are grouped into three periods, namely: 2001-2007 -high winter, low summer; 2008-2013 - low winter, low summer; 2014-2018 - irregular high/low winter, low summer. The long-term trend showed a slightly decreasing NDVI when compared in the context of the high NDVI measured for the two islands during the early 2000 s, particularly during the winter time. An extended reduction in winter NDVI was recorded for six years from 2008 to 2013, which coincided with reduced rainfall in the region and prolonged La Nina. Five extreme dips in winter NDVI values coincided with strong (2000, 2008, and 2011) and moderate (2012 and 2018) La Nina events. Long-term vegetation profiles of the offshore islands seemed to be tightly coupled with long-term rainfall patterns.

TI  - Diagnostically counting palm date trees in Al-Ahssa Governorate of Saudi Arabia: an integrated GIS and remote sensing processing of IKONOS imagery
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability of date palm trees based economy envisages regular monitoring of spatio-temporal variations of these trees over time. But, field based counting is a very old style of managing trees which is labour intensive, costly and time consuming while modern geo-spatial technologies provides a fast, cheaper and accurate mechanism. In this regard, the current study attempts to formulate a repeatable and robust approach utilising high spatial resolution remote sensing data integrated with image processing technique and GIS functionalities in automatically extracting palm trees. The study was carried out over Al-Ahssa region in Saudi Arabia. Difficulties posed by dark and bright canopy situation is resolved in this study based on appropriate kernel (based on multi-scale analysis) along with focal minimum and focal maximum functions, and individual tree locations were identified correctly. Supervised classification technique was utilised to differentiate trees from non-tree areas. The approach has successfully extracted date palm tree locations with an overall accuracy of 93% with an omission error of 5% and commission error of 4%.

TI  - QTL analysis associated to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) involved in the dairy phenotype of Holstein cattle
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS PECUARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim was to identify QTLs associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose action contributes to the productive, reproductive and health phenotypic development of Holstein dairy cattle. 341 QTLs located in 120 genes of the Bos taurus UMD_3.1.1 genome and associated with 189 SNPs with effects on productive (FY, NM, MY, MTCAS, MBLF and PL), reproductive (CONCRATE, DPR, EMBSUR, DAYOPEN and CONCEPT) and health traits (SCC, BTBS and RESRATE) were identified. SNPs were verified in the db SNP-NCBI database, according to which 42 % were located in introns. The Jvenn platform revealed that the SNPs rs135744058, rs110828053 and rs109503725 were common in all three traits. The network of correlations between traits and genes generated by MetScape (Cytoscape 3.4), showed a positive correlation between PL, DPR, DAYOPEN, CONCRATE and CONCEPT, and a negative correlation of FY with PL, NM, DPR and CONCRATE. The functionality of each gene was validated in the Gene-NCBI and UniProt databases, and ClueGo (Cytoscape 3.4) was used to select functional pathways with a significance value less than 0.05, which rendered an intertwining between the development of the mammary gland, the activation of the immune system and the response to steroid hormones evident, the GH gene being the one that directs this functionality. Although the genetic panorama shows that there is an antagonism between productive and reproductive traits, the functional genetic activity due to the 189 SNPs analyzed exhibits an interwoven action in ontological pathways that influence the production processes, as well as in reproductive and health pathways.

TI  - Emerging Adults' Narratives About the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election: An Examination of Meaning-Making Strategies and the Role of Development
T2  - QUALITATIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Because human development is essential to understanding how people make sense of complicated situations, psychologists must consider one's developmental period when thinking about politics. Specifically, during emerging adulthood, people experience major developments regarding identity and worldview construction, which are fundamental to political decision-making. The qualitative study examines the ways in which emerging adults made meaning of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. Through narrative analysis, we identified 7 linguistic strategies that emerging adults used to make meaning of the election: self-positioning, counterfactual thinking, metaphor, perspective shifting, use of contrast, emotion expression, and self-identification. Some emerging adults felt that their beliefs easily aligned with the dominant cultural narrative, but most emerging adults in the sample did not see their beliefs reflected within the dominant cultural narrative, forcing them into deeper negotiation to make meaning of the event; however, regardless of the strategy used or their position in the dominant cultural narrative, all emerging adults in the sample reflected on larger, developmentally appropriate themes, such as worldview construction, social trust, and morality, to reason about the election. Therefore, developmental processes relevant to emerging adulthood were fundamental to the themes emerging adults captured in their narratives and the strategies they used to negotiate meaning.

CP  - 15th Annual Meeting of the Academic-Surgical-Congress (ASC)
CL  - Assoc Acad Surg, Orlando, FL
AB  - Background: Elderly women with clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer (BC) often have comorbidities that limit life expectancy and complicate treatment. We sought to determine whether the number of lymph nodes (LNs) retrieved among older women with node-positive BC was associated with overall survival (OS).Methods: Using the National Cancer Database (2010-2015), women 70-90 y with cN + BC and >= 1 LNs removed were categorized by treatment sequence: upfront surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with restricted cubic splines characterized the functional association of LN retrieval with OS; threshold values of LN retrieval were estimated. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of LN retrieval groups with OS.Results: In the upfront surgery cohort, a nonlinear association was identified between LNs retrieved and OS. In the NAC cohort, no association was identified. For the upfront surgery cohort, the optimal threshold value of LN retrieval was 21 LNs (90% confidence interval 1823). Based on this estimate, LN retrieval groups were created: 6, 6-11, 12-17, 18-23, and 23 LNs. After adjustment, retrieval of <12 LNs in the upfront surgery group was associated with a worse OS. No differences were observed in the NAC group.Conclusions: For elderly women receiving upfront surgery, there is no survival benefit to removing more than 12 LNs, and for those receiving NAC, there is no association between number of LNs removed and survival. In older women who present with cN + BC, aggressive surgery to remove more than 12 LNs may not be necessary. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landsat 9: Empowering open science and applications through continuity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of Earth observation from space is well reflected through the Landsat program. With data collection beginning with Landsat-1 in 1972, the program has evolved technical capabilities while maintaining continuity of land observations. In so doing, Landsat has provided a critical reference for assessing long-term changes to Earth's land environment due to both natural and human forcing. Poised for launch in mid-2021, the joint NASA-USGS Landsat 9 mission will continue this important data record. In many respects Landsat 9 is a clone of Landsat-8. The Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) is largely identical to Landsat 8 OLI, providing calibrated imagery covering the solar reflected wavelengths. The Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) improves upon Landsat 8 TIRS, addressing known issues including stray light incursion and a malfunction of the instrument scene select mirror. In addition, Landsat 9 adds redundancy to TIRS-2, thus upgrading the instrument to a 5-year design life commensurate with other elements of the mission. Initial performance testing of OLI-2 and TIRS-2 indicate that the instruments are of excellent quality and expected to match or improve on Landsat 8 data quality. Landsat-9 will maintain the current data acquisition rate of up to 740 scenes per day, with these scenes available from the Landsat archive at no cost to users. In this communication, we provide background and rationale for the Landsat 9 mission, describe the instrument payloads and ground system, and discuss data products available from the Landsat 9 mission through USGS.

TI  - Analysis of Sentinel Node Biopsy and Clinicopathologic Features as Prognostic Factors in Patients With Atypical Melanocytic Tumors
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Atypical melanocytic tumors (AMTs) include a wide spectrum of melanocytic neoplasms that represent a challenge for clinicians due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis and the related uncertainty about their management. This study analyzed clinicopathologic features and sentinel node status as potential prognostic factors in patients with AMTs. Patients and Methods: Clinicopathologic and follow-up data of 238 children, adolescents, and adults with histologically proved AMTs consecutively treated at 12 European centers from 2000 through 2010 were retrieved from prospectively maintained databases. The binary association between all investigated covariates was studied by evaluating the Spearman correlation coefficients, and the association between progression-free survival and all investigated covariates was evaluated using univariable Cox models. The overall survival and progression-free survival curves were established using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Median follow-up was 126 months (interquartile range, 104-157 months). All patients received an initial diagnostic biopsy followed by wide (1 cm) excision. Sentinel node biopsy was performed in 139 patients (58.4%), 37 (26.6%) of whom had sentinel node positivity. There were 4 local recurrences, 43 regional relapses, and 8 distant metastases as first events. Six patients (2.5%) died of disease progression. Five patients who were sentinel node-negative and 3 patients who were sentinel node-positive developed distant metastases. Ten-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 97% (95% CI, 94.9%-99.2%) and 82.2% (95% CI, 77.3%-87.3%), respectively. Age, mitotic rate/mm2, mitoses at the base of the lesion, lymphovascular invasion, and 9p21 loss were factors affecting prognosis in the whole series and the sentinel node biopsy subgroup. Conclusions: Age >20 years, mitotic rate >4/mm(2), mitoses at the base of the lesion, lymphovascular invasion, and 9p21 loss proved to be worse prognostic factors in patients with ATMs. Sentinel node status was not a clear prognostic predictor.

TI  - Modeling River Discharge Using Automated River Width Measurements Derived from Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the background of a worldwide decrease in the number of gauging stations, the estimation of river discharge using spaceborne data is crucial for hydrological research, river monitoring, and water resource management. Based on the at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) concept, a novel approach is introduced for estimating river discharge using Sentinel-1 time series within an automated workflow. By using a novel decile thresholding method, no a priori knowledge of the AMHG function or proxy is used, as proposed in previous literature. With a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 19.5% for the whole period and a RRMSE of 15.8% considering only dry seasons, our method is a significant improvement relative to the optimized AMHG method, achieving 38.5% and 34.5%, respectively. As the novel approach is embedded into an automated workflow, it enables a global application for river discharge estimation using solely remote sensing data. Starting with the mapping of river reaches, which have large differences in river width over the year, continuous river width time series are created using high-resolution and weather-independent SAR imaging. It is applied on a 28 km long section of the Mekong River near Vientiane, Laos, for the period from 2015 to 2018.

TI  - Prediction of grass biomass from satellite imagery in Somali regional state, eastern Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The drought-prone Ethiopian Somali region has a long history of pastoralism (livestock grazing), which is a major source of livelihoods. However, it suffers from poor rangeland management and a lack of research and information. The objectives of this study were to develop a method for forecasting forage biomass and to quantify production of and spatial variation in forage from satellite imagery. We downloaded Sentinel-2 images and processed spectral information in the blue, red, and near-infrared bands, and calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Combining ground sampling (on 55 plots) with remote sensing data, we developed a forage forecasting model for the area. Forage (biomass) was significantly correlated with both EVI (R-2 = 0.87; P < 0.001) and NDVI (R-2 = 0.81; P < 0.001). Both gave good predictions of forage biomass in the district. We estimated the annual biomass in each grassland pixel at the peak of the growing season. Models based on each index revealed close estimates: NDVI indicated an average of 0.76 t/ ha and a total of 38 772 t/year; EVI indicated an average of 0.78 t/ha and a total of 39 792 t/year. The estimated rangeland biomass showed high spatial variability of 0.22-4.89 t/ha.year. For future rangeland management in the area, the proposed approach and models can be used to estimate available forage biomass from satellite imagery in the middle of the grass growing season (2 months after the rains start), before the grass matures and is harvested.

TI  - A Comparison of UAV and Satellites Multispectral Imagery in Monitoring Onion Crop. An Application in the 'Cipolla Rossa di Tropea' (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy that analyzes the spatial and temporal variability of agricultural fields using information and communication technologies with the aim to optimize profitability, sustainability, and protection of agro-ecological services. In the context of PA, this research evaluated the reliability of multispectral (MS) imagery collected at different spatial resolutions by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 satellite platforms in monitoring onion crops over three different dates. The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was used for monitoring the vigor of the study field. Next, the vigor maps from the two satellite platforms with those derived from UAV were compared by statistical analysis in order to evaluate the contribution made by each platform for monitoring onion crops. Besides, the two coverage's classes of the field, bare soil and onions, were spatially identified using geographical object-based image classification (GEOBIA), and their spectral contribution was analyzed comparing the SAVI calculated considering only crop pixels (i.e., SAVI onions) and that calculated considering only bare soil pixels (i.e., SAVI soil) with the SAVI from the three platforms. The results showed that satellite imagery, coherent and correlated with UAV images, could be useful to assess the general conditions of the field while UAV permits to discriminate localized circumscribed areas that the lowest resolution of satellites missed, where there are conditions of inhomogeneity in the field, determined by abiotic or biotic stresses.

AB  - Nowadays, urban rivers play an important role in city development and make great contributions to urban ecology. Most urban rivers are the drinking water sources and water quality is extremely critical. The current assessment method in national standard of China has multiple limitations; therefore, this paper introduces an advanced assessment, that is, Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI). This method can help to provide comprehensive and objective water quality assessment for the urban rivers. Moreover, CWQI can prevent waste of the water resource, since current assessment is pessimistic and tent to underestimate water samples to a lower grade. Linyi development area is selected as study region and CWQI method is applied to assess two major urban rivers within the area. The water monitoring data from 2014 to 2017 is acquired in 24 parameters. Since the CWQI calculation is still based on traditional water quality measurement in parameters, there will be a huge cost when increasing research scale and accuracy. In this paper, remote sensing technique is employed to develop models of CWQI scores from satellite data. By utilizing 23 selected monitoring instances and matching satellite data, linear regression analysis shows that red band data has highest correlation with CWQI in both two urban rivers in the study region. In addition, two testing datasets with five instances for each river are used to validate the RS-based CWQI models and the results show that testing datasets can be fitted well. With the models, CWQI distribution diagrams are generated and assist both spatial and temporal analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can indicate actual water quality pattern which is validated by field visit. The proposed approach in this paper has satisfying effectiveness and robustness.

TI  - Monitoring Littoral Platform Downwearing Using Differential SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology for the remotely sensed monitoring, measurement and quantification of littoral zone platform downwearing has been developed and is demonstrated, using Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data and analysis. The research area is a 30 km section of coast in East Sussex, UK. This area combines a range of coastal environments and is characterised by the exposure of chalk along the cliffs and coastal platform. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) has been employed, using 3.5 years of Sentinel-1 SAR data. The results demonstrate an average ground level change of -0.36 mm a(-1) across the research area, caused by platform downwearing. Protected sections of coast are downwearing at an average of -0.33 mm a(-1) compared to unprotected sections, which are downwearing more rapidly at an average rate of -1.10 mm a(-1). The material properties of the chalk formations in the platform were considered, and in unprotected areas the weakest chalk types eroded at higher rates (-0.66 mm a(-1)) than the more resistant formations (-0.53 mm a(-1)). At a local scale, results were achieved in three studies to demonstrate variations between urban and rural environments. Individual persistent scatterer point values provided a near-continuous sequence of measurements, which allowed the effects of processes to be evaluated. The results of this investigation show an effective way of retrospective and ongoing monitoring of platform downwearing, erosion and other littoral zone processes, at regional, local and point-specific scales.

TI  - Modeling outdoor thermal comfort using satellite imagery: A principle component analysis-based approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A harmful effect of anthropogenic activities in urban environments is the increases of thermal discomfort and subsequently, a negative effect on humans' mental and physical performance. Therefore, it is of high importance to detect, monitor, and predict thermal discomfort, especially its temporal and spatial patterns in cities. The objective of this study is to propose a new method for modeling outdoor thermal comfort based on remote sensing and climatic datasets. To do so, several datasets were utilized, including those from Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and climatic datasets from local meteorological stations. The method was experimented in the city of Tehran, Iran. For modeling outdoor thermal comfort, the Least Squares Adjustment (LSA) model was presented based on the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). In this model, the Principle Components (PCs) of the environmental and surface biophysical parameters were considered as independent variables and Discomfort Index (DI) as dependent variable. Finally, by determining the optimal values of the adjustment coefficients for each independent variable, maps of outdoor thermal comfort at different timestamps were produced and analyzed. The results of the modeling showed that correlation coefficient and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the modeled and observed outdoor thermal comfort values at the meteorological stations for the training data sets were 0.86 and 1.80, for the testing data set were 0.89 and 2.04, respectively, while it was 0.85 and 1.15 for the self-deployed devices. The average values of DI in warm season of year was 8.5 degrees C higher than the cold season of the year. Further, in both warm and cold seasons of year the mean value of DI for bare land was found higher than other land covers, whereas that of water bodies lower than others. Our findings suggest that efficiency can be achieved for modeling outdoor thermal comfort using LSA with remote sensing and climatic datasets.

TI  - Urban hydrodynamics in the planned township of New Town, West Bengal, India
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable urbanisation has radically deteriorated the natural hydrological phenomena within cityscapes of developing countries. Such neo-urban spaces have inadvertently disrupted the hydrological balance both within and around themselves. As a result, tumultuous `hydro-dynamism' is being faced in atmospheric and sub-surface locales of even small planned neo-urban townships like New Town, West Bengal, wherein rainfall regimes, evapo-transpiration rates(ET), land surface temperatures(LST) and groundwater levels, have been affected. Using Built-up Index to identify the spectacular urban growth, TRMM rainfall data, MODIS 11B3 LST and MODIS 16A2 ET rates have been further correlated 3 dimensionally as well as statistically, to understand the changing hydrological regime of the township for two time periods, i.e., 2001-02 and 2018-19. The variables were found to be significantly related, and partial aggressors for average piezometric fall. Results from average annual estimates depict that over the past 18 years of urban growth of New Town, rainfall has decreased by 10 mm(112 mm), LST has increased by 5 units(300 Celsius), while ET values have decreased by 3units(5 mm/year). Groundwater level data acquired from the Central Groundwater Board Reports, further state that other than groundwater over-extraction by the denizens, there is a 13% chance that the 4-6 mbgl fall may be attributed to the changing urban hydrology. Future predictions using annual average data state that rainfall will decrease to 102 mm, while LST might escalate to around 35-37 and 29-300 Celsius during day-time and night-time, respectively. Piezometric fall and ET rates will plummet to around 20-30mbgl and 2-0.8 mm/year, respectively, causing undue stress to neighbouring zones.

TI  - Integrative assessment of the biological responses elicited by metal pollution in the green garden snail, <i>Cantareus apertus</i>: Laboratory and field studies
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sets of multiple biomarkers can be applied to achieve a comprehensive assessment of the biological impact of the chemical pollutants in contaminated soils. This approach requires the integration of diverse biomarker data into indices that provide early signs of ecosystem health disturbance. Within this context, this study aims at in-tegrating multiple biomarkers in green garden snail, Cantareus apertus, on the basis of data obtained in preceding laboratory and field studies. In the laboratory, snails had been treated with dietary Pb, Cd and their mixture. Prompt (1 wk) and long-lasting (8 wk) response profiles were characterized and the biomarkers integrated as Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR/n) index. The response profiles were dose and treatment time dependent in quantitative terms and also qualitatively different along the treatment time. Yet, IBR/n was sensitive to provide early (1 wk) signs of health disturbance caused by the metals, and remained sensitive in the long term (8 wk). In the field study, soil metal pollution was investigated along a distance gradient from a main roadside. Both metal levels in the soil-plant-snail system and a set of biomarkers in snails were recorded. The IBR/n revealed that disturbance in soil ecosystem health was restricted to short distances (at 20 m but not at 150 m). Therefore, IBR/ n was a suitable approach also in the complexity of the field. Moreover, together with the IBR/n index, recently developed indices of bioavailability (SET) and risk (ERITME) were applied in the field study. In accordance with the IBR/n index, the SET index also revealed an excess transfer of metals to snails limited to a short distance from the roadside and identified Cd as the priority target for soil pollution management. Likewise, the ERITME classification rank confirmed that environmental risk was the highest at 20 m away from the roadside and then decreased at 150 m and beyond. Therefore, the application of the IBR/n index together with existing indices of the bioavailability (excess transfer) and risk of contaminants represents a challenging approach for the in-tegrated environmental risk assessment of contaminated soils.

TI  - Towards a PS-InSAR Based Prediction Model for Building Collapse: Spatiotemporal Patterns of Vertical Surface Motion in Collapsed Building Areas-Case Study of Alexandria, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Buildings are vulnerable to collapse incidents. We adopt a workflow to detect unusual vertical surface motions before building collapses based on PS-InSAR time series analysis and spatiotemporal data mining techniques. Sentinel-1 ascending and descending data are integrated to decompose vertical deformation in the city of Alexandria, Egypt. Collapsed building data were collected from official sources, and overlayed on PS-InSAR vertical deformation results. Time series deformation residuals are used to create a space-time cube in the ArcGIS software environment and analyzed by emerging hot spot analysis to extract spatiotemporal patterns for vertical deformation around collapsed buildings. Our results show two spatiotemporal patterns of new cold spot or new hot spot before the incidents in 66 out of 68 collapsed buildings between May 2015 and December 2018. The method was validated in detail on four collapsed buildings between January and May 2019, proving the applicability of this workflow to create a temporal vulnerability map for building collapse monitoring. This study is a step forward to create a PS-InSAR based model for building collapse prediction in the city.

TI  - Flood management in India: A focussed review on the current status and future challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite massive investments and continuous flood-control efforts in India, the socio-economic damages and death toll continue to remain high. Undoubtedly, the process of flood management in India is very complex due to the influence of several socio-hydroclimatological factors, such as climate change, sea level rise, and socioeconomic dynamics. While these factors influence the intensity and frequency of flood events, factors explicitly related to the process of flood management, such as the improper execution of traditional structural measures, the lack of the proper implementation of schemes, lackadaisical execution of traditional structural measures and end-to-end management of the flood management programs/practices, ensure only partial protection. This review article identifies the region-specific flood problems in India and discusses the initiatives undertaken by major Indian flood management agencies, with an emphasis on the current ongoing flood management practices. The effectiveness of these practices in the long term is discussed, and specific gaps are identified. The recommendations provided in this article may be useful to guide stakeholders and policymakers in formulating and implementing sustainable flood management plans for improved flood resilience.

TI  - Influence of the Statistical Properties of Phase and Intensity on Closure Phase
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonzero closure phase exists in multilooked pixels. We study the influence of the statistical properties of the intensity and phase changes of single-looked pixels on multilooked phase and coherence. By quantifying the extent of their influences on phase triplet, we show in this article that the statistical properties of the intensity of pixels within a multilooking window can induce changes in interferometric phase and coherence, and contribute to the nonzero closure phase. We demonstrate that the intensity-induced changes increase by increasing the standard deviation of the phase changes, dispersion index of intensity, and the correlation between the intensity and phase changes. We have used ALOS Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, and Sentinel-1 images to generate real and semisynthetic interferograms to assess our findings. The semisynthetic interferograms are produced by pairing real SAR data and synthetic SAR data; the synthetic SAR data are generated from the real data by adding random vectors with predefined average changes of phase and intensity. Our results show that closure phase is only a function of the statistical properties of the phase and intensity of pixels, and does not possess the information about the magnitude of physical changes. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of methods that exploit phase triplet as a means to estimate soil moisture or any other deforming or nondeforming changes.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variation of the Urban Heat Island in Santiago, Chile during Summers 2005-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) can present significant risks to human health. Santiago, Chile has around 7 million residents, concentrated in an average density of 480 people/km(2). During the last few summer seasons, the highest extreme maximum temperatures in over 100 years have been recorded. Given the projections in temperature increase for this metropolitan region over the next 50 years, the Santiago UHI could have an important impact on the health and stress of the general population. We studied the presence and spatial variability of UHIs in Santiago during the summer seasons from 2005 to 2017 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery and data from nine meteorological stations. Simple regression models, geographic weighted regression (GWR) models and geostatistical interpolations were used to find nocturnal thermal differences in UHIs of up to 9 degrees C, as well as increases in the magnitude and extension of the daytime heat island from summer 2014 to 2017. Understanding the behavior of the UHI of Santiago, Chile, is important for urban planners and local decision makers. Additionally, understanding the spatial pattern of the UHI could improve knowledge about how urban areas experience and could mitigate climate change.

TI  - A Global Archive of Coseismic DInSAR Products Obtained Through Unsupervised Sentinel-1 Data Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an automatic and unsupervised tool for the systematic generation of Sentinel-1 (S1) differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) coseismic products. In particular, the tool first retrieves the location, depth, and magnitude of every seismic event from interoperable online earthquake catalogs (e.g., the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and then, for significant (with respect to a set of selected thresholds) earthquakes, it automatically triggers the downloading of S1 data and their interferometric processing over the area affected by the earthquake. The automatic system we developed has also been implemented within a Cloud-Computing (CC) environment, specifically the Amazon Web Services, with the aim of creating a global database of DInSAR S1 coseismic products, which consist of displacement maps and the associated wrapped interferograms and spatial coherences. This information will progressively be made freely available through the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) Research Infrastructure, thus providing the scientific community with a large catalog of DInSAR data that can be helpful for investigating the dynamics of surface deformation in the seismic zones around the Earth. The developed tool can also support national and local authorities during seismic crises by quickly providing information on the surface deformation induced by earthquakes.

TI  - Locoregional Lymph Node Recurrence of Trunk Melanoma in Non-sentinel Lymph Node Basins: An Observational Retrospective Study
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Locoregional lymph node recurrences of primary trunk melanoma can occur in basins not identified during sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, the factors associated with recurrences in non-sentinel lymph node basins are unknown. To evaluate these factors, this observational retrospective study examined the patterns of first lymph node recurrence and the factors associated with recurrence in non-sentinel lymph node basins. A total of 305 patients with primary trunk melanoma who had undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy from 2000 to 2015 were evaluated. Twenty-three patients presented locoregional lymph node recurrence; 8 of which (34.8%) were in non-sentinel lymph node basins. Non-sentinel lymph node recurrences were more frequent in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes and in those patients whose number of tumour-involved nodes was > 3. These results suggest that clinical examination and ultrasound surveillance should be performed on all potential lymph node drainage basins of trunk melanomas.

TI  - Assessment of Leaf Area Index Models Using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance Data over a Semi-Arid Irrigated Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an essential indicator of crop development and growth. For many agricultural applications, satellite-based LAI estimates at the farm-level often require near-daily imagery at medium to high spatial resolution. The combination of data from different ongoing satellite missions, Sentinel 2 (ESA) and Landsat 8 (NASA), provides this opportunity. In this study, we evaluated the leaf area index generated from three methods, namely, existing vegetation index (VI) relationships applied to Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) surface reflectance produced by NASA, the SNAP biophysical model, and the THEIA L2A surface reflectance products from Sentinel-2. The intercomparison was conducted over the agricultural scheme in Bekaa (Lebanon) using a large set of in-field LAIs and other biophysical measurements collected in a wide variety of canopy structures during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The major studied crops include herbs (e.g., cannabis: Cannabis sativa, mint: Mentha, and others), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and vegetables (e.g., bean: Phaseolus vulgaris, cabbage: Brassica oleracea, carrot: Daucus carota subsp. sativus, and others). Additionally, crop-specific height and above-ground biomass relationships with LAIs were investigated. Results show that of the empirical VI relationships tested, the EVI2-based HLS models statistically performed the best, specifically, the LAI models originally developed for wheat (RMSE:1.27), maize (RMSE:1.34), and row crops (RMSE:1.38). LAI derived through European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) biophysical processor underestimated LAI and provided less accurate estimates (RMSE of 1.72). Additionally, the S2 SeLI LAI algorithm (from SNAP biophysical processor) produced an acceptable accuracy level compared to HLS-EVI2 models (RMSE of 1.38) but with significant underestimation at high LAI values. Our findings show that the LAI-VI relationship, in general, is crop-specific with both linear and non-linear regression forms. Among the examined indices, EVI2 outperformed other vegetation indices when all crops were combined, and therefore it can be identified as an index that is best suited for a unified algorithm for crops in semi-arid irrigated regions with heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the observed height-LAI relationship is crop-specific and essentially linear with an R-2 value of 0.82 for potato, 0.79 for wheat, and 0.50 for both cannabis and tobacco. The ability of the linear regression to estimate the fresh and dry above-ground biomass of potato from both observed height and LAI was reasonable, yielding R-2: similar to 0.60.

TI  - Soil Salinity Assessment in Irrigated Paddy Fields of the Niger Valley Using a Four-Year Time Series of Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization is a major soil degradation threat in irrigated systems worldwide. Irrigated systems in the Niger River basin are also affected by salinity, but its spatial distribution and intensity are not currently known. The aim of this study was to develop a method to detect salt-affected soils in irrigated systems. Two complementary approaches were tested: salinity assessment of bare soils using a salinity index (SI) and monitoring of indirect effects of salinity on rice growth using temporal series of a vegetation index (NDVI). The study area was located south of Niamey (Niger) in two irrigated systems of rice paddy fields that cover 6.5 km(2). We used remote-sensing and ground-truth data to relate vegetation behavior and reflectance to soil characteristics. We explored all existing Sentinel-2 images from January 2016 to December 2019 and selected cloud-free images on 157 dates that covered eight successive rice-growing seasons. In the dry season of 2019, we also sampled 44 rice fields, collecting 147 biomass samples and 180 topsoil samples from January to June. For each field and growing season, time-integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI) was estimated, and the SI was calculated for dates on which bare soil conditions (NDVI < 0.21) prevailed. Results showed that since there were few periods of bare soil, SI could not differentiate salinity classes. In contrast, the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 images enabled us to describe rice-growing conditions over time. In 2019, TI-NDVI and crop yields were strongly correlated (r = 0.77 with total biomass yield and 0.82 with grain yield), while soil electrical conductivity was negatively correlated with both TI-NDVI (r = -0.38) and crop yield (r = -0.23 with total biomass and r = -0.29 with grain yield). Considering the TI-NDVI data from 2016-2019, principal component analysis followed by ascending hierarchical classification identified a typology of five clusters with different patterns of TI-NDVI during the eight growing seasons. When applied to the entire study area, this classification clearly identified the extreme classes (i.e., areas with high or no salinity). Other classes with low TI-NDVI (i.e., during dry seasons) may be related to areas with moderate or seasonal soil salinity. Finally, the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 images enabled us to detect stresses on vegetation that occurred repeatedly over the growing seasons, which may be good indicators of soil constraints due to salinity in the context of the irrigated paddy systems of Niger. Further research will validate the ability of the method developed to detect moderate soil salinity constraints over large areas.

TI  - Traveller exposures to animals: a GeoSentinel analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Human coexistence with other animals can result in both intentional and unintentional contact with a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian species. International travellers are at riskfor such encounters; travellers risk injury, infection and possibly death from domestic and wild animal bites, scratches, licks and other exposures. The aim of the present analysis was to understand the diversity and distribution of animal-related exposures among international travellers.Methods: Data from January 2007 through December 2018 from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network were reviewed. Records were included if the exposure was non-migration travel with a diagnosis of an animal (dog, cat, monkey, snake or other) bite or other exposure (non-bite); records were excluded if the region of exposure was not ascertainable or if another, unrelated acute diagnosis was reported.Results: A total of 6470 animal exposures (bite or non-bite) were included. The majority (71%) occurred in Asia. Travellers to 167 countries had at least one report of an animal bite or non-bite exposure. The majority (76%) involved dogs, monkeys and cats, although a wide range of wild and domestic species were involved. Almost two-thirds (62.6%) of 4395 travellers with information available did not report a pretravel consultation with a healthcare provider.Conclusions: Minimizing bites and other animal exposures requires education (particularly during pretravel consultations) and behavioral modification. These should be supplemented by the use of pre-exposure rabies vaccination for travellers to high-risk countries (especially to those with limited access to rabies immunoglobulin), as well as encouragement of timely (in-country) post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies and Macacine alphaherpesvirus 1 (herpesvirus B) when warranted.

TI  - Pattern and Trend of Land Surface Temperature Change on New Guinea Island
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming will have an impact on nature in many ways, including rising sea levels and an increasing spread of infectious diseases. Land surface temperature is one of the many indicators that can be used to measure climate change on both a local and global scale. This study aims to analyze the change in land surface temperatures on New Guinea Island using a cubic spline method, autoregressive model, and multivariate regression. New Guinea Island was divided into 5 regions each consisting of 9 subregions. The data of each subregion was obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer database from 2000 to 2019. The average change in temperature was +0.012 degrees C per decade. However, the changes differed by region; significantly decreasing in the northwest at -0.107 degrees C per decade (95% CI: -0.207, -0.007), significantly increasing in the south at 0.201 degrees C per decade (95% CI: 0.069, 0.333), and remaining stable in the centralnorth, southeast and northeast.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The water present in the subsurface is considered as a high treasured water source. The present study deals with the delineation of groundwater potential zone in Tirunelveli Taluk, Tamil Nadu, South India. The study area lies between longitude 77 degrees 32 ' 16 '' to 77 degrees 48 ' 8 '' E and latitude 8 degrees 40 ' 12 '' to 8 degrees 56 ' 34 '' N with an area of 558.42 km(2). The groundwater potential zone of the Tirunelveli Taluk was inferred by the following layers, namely geology, geomorphology, lineament density, drainage density, rainfall, slope, soil and land use/land cover. These layers are digitized with the scale of 1:50,000 in GIS environment from the spatial data sources such as SOI topographic maps, GSI geology map, LANDSAT 8 satellite image, SRTM DEM, Tamil Nadu Agricultural Department daily rainfall data and available existing maps. The weights of the feature layers and ranking of each feature classes arrive from the pairwise comparison techniques of AHP technique. The prepared thematic maps are reclassified based on the influence of the layers feature classes on the groundwater availability. Finally, the reclassified layers are overlaid using weighted overlay tool to prepare groundwater prospect map. The finally this study resulted that 5.76 km(2)of the study area is identified as very high groundwater potential. The high potential area covers 382.9 km(2), and medium potential zone covers 169.72 km(2).

TI  - Effect of the Application of Temporal Mask Map on the Relationship between NDVI and Rice Yield
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a temporal mask map using MCD12Q1 data, and (2) to extract the annual variations in paddy, (3) to investigate the correlation analysis between MYD13Q1 NDVI and rice yield, and (4) to review its applicability. For these purposes, the temporal mask map was created using annual MCD12Q1 PFT data from 2002 to 2019, and compared with the fixed mask map. As a result, it found that the temporal mask map well reflected the variations of the paddy area. In addition, the correlation coefficient between NDVI and rice yield was also high significant as compared to the fixed mask map. Therefore, the temporal mask map will be useful for NDVI extraction, crop monitoring, and estimation of rice yield.

TI  - A Hybrid Data Balancing Method for Classification of Imbalanced Training Data within Google Earth Engine: Case Studies from Mountainous Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Distribution of Land Cover (LC) classes is mostly imbalanced with some majority LC classes dominating against minority classes in mountainous areas. Although standard Machine Learning (ML) classifiers can achieve high accuracies for majority classes, they largely fail to provide reasonable accuracies for minority classes. This is mainly due to the class imbalance problem. In this study, a hybrid data balancing method, called the Partial Random Over-Sampling and Random Under-Sampling (PROSRUS), was proposed to resolve the class imbalance issue. Unlike most data balancing techniques which seek to fully balance datasets, PROSRUS uses a partial balancing approach with hundreds of fractions for majority and minority classes to balance datasets. For this, time-series of Landsat-8 and SRTM topographic data along with various spectral indices and topographic data were used over three mountainous sites within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. It was observed that PROSRUS had better performance than several other balancing methods and increased the accuracy of minority classes without a reduction in overall classification accuracy. Furthermore, adopting complementary information, particularly topographic data, considerably increased the accuracy of minority classes in mountainous areas. Finally, the obtained results from PROSRUS indicated that every imbalanced dataset requires a specific fraction(s) for addressing the class imbalance problem, because different datasets contain various characteristics.

TI  - Quantitative modeling of cyanobacterial concentration using MODIS imagery in the Southern Caspian Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms have been observed, over the last decade, in several regions of the southern Caspian Sea, becoming a major threat to human health and aquatic life. The present study aims to develop two models to quantify cyanobacterial concentration in the Caspian Sea using artificial neural networks and multiple band linear regression. The models are based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. Data were collected from the west, center, and east of the southern Caspian Sea between September 2015 and August 2016. The field dataset includes 123 samples in seven different transects and is used to define and evaluate the proposed methods. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (URMSE), and correlation coefficient (R) values between Multiple Band Linear Regression Algorithm outputs and field dataset are 1.8 x 10(-3) mg.m(-3), 22.43%, and 0.73, respectively. For Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the outputs are 1.6 x 10(-3) mg.m(-3), 18.89%, and 0.81, respectively. The performance of the proposed methods is proven suitable under nearly all conditions of the southern Caspian Sea. However, numerical comparison and visual evaluation of the results show that the ANN method is less sensitive to small changes in the environmental conditions, leading to more stable results. Moreover, the ANN model provides accurate results in most cases, and the accuracy of this results are improved by increasing the training data. This study focused on the development and validation of an optimal algorithm for quantifying temporal and spatial variability phycocyanin concentrations in the Caspian Sea using daily satellite data.

TI  - Development of high spatial resolution weather data using daily meteorological observations over Indian region
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Finer spatial resolution interpolated weather data is essential to enable utilization of satellite-based images in studies related to crop growth dynamics, etc. Satellite data are available daily at 1 x 1 km or at the most within 5 x 5 km grid. To make the weather data timely available at the same spatial scale, the procedure has been developed to generate the spatially interpolated weather data product over India. Daily weather data (minimum & maximum temperature and rainfall) available at point scale on India Meteorology Department web site have been used in this study. A semi-automated user interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed which quality checks the temperature data sets by filling the missing data sets as well as providing a platform to correct erroneous data which have been identified using statistical methods taking spatial as well as temporal incompatibility into account. Daily spatially interpolated product is generated in image form using thin plate spline interpolation technique that uses the quality checked weather data as well as elevation information from CARTODEM data in order to account for effect of elevation on temperature. The validation was performed using "Jack-knife testing method" for three different seasons i.e., monsoon, summer and winter. The mean absolute errors for decadal averaged products were found to vary within 1.2-1.5 degrees C for maximum temperature, 1.1-1.7 degrees C for minimum temperature, 1.0-7.0 mm for rainfall considering all seasons with higher error observed in monsoon for maximum temperature and rainfall and in winter for minimum temperature. It was found that errors were close to 1 degrees C for stations with elevation less than 550 m whereas in central portion of India, mean absolute errors were found to be less than 1 degrees C.

TI  - Dust concentration over a semi-arid region: Parametric study and establishment of new empirical models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the city of Tehran, Iran's capital, has encountered numerous dust events so that the dust concentration of PM10, has reached even more than 800 mu g m(-3). This emphasizes the importance of the statistical study of dust in Tehran and the development of correlations for estimating dust concentration of PM10. In the present study, by evaluating the data measured during dust observations over the years 2013-2016 in Tehran, new statistical models are established for estimating PM10, concentration in terms of horizontal visibility and MODIS AOD. Firstly, simple nonlinear regression models between dust concentration of PM10, and horizontal visibility as well as MODIS AOD are developed. Afterward, by combining the mentioned parameters with meteorological measurements, including wind speed, relative humidity, and temperature, multivariate nonlinear regression models are obtained. The descriptive statistical parameters and Taylor diagram concept are used in order to compare the performance of various models. Analyzing the developed models indicates that the simple model based on horizontal visibility has the best performance (R = 0.90) and considering meteorological parameters does not have a significant positive impact on the model performance. Furthermore, the estimated dust concentration of PM10, using simple models developed in this study has a better correlation with the measurements in Tehran in comparison with the results obtained by models of other researchers. This demonstrates the importance of developing such models according to the climatic and geological conditions of the investigated region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nakamura, FY, Antunes, P, Nunes, C, Costa, JA, Esco, MR, and Travassos, B. Heart rate variability changes from traditional vs. ultra-short-term recordings in relation to preseason training load and performance in futsal players.J Strength Cond Res34(10): 2974-2981, 2020-The aims of this study were to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) changes in futsal players during preseason training using both "criterion" (10-minute) and ultra-shortened (2-minute) measures, and to determine whether they were related to changes in the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test, level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) performance and accumulated training load (TL). Eleven male competitive futsal players (age = 25.19 +/- 4.70 years; body mass = 73.15 +/- 11.70 kg; and height = 176.90 +/- 5.01 cm) volunteered for the study. Data collection took place during the first to the fourth weeks of preseason training. Training load was monitored with session ratings of perceived exertion. The total distance (TD) covered during the Yo-Yo IR1 was recorded during week 1 and week 4. Heart rate variability was measured through the log-transformed root mean square of successive normal-to-normal interval differences using the ultra-short analysis, with its weekly mean (lnRMSSD(M)) and coefficient of variation (lnRMSSD(CV)) recorded, and by means of the criterion method (weeks 1 and 4). lnRMSSD(M)was likely higher at week 4 compared with week 1 using both criterion and ultra-short recordings. Moderate-to-large correlations were found between changes in the lnRMSSD(M)and lnRMSSD(CV)values and changes in TL and TD (rvalues ranged from -0.48 to 0.65). Changes in ultra-short HRV measures (i.e., increase in lnRMSSD(M)and decrease in lnRMSSD(CV)) during futsal preseason were associated with increased performance. The players who accumulated higher perceived TLs displayed smaller improvements in the Yo-Yo IR1 performance and HRV.

TI  - Dynamics of phytoplankton species composition, biomass and nutrients in the North Atlantic during spring and summer - A trans-Atlantic study
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - During a return trip in May-June 2013 from Bergen, Norway, to Nuuk, Greenland, on the Institute of Marine Research's R/V "G. O. Sars", four ocean basins, the Norwegian, Iceland, Irminger and Labrador seas, were surveyed twice. Here we analyse the phytoplankton communities and their dynamics in the four basins, winter nutrient content, potential for new production, consumption of nutrients, phenology and algae biomass (Chlo-rophyll a). The primary production dynamics of the four basins are compared and related to physical forcing and top-down control and discussed in relation to vertical carbon flux. We focus on the primary production dynamics in the central, mostly Atlantic, water masses of the basin-wide gyres. The survey results are put into a larger scale context by comparison with MODIS surface chlorophyll estimates.The timing of the phytoplankton bloom phase differed among the basins. In the Labrador Sea, there was a strong bloom already occurring during the first crossing in mid-May. This was confirmed by nitrate and silicate reduction, which was much larger in the Labrador Sea compared to the other seas in May. In the Irminger Sea the bloom lagged behind, whereas in the Norwegian and Iceland seas both a pre-bloom and a late bloom were observed during May-June.There was a direct relationship between the mixed layer depth and the use of nitrate at the sampling stations, and a direct relationship between chlorophyll concentrations and the use of nitrate. The two relationships suggest that the use of nitrate can serve as a measure of the developmental state of the phytoplankton bloom, phenology, and that it is related to the shallowing of the mixed layer.Flagellates were the most abundant algae in all regions, outnumbered by diatoms only at a couple of stations west of Greenland. Elevated ciliate numbers were observed in the Iceland and Norwegian seas on both sides of the Arctic front. The algae outnumbered the microzooplankton by at least an order of magnitude.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 103rd Annual Clinical Congress of the American-College-of-Surgeons (ACS) / Surgical Education Forum
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Background: Clinical trials have long established the long-term safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in patients with clinically node-negative early stage breast cancer. The variations in utilization of SLND and ALND in this patient population, however, are currently unknown.Methods: Adult female patients (40 years and older) within the National Cancer Database diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2013 and December 2015, who had clinical T1-T2 and N0 disease, and who underwent either SLND (with or without subsequent ALND) or ALND were included. Differences in utilization across race, ethnicity, insurance type, facility, and residential characteristics were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.Results: Overall, 271,689 patients were included, of which 26,527 (10%) received ALND and 245,162 (90%) underwent SLND. After adjusting for demographics and cancer characteristics, black (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-1.17) and Hispanic women (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.24) were more likely to receive ALND. Patients without health insurance (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19-1.47), compared with private health insurance, and those receiving treatment at community cancer centers (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.53-1.67), compared with academic/research centers, were also more likely to receive ALND.Conclusions: Although the vast majority of women undergo SLND, significant disparities exist in its utilization for early stage breast cancer, with traditionally underserved patients receiving unwarranted extensive axillary surgery. Increased patient and surgeon education is needed to decrease variations in care that can affect patient's quality of life. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Application of Satellite Remote Sensing in Monitoring Elevated Internal Temperatures of Landfills
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface fires and smoldering events at landfills can present serious health hazards and threats to the environment. These fires are much more costly and difficult to extinguish than open fires at the landfill surface. The initiation of a subsurface fire may go unnoticed for a long period of time and undetected fires may spread over a large area. Unfortunately, not all landfill operators keep or publish heat elevation data and many landfills are not equipped with a landfill gas extraction system to control subsurface temperatures generated from the chemical reactions within. The timely and cost-effective identification of subsurface fires is an important and pressing issue. In this work, we describe a method for using satellite thermal infrared imagery at a moderate spatial resolution to identify the locations of subsurface fires and monitor their migration within landfills. The focus of this study was the Bridgeton Sanitary Landfill in Bridgeton, MO, USA where a subsurface fire was first identified in 2010 and continues to burn today. Observations from Landsat satellites over the last seventeen years were examined for surface temperature anomalies (or hot spots) that may be associated with subsurface fires. The results showed that the locations of hot spots identified in satellite imagery match the known locations of the subsurface fires. Changes in the hot-spot locations with time, as determined by in situ measurements, correspond to the spreading routes of the subsurface fires. These results indicate that the proposed approach based on satellite observations can be used as a tool for the identification of landfill subsurface fires by landfill owners/operators to monitor landfills and minimize the expenses associated with extinguishing landfill fires.

TI  - Influence of global climate on freshwater changes in Africa's largest endorheic basin using multi-scaled indicators
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The poor investments in gauge measurements for hydro-climatic research in Africa has necessitated the need to investigate how decision makers can leverage on sophisticated space-borne measurements to improve knowledge on surface water hydrology that can feed directly into water accounting processes, and risk assessment from extreme droughts and its impacts. To demonstrate such potential, a suite of satellite earth observations (Sentinel-2, altimetry, Landsat, GRACE, and TRMM) and model data are combined with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index to assess the impacts of global climate on freshwater dynamics over the LCD (Lake Chad basin), Africa's largest endorheic basin. As shown in the results of this study, the significant relationship of climate modes (AMO; r=0.68 and 059; and AMM; r=0.42 and 0.47) with drought patterns in the LCB highlights the evidence of global climate influence in the region. The significant declines in drought extents and their intensities (2004 - 2015) over LCB coincide with the rise in surface water extent of the Lake Chad during the same period. Change detection analysis of open water features in the southern pool of Lake Chad during the 2015 - 2019 period shows that on the average, only 28.4% of inundated areas within the vicinity of the Lake persisted during the period. While the association of terrestrial water storage (TWS) with model-derived surface water storage (SWS) is strongest (r=0.89) in the catchments that provide the most nourishment to the Lake Chad, the relationship of rainfall (2002 - 2017) with TWS (r=0.85), model TWS (r=0.87) and SWS (r=0.88) confirm that the LCB's hydrology is predominantly climate-driven. This notion is further reinforced as the predicted SWS over the LCB using a support vector machine regression scheme was found to be strongly correlated (r=0.95 at alpha=0.05) with observed SWS.

TI  - Mitigation of Arctic Tundra Surface Warming by Plant Evapotranspiration: Complete Energy Balance Component Estimation Using LANDSAT Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change is expected to cause a strong temperature increase in the polar regions, accompanied by a reduction in snow cover. Due to a lower albedo, bare ground absorbs more solar energy and its temperature can increase more. Here, we show that vegetation growth in such bare ground areas can efficiently mitigate surface warming in the Arctic, thanks to plant evapotranspiration. In order to establish a comprehensive energy balance for the Arctic land surface, we used an ensemble of methods of ground-based measurements and multispectral satellite image analysis. Our estimate is that the low vegetation of polar tundra transforms 26% more solar energy into evapotranspiration than bare ground in clear sky weather. Due to its isolation properties, vegetation further reduces ground heat flux under the surface by similar to 4%, compared to bare areas, thus lowering the increase in subsurface temperature. As a result, similar to 22% less solar energy can be transformed into sensible heat flux at vegetated surfaces as opposed to bare ground, bringing about a decrease in surface temperature of similar to 7.8 degrees C.

TI  - The use of LiDAR versus unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to assess rooftop solar energy potential
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data provide many opportunities for enhancing our understanding of the built and natural environment. Representations of the urban landscape from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors and digital orthophotography from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are quickly becoming essential for examining and maintaining infrastructure systems, estimating risk from extreme events, and improving urban sustainability. This includes community efforts toward energy resilience and the development of alternative energy systems, such as solar and wind. While LiDAR provides the means to model key characteristics of the urban landscape for solar energy planning, including slope, aspect and elevation, issues of spatial uncertainty and error persist in LiDAR data and have the potential to reduce the fidelity of solar energy assessments. In this paper, we use extremely high-resolution UAS data to improve solar energy audits and mitigate uncertainties associated with LiDAR data. The results suggest improvements in aggregate irradiation estimates by as much as 36 % when using digital orthophotos from a UAS when compared to LiDAR. This paper concludes with a detailed discussion of potential strategies for improving solar energy estimates for both researchers and practitioners.

TI  - Is It Helpful to Believe That Efforts Will Lead to Positive Outcomes? Two Cross-Lagged Panel Investigations among Adolescents and Young Adults
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, the role of self-views in life satisfaction has been extensively investigated. Recently, growing attention has been directed to the question of whether an optimistic worldview, termed "reward for application", helps boost life satisfaction. Conceptually, the association between reward for application and life satisfaction can be paradoxical. Due to various methodological and theoretical shortfalls, previous investigations were unable to draw a robust conclusion on this association. To address these shortfalls, two cross-lagged panel studies were conducted with different time lags. Over and above the potential confounds of self-views (namely, self-esteem and self-rated personality traits), reward for application had a positive effect on lagged life satisfaction among both adolescents and young adults, while the reverse effect was not found. Moreover, we found support for the multiplicative effect between worldviews and self-views, in which the positive effect of reward for application on life satisfaction was attenuated by high self-esteem.

TI  - Advances in the estimation of high Spatio-temporal resolution pan-African top-down biomass burning emissions made using geostationary fire radiative power (FRP) and MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide major updates to the 'top down' Fire Radiative Energy Emissions (FREM) approach to biomass burning emissions calculations, bypassing the estimation of fuel consumption that is a major source of uncertainty in widely used 'bottom up' approaches. The FREM approach links satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to emission rates of total particulate matter (TPM) via spatially varying smoke emissions coefficients (g.MJ(-1)) - each derived from matchups of FRP and smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD). In the original FREMv1 approach, FRP data came from the geostationary Meteosat satellite and AOD data from the 10 km spatial resolution MODIS MOD04 aerosol product. However, the latter often performs quite poorly close to biomass burning sources due to its large 10 km pixels, bias at high MODIS view zenith angles, and saturation and/or removal of areas of high AOD limitations introducing bias and uncertainty into the final FREM-derived smoke emissions estimates. We address each of these issues through a series of significant methodological and input data improvements, including exploitation of the 1 km MODIS MAIAC AOD product that performs far better close to fire sources. We use our FREMv2 methodology to generate a new pan-African fire emissions inventory for TPM and the carbonaceous gases CO2, CO and CH4, and our annual mean TPM emissions are within 11% of those of the MODIS-based FEER top-down approach, but significantly higher than those of GFASv1.2 and GFEDv4.1s (by 114% and 69% respectively) agreeing with independent assessments that aerosol emissions of GFASv1.2 require upscaling by a factor of 2 to 3.4 to deliver matching magnitudes between modelled and observed AODs. From our carbonaceous emissions totals we map dry matter consumed (DMC) across Africa, and dividing this by the FireCCISFD11 20 m burned area product we provide one of the first data-driven pan-African maps of fuel consumption per unit area (kg.m(-2)) which in many areas is higher than in GFEDv4.1s. Our estimates represent the highest spatio-temporal resolution biomass burning emissions data yet available over Africa, and significantly advance the aim of a pan-tropical and mid-latitude inventory based on FRP from the global geostationary satellite network (Meteosat, Meteosat IOD, GOES and Himawari).

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Scene Classification Using Multiview Cross Correlation Attention Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The second-order pooling manner, exploring higher feature statistics than the first-order pooling, has achieved impressive performance in scene classification. However, the object not only presents similarity but also exhibits diversified singularity on the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. These make the second-order pooling approaches to explore the single-view second-order feature statistics less adaptable for SAR scene classification. To solve this issue, an end-to-end training framework based on the multiview cross correlation attention network (MCAN) is proposed. The spatial and channelwise self-attention modules are first employed to model the interdependences between the spatial and channel dimensions of their convolutional features. Subsequently, the global spatial and channelwise covariance pooling layers are drawn into the MCAN, and then, they learn the spatial and channel cross correlations within the feature statistics, respectively. Finally, an iterative matrix square-root normalization layer, which owns the capability to fast computing approximate square root of the covariance matrix, is introduced for making the feature representation more discriminative. Experiments on the SAR data set from the TerraSAR-X images for scene classification demonstrate that the MCAN performs better than other related works.

TI  - Travel-related hepatitis E: a two-decade GeoSentinel analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is widely distributed worldwide and is endemic in developing countries. Travel-related HEV infection has been reported at national levels, but global data are missing. Moreover, the global availability of HEV diagnostic testing has not been explored so far. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of HEV infections in returning travellers and availability of HEV diagnostic testing in the GeoSentinel surveillance network.Methods: This was a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional study. All confirmed and probable HEV travel-related infections reported in the GeoSentinel Network between 1999 and 2018 were evaluated. GeoSentinel sites were asked to complete a survey in 2018 to assess the availability and accessibility of HEV diagnostic procedures (i.e. serology and molecular tests) throughout the study period.Results: Overall, 165 travel-related HEV infections were reported, mainly since 2010 (60%) and in tourists (50%). Travellers were exposed to hepatitis E in 27 countries; most travellers (62%) were exposed to HEV in South Asia. One patient was pregnant at the time of HEV infection and 14 had a concomitant gastrointestinal infection. No deaths were reported. In the 51% of patients with information available, there was no pre-travel consultation. Among 44 GeoSentinel sites that responded to the survey, 73% have access to HEV serology at a local level, while 55% could perform (at a local or central level) molecular diagnostics.Conclusion: Reported access to HEV diagnostic testing is suboptimal among sites that responded to the survey; this could negatively affect diagnosing HEV. Pre-travel consultations before travel to South Asia and other low-income and high-prevalence areas with a focus on food and water precautions could be helpful in preventing hepatitis E infection. Improved HEV diagnostic capacity should be implemented to prevent and correctly diagnose travelrelated HEV infection.

TI  - 'Dust in the wind' from source-to-sink: Analysis of the 14-15 April 2015 storm in Utah
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 14-15 April 2015, an intense intermountain cyclone in the western USA caused high winds and a dust storm that degraded air quality in the eastern Great Basin, and deposited dust-on-snow (DOS) in the Wasatch Range near Salt Lake City, Utah. We analyzed the storm and documented its "source-to-sink" development to relate the frontal passage with dust mobilization, air quality changes, and dust deposition on montane snowpack near Alta, Utah. This case study is first to track a dust storm and measure the elemental composition and radiative properties of the resulting DOS as a single specific event layer in Wasatch montane snowpack; prior studies have assessed seasonally aggregated DOS deposits. Dust plumes on MODIS imagery indicate mobilization from known regional "hotspots" for aeolian activity, including clay- and silt-rich alluvium, modern playas, and disturbed areas within the Pleistocene Paleolake Bonneville Basin. This 2015 single event dust layer was 1-3 cm thick with a median dust size of 10.81-12.55 mu m; its measured radiative properties are similar to aggregated dusts previously assessed in Wasatch snowpack. Dust from the 2015 DOS event is enriched in the elements As, Cd, Cu, and Mo by a 10 x factor relative to average elemental concentrations in the upper continental crust; its heavy metals (Cu, Pb, As, Cd, Mo, Zn) are probably derived from regional mine operations. Tracking elemental fluxes from source-to-sink is important for resolving environmental impacts, and informing future analysis of single storm dust loading, ecosystem impacts, and quantity and quality of meltwater-fed drinking water.

TI  - Improving Resistive RAM Hard and Soft Decision Correctable BERs by Using Improved-LLR and Reset-Check-Reverse-Flag Concatenating LDPC Code
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - In prior researches, low-density-parity-check (LDPC) code is applied on high-speed magnetic random-access-memory (MRAM) for a better correctable bit error rate (CBER). However, on another emerging memory, resistive random-access-memory (RRAM), reset hard breakdown errors have high-reliability log-likelihood ratio (LLR) which significantly degrades LDPC code soft decision CBER and decoding iterations. To solve this issue, two schemes, improved-LLR and reset-check-reverse-flag (RCRF) concatenating systematic LDPC code (RCRF + LDPC), are proposed. The first scheme increases soft decision CBER by using asymmetric LLRs for matching the distribution of reset hard breakdown errors. In addition, RCRF corrects at least one reset error per array subsection. So, both hard and soft decision CBERs are improved. The best performance is obtained by combining these proposals. The hard decision CBER is increased by more than 50% on a wide range of LDPC code options. Moreover, soft decision CBER is improved by 69% and 51%, respectively, on a 1KB codeword, 0.91 code rate quasi-cyclic-LDPC (QC-LDPC) code, and a 2KB codeword, 0.89 code rate Mackey's code.

TI  - Fyodor Dostoevsky and Siberian Regionalism. Article Two
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the materials from Memoirs by Grigory Potanin and Russian Community in Prison and Exile by Nikolai Yandrintsev, this article aims to illustrate the crucial role of the Petrashevtsy in forming Siberian regionalism (oblastnichestvo) and analyse their contribution to shaping regionalism-related views and ideas. The Petrashevtsy played a key role in the development of Siberia. However, the present understanding of their contribution to the life in Siberia requires further study. Potanin, the leader of Siberian regionalism, repeatedly referred to the Petrashevtsy in his Memoirs, emphasizing the fact that it was the Petrashevtsy who played a crucial role in shaping his worldview; however, this material is rarely introduced into scientific discourse. Potanin's Memoirs gives special prominence to Sergey Durov, a member of the Petrashevtsy circle. According to Potanin, it was Durov who stipulated his spiritual turn: "I have become a Siberian patriot". In addition, at some point, he unprecedentedly called himself "a Petrashevtsy member": "after a meeting with Durov, I turned to the Petrashevtsy"; "Siberian patriot" and "a Petrashevtsy member" are synonyms in Potanin's text. Siberian regionalists (oblastniki) shared the fate of the Petrashevtsy in the most direct way. Arrested in 1865, they spent three years in Omsk prison waiting for the sentence at the place where Durov and Fyodor Dostoevsky, the Petrashevtsy members, served years of exile in the 1850s. The Siberian image of Dostoevsky and the thoughts about him in terms of Siberian regionalism were primarily shaped by Yandrintsev. In this respect, the article "Dostoevsky in Siberia" (1897) by Yandrintsev was the most significant. Siberian regionalists considered Notes from a Dead House to be the most outstanding and finest work by Dostoevsky. In Yandrintsev's opinion, it was exclusively exile that shaped Dostoevsky as a writer. When in Omsk prison, Yandrintsev rather deliberately continued the tradition of Russian prison writing initiated by Notes from a Dead House: based on the materials collected in Omsk prison, he wrote a book Russian Community in Prison and Exile (1872), in which where he repeatedly referred to Notes from a Dead House intensively quoting Dostoevsky and reflecting upon him. Thus, the works by Potanin and Yandrintsev analysed in the present article irrefutably demonstrate that the Petrashevtsy made a significant contribution to shaping and developing Siberian regionalism, its views and ideas. It is worth noting that Siberian regionalists always perceived Dostoevsky exclusively as a member of the Petrashevtsy.

TI  - Forest productivity and carbon stock analysis from vegetation phenological indices using satellite remote sensing in Indonesia
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the highest forest density in the world, and the productivity of its forests can potentially be maximized to minimize CO2 emissions. However, due to anthropogenic activities, phenological properties are subject to risk to ensure productivity and carbon exchange in the different forest ecosystems in Indonesia. Early prediction of carbon values could indicate a declining trend of forest quality with reference to vegetation levels. Thus, the purpose of this research is to evaluate forest productivity and carbon stock using phonological properties for different forests. The vegetation phenology was used to assess the level of forest productivity with different classifications to estimate carbon stock in six types of forest in south Sumatera using gross primary productivity (GPP) approaches. The vegetation phenologies were analyzed to develop a system dynamics model under two scenarios: first, a changing trend of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and second, a changing trend of area, considering either increasing or decreasing solar radiation in both scenarios. This system was run through the GIS environment to develop a database and to simulate results for future predictions. Verification was performed to test the simulation model by comparing the results with the IPCC reference. NDVI showed good correlations with GPP using MODIS MOD13Q1 for convertible production forest (CPF R-2=0.97), permanent production forest, PPF (R-2=0.99), limited production forest (LPF, R-2=0.98), tourism recreation forest (TRF, R-2=0.95), and wildlife reserve forest (WRF, R-2=0.95), nature reserve forest (NRF, R-2=0.99). The explicit differential function was used to estimate net primary productivity (NPP), which was related to the changes in area and productivity over time. Productivity and carbon stock analysis was performed via the proposal of five levels referring to Indonesian forest policy planning, considering resilience classified as high forest productivity (V1), moderate forest productivity (V2), marginal forest productivity (V3), very low forest productivity (N1), and no forest productivity (N2). TRF was found fall below the IPCC levels from 2015 to 2017, and NRF fall below the IPCC standards from 2015 to 2018. Therefore, the satellite-based remote sensing, system dynamics model can be implemented in the Indonesian forest policy system for assessing forest productivity and carbon stocks.

TI  - Impacts of land cover changes on desertification in northern Nigeria and implications on the Lake Chad Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is an issue of environmental concern in Nigeria, particularly the northern part of the country. This study examines land cover changes related to the process of desertification in the states along the northern boundary of Nigeria (Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, and Borno) and the implications on the Lake Chad Basin. A time series of Landsat imagery at a spatial resolution of 30 m was used over the period from 1984 to 2016. The imageries were subjected to maximum likelihood classification for the purpose of extracting the land cover and analysing the change. Also, the areal extent of vegetation cover within the 32-year period was calculated annually. Using Pearson's correlation analysis, the relationship between the vegetation cover and rainfall was assessed as well as temperature and population density. Results show that 45,945.08 km(2) of vegetation cover was lost within the study area including the Lake Chad area between 1984 and 2016. The annual rate of change varied across the different feature classes; the built-up area had the highest rate of increase of 13.68% and 2.65%, from 1984 to 2000 and 2000-2016 respectively. Bare-land increased at the rate of 0.96% and 0.28% from 1984 to 2000 and 2000-2016 respectively while vegetation had the highest rate of decrease of 2.18% and 2.02% from 1984 to 2000 and 2000-2016 respectively. A pattern of vegetation loss was observed as a large expanse of vegetation cover was lost across the north-west and the north-east regions including the Lake Chad area. It was also shown that the magnitude of vegetation cover correlated negatively with temperature and population density but with no significant correlation with the rainfall. The study recommends that the Federal Government should ensure the full implementation of the Great Green Wall project which is aimed at mitigating the rapid sprawl of natural land degradation processes and desertification in the northern boundary states.

TI  - Actor-network, conflict and the commodification of planning: Role of traditional food markets in shaping the built environment
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the processes of transformation of the architecture and spatial character of a Nigerian city, in the planning and delivery of a sustainable built environment. It examines the inter-dependency or relationship between the traditional market space and the city which is constantly being challenged, adapted and simultaneously undermined by the city's rapid growth and modernisation. Therefore, the meanings attached to the market and its built environment has not only changed on several levels from the symbolic, sacred, religious use to commercial and mundane one but also has taken on new spatial forms in sustaining the life of the city due to the activities of the various actors which is predicated on their worldview. The paper provides a detailed examination of the geographical location of the old market built environment, in relation to the expansion of the city over time. It traces historical changes in the surrounding urban-scape of the market, in particular, the location of developments, many originating from the colonial period, and their impact on the life of the market over time. It relates, how these historical relationships are registered both topographically and spatially providing supporting visual material such as maps and developmental plans. This paper further expatiates on the understanding of negotiation and conflict that ensued during the interaction within the material environment of the city through the prism of the role of actors (government officials, users, planners, politicians) involved with the built marketplace in the study area. Analyses provided through interpretive anthropology which is synchronic in nature (focus at events in a slice of time) and those provided by Actor-Network Theory (ANT) that is diachronic (focus on dynamic events through time), i.e. anthropology focuses more on the "static" past whereas ANT focuses on the activities of the actants in "dynamic" or "real-time". The paper concludes that theoretical and cultural interpretation impacts the physical marketplace, its form, character, and spatiality; this must itself be understood as an agent or actant in the struggle, in as much as it both enables and constrains human activities.

TI  - REMOTE SENSING FOR URBAN TREE CANOPY CHANGE DETECTION WITH LANDSAT SATELLITE DATA IN NNAMDI AZIKIWE UNIVERSITY AWKA - NIGERIA
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tree canopy within a university boundary is a measure of the university's tree cover as a percentage of its total land area. The overall objective of the present study is to conduct a spatio-temporal change analysis of urban tree canopy in Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka-Nigeria. Landsat data of years 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2019 were analysed using Maximum Likelihood Classifier and Confusion Matrix Spatial Analyst in ArcGIS 10.7.1 software. In terms of tree cover loss, there is a steady rate of decrease rate from -31.59 ha between 1991 and 2001; -82.32 ha (2001/2011) and -64.53 ha (2011/2019). Whereas, at an initial land area of 9.40 ha in 1991, physical infrastructural development is progressively increased with 16.92 ha between 1991 and 2001; 43.79 ha 2001/2011 and 12.37 ha between 2011 and 2019. The dominant drivers of tree cover change in the study area related to the expansion of physical infrastructures and sprawling agriculture as a result of encroachers into the study area. In conclusion, tropical forests within university campuses face many threats, such as those posed by unregulated physical infrastructural development and a lack of investment and management of forest relics. As a recommendation, Nigerian universities should invest and conserve their existing forested landscapes towards promoting land resources in line with Sustainable Development Goals number 15 (SDG-15) strategies.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Satellite-Based Rainfall Products over Nigeria
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the variability of rainfall is important for sustaining rain-dependent agriculture and driving the local economy of Nigeria. Paucity and inadequate rain gauge network across Nigeria has made satellite-based rainfall products (SRPs), which offer a complete spatial and consistent temporal coverage, a better alternative. However, the accuracy of these products must be ascertained before use in water resource developments and planning. In this study, the performances of Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Precipitation estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), were evaluated to investigate their ability to reproduce long term (1983-2013) observed rainfall characteristics derived from twenty-four (24) gauges in Nigeria. Results show that all products performed well in terms of capturing the observed annual cycle and spatial trends in all selected stations. Statistical evaluation of the SRPs performance show that CHIRPS agree more with observations in all climatic zones by reproducing the local rainfall characteristics. The performance of PERSIANN and TAMSAT, however, varies with season and across the climatic zones. Findings from this study highlight the benefits of using SRPs to augment or fill gaps in the distribution of local rainfall data, which is critical for water resources planning, agricultural development, and policy making.

TI  - Combining Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery to Improve Long-Term Monitoring of Temporary Surface Water Bodies in the Senegal River Floodplain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of surface water bodies is essential in numerous hydrological and agricultural applications. Combining imagery from multiple sensors can improve long-term monitoring; however, the benefits derived from each sensor and the methods to automate long-term water mapping must be better understood across varying periods and in heterogeneous water environments. All available observations from Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and MODIS over 1999-2019 are processed in Google Earth Engines to evaluate and compare the benefits of single and multi-sensor approaches in long-term water monitoring of temporary water bodies, against extensive ground truth data from the Senegal River floodplain. Otsu automatic thresholding is compared with default thresholds and site-specific calibrated thresholds to improve Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) classification accuracy. Otsu thresholding leads to the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and high overall accuracies on selected Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images, but performance declines when applied to long-term monitoring compared to default or site-specific thresholds. On MODIS imagery, calibrated thresholds are crucial to improve classification in heterogeneous water environments, and results highlight excellent accuracies even in small (19 km2) water bodies despite the 500 m spatial resolution. Over 1999-2019, MODIS observations reduce average daily RMSE by 48% compared to the full Landsat 7 and 8 archive and by 51% compared to the published Global Surface Water datasets. Results reveal the need to integrate coarser MODIS observations in regional and global long-term surface water datasets, to accurately capture flood dynamics, overlooked by the full Landsat time series before 2013. From 2013, the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 constellation becomes sufficient, and integrating MODIS observations degrades performance marginally. Combining Landsat and Sentinel-2 yields modest improvements after 2015. These results have important implications to guide the development of multi-sensor products and for applications across large wetlands and floodplains.

AB  - CAS500-1 and CAS500-2 are high-resolution Earth-observing satellites being developed and scheduled to launch for land monitoring of Korea. The satellite information will be used for land usage analysis, change detection, 3D topological monitoring, and so on. Satellite image data of region of interests must be acquired in the stereo mode from different positions for 3D information generation. Accurate 3D processing and 3D display of stereo satellite data requires the epipolar image resampling process considering the pushbroom sensor and the satellite trajectory. This study developed an epipolar image resampling module for CAS-500 stereo data processing and verified its accuracy performance by testing along-track, across-track, and heterogeneous stereo data.

TI  - Downscaling GPM Precipitation Using Finer-scale MODIS Based Optical Image in Korean Peninsula
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is closely related to various hydrometeorological phenomena, such as runoff and evapotranspiration. In Korean Peninsula, observing rainfall intensity using weather radar and rain gauge network is dominating due to their accurate, intuitive and precise detecting power. However, since these methods are not suitable at ungauged regions, rainfall detection using satellite is required. Satellite-based rainfall data has coarse spatial resolution (10 km, 25 km), and has a limited range of usage due to its reliability of data. The aim of this study is to obtain finer scale precipitation. Especially, to make the applicability of satellite higher at ungauged regions, 10 km satellite-based rainfall data was downscaled to 1 km data using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based cloud property. Downscaled precipitation was verified in urban region, which has complex topographical and environmental characteristics. Correlation coefficient was similar in summer (+0), decreased in spring (-0.08) and autumn (-0.01), and increased in winter (+0.04) season compared to Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) based precipitation. Downscaling without calibration using in situ data could be useful in areas where rain gauge system is not sufficient or ground observations are rarely available.

TI  - Assessment of land use impact and seepage erosion contributions to seasonal variations in riverbank stability: The Iju River, SW Nigeria
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Iju (Atuwara) River is an important component of the Owo River catchment (ORC), which supports the livelihood of millions of people in Lagos and Ogun States of southwestern Nigeria. However, rapid urbanisation and numerous anthropogenic activities have caused significant changes in the natural flow regime of the river, resulting in serious bank erosion. In many riparian areas, accelerated bank erosion has been attributed to the combined effects of seepage erosion and fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the hydraulic stress of the river on the bank. This research, therefore, investigated the combined effects of seepage erosion, riparian vegetation (root cohesion), tension crack, and land use/land cover (LULC) change on the stability of riverbanks on the Iju River, Nigeria. Multi-temporal LULC datasets acquired from remotely sensed Landsat images of 1999, 2009, and 2019 were used to map LULC changes in the ORC. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the geotechnical properties of the riverbanks followed by bank stability analysis and evaluation of the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM) and Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI), respectively. The BSTEM results indicate that the factor of safety (F-s) decreased with an increase in seepage undercutting distance (d(u)), irrespective of the bank angle. The correlation of F-s with root cohesion (c(r)) and depth of tension crack (z(c)) shows that F-s was positively correlated with cr but decreased with an increase in z(c). LULC change results show that the natural flow regimes of rivers within the ORC have been adversely affected by the combined decrease in vegetation and wetlands, with a corresponding increase in the spatial extents of the built-up area and cultivated land/open spaces. These research findings are essential for the development of a watershed-scale natural disaster management framework for the southwest ecoregion of Nigeria.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in determining the axillary lymph node metastasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is accepted as the standard procedure to determine the axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer at early stage. However, in many cases with sentinel lymph node positivity, the axilla does not contain any tumor cells. As a result, the accuracy of SLNB to predict axillary lymph node metastasis must be evaluated. Patients and Methods: Thousand hundred and fourteen women operated for breast cancer were retrospectively examined. Breast cancer patients without axillary metastasis on clinical examination who had undergone SLNB were included in the study. Sentinel lymph node positivity and axillary lymph node positivity were compared. Results: Among 1114 women operated for breast cancer, 230 were clinically node negative preoperatively and undergone SLNB. Eighty-three (36%) of the patients were SLNB positive and undergone axillary dissection. Forty-three (51.8%) of them had tumor positive axillary lymph nodes and 40 (48.2%) of them had tumor negative axillary lymph nodes. Interpretation: In 48.2% of the patients, positive sentinel lymph node does not demonstrate a positive axilla. This finding supports sparing axillary dissection in patients with favorable prognostic factors even if the sentinel lymph node is found to be positive. Conclusion: Axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) may be spared even if there are macrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes in patients with favorable tumor types who will undergo breast-conserving surgery.

AB  - Permafrost and ground ice are important features of the landscape that can significantly affect infrastructure in cold regions. Information on thaw susceptibility is important for predicting the behaviour of permafrost as an engineering substrate. We compare apparent conductivity surveys to ground displacement obtained from differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar with the objective of establishing apparent conductivity as an indicator of thaw susceptibility for regional characterization of terrain stability and permafrost conditions along the western coast of Hudson Bay, Nunavut. For field conditions where ground displacement and conductivity are influenced by surficial geology, there is a correlation between high seasonal and inter-annual subsidence and low apparent conductivity, and between high seasonal and inter-annual subsidence and high seasonal conductivity ratio, inferred to be indicative of high ice content and thaw-related displacement. For field conditions with no strong influence of surficial geology, a dear correspondence between subsidence and apparent conductivity does not exist. Nevertheless, the geophysical data are useful in identifying relevant factors for characterization of terrain stability such as saline permafrost and an ice-rich top of permafrost that experience significant seasonal fluctuations in unfrozen water content. When utilizing low-induction number electromagnetic surveys in permafrost terrain, apparent conductivity must be corrected for a depth-dependent temperature profile. For this study, correction factors of 6-13% are required to compensate for temperature variation, or 2.1% per degrees C at half-depth, but this is not necessarily applicable to other temperature profiles.

TI  - Testing Urban Flood Mapping Approaches from Satellite and In-Situ Data Collected during 2017 and 2019 Events in Eastern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing frequency of flooding worldwide has driven research to improve near real-time flood mapping from remote-sensing data. Improved automation and processing speed to map both open water and vegetated area flooding have resulted from these research efforts. Despite these achievements, flood mapping in urban areas where a significant number of overall impacts are felt remains a challenge. Near real-time data availability, shadowing caused by manmade infrastructure, spatial resolution, and cloud cover inhibiting optical transmission, are all factors that complicate detailed urban flood mapping needed to inform response efforts. This paper uses numerous data sources collected during two major flood events that impacted the same region of Eastern Canada in 2017 and 2019 to test different urban flood mapping approaches presented as case studies in three separate urban boroughs. Cloud-free high-resolution 3 m PlanetLab optical data acquired near peak-flood in 2019 were used to generate a maximum flood extent product for that year. Approaches using new Lidar Digital Elevation Models (DEM)s and water height estimated from nineteen RADARSAT-2 flood maps, point-based flood perimeter observations from citizen geographic information, and simulated traffic camera or other urban sensor network data were tested and verified using independent data. Coherent change detection (CCD) using multi-temporal Interferometric Wide (IW) Sentinel-1 data was also tested. Results indicate that while clear-sky high-resolution optical imagery represents the current gold standard, its availability is not guaranteed due to timely coverage and cloud cover. Water height estimated from 8 to 12.5 m resolution RADARSAT-2 flood perimeters were not sufficiently accurate to flood adjacent urban areas using a Lidar DEM in near real-time, but all nineteen scenes combined captured boroughs that flooded at least once in both flood years. CCD identified flooded boroughs and roughly captured their flood extents, but lacked timeliness and sufficient detail to inform street-level decision-making in near real-time. Point-based flood perimeter observation, whether from in-situ sensors or high-resolution optical satellites combined with Lidar DEMs, can generate accurate full flood extents under certain conditions. Observed point-based flood perimeters on manmade features with low topographic variation produced the most accurate flood extents due to reliable water height estimation from these points.

TI  - Ecological Risk Assessment Based on Land Cover Changes: A Case of Zanzibar (Tanzania)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) under improper land management is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa and has drastically affected ecological security. Addressing environmental impacts related to this challenge requires efficient planning strategies based on the measured information of land use patterns. This study assessed the ecological risk index (ERI) of Zanzibar based on LULC. A random forest classifier was used to classify three Landsat images of Zanzibar for the years 2003, 2009, and 2018. Then, a land change model was employed to simulate the LULC changes for 2027 under a business-as-usual (BAU), conservation, and extreme scenarios. Results showed that the built-up areas and farmland of Zanzibar Island have increased constantly, while the natural grassland and forest cover have decreased. The forest, agricultural, and grassland were highly fragmented into several small patches. The ERI of Zanzibar Island increased at a constant rate and, if the current trend continues, this index will increase by up to 8.9% in 2027 under an extreme scenario. If a conservation scenario is adopted, the ERI will increase by 4.6% whereas if a BAU policy is followed, this value will increase by 6.2%. This study provides authorities with useful information to understand better the ecological processes and LULC dynamics and prevent unmanaged growth and haphazard development of informal housing and infrastructure.

M3  - Article
AB  - Do scientists have a responsibility to act affirmatively to ensure that our findings are known, understood, and put to use to protect our fellow citizens, even if it means expanding our activities beyond the field and the laboratory? I argue that scientists have a sentinel responsibility to alert society to threats about which ordinary people have no other way of knowing. However, the same expertise that makes a scientist an appropriate sentinel in one or several domains almost necessarily makes them inexpert in other domains. I believe that we should exercise restraint when asked to intercede in areas beyond our proximate expertise.

TI  - Leaf Nitrogen Concentration and Plant Height Prediction for Maize Using UAV-Based Multispectral Imagery and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under ideal conditions of nitrogen (N), maize (Zea mays L.) can grow to its full potential, reaching maximum plant height (PH). As a rapid and nondestructive approach, the analysis of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery may be of assistance to estimate N and height. The main objective of this study is to present an approach to predict leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, g kg(-1)) and PH (m) with machine learning techniques and UAV-based multispectral imagery in maize plants. An experiment with 11 maize cultivars under two rates of N fertilization was carried during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons. The spectral vegetation indices (VI) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), green normalized difference vegetation (GNDVI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were extracted from the images and, in a computational system, used alongside the spectral bands as input parameters for different machine learning models. A randomized 10-fold cross-validation strategy, with a total of 100 replicates, was used to evaluate the performance of 9 supervised machine learning (ML) models using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of regression (R-2), and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. The results indicated that the random forest (RF) algorithm performed better, with r and RMSE, respectively, of 0.91 and 1.9 g.kg(-)(1) for LNC, and 0.86 and 0.17 m for PH. It was also demonstrated that VIs contributed more to the algorithm's performances than individual spectral bands. This study concludes that the RF model is appropriate to predict both agronomic variables in maize and may help farmers to monitor their plants based upon their LNC and PH diagnosis and use this knowledge to improve their production rates in the subsequent seasons.

TI  - Bias Correction of the Ratio of Total Column CH<sub>4</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub> Retrieved from GOSAT Spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The proxy method, using the ratio of total column CH4 to CO2 to reduce the effects of common biases, has been used to retrieve column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CH4 from satellite data. The present study characterizes the remaining scattering effects in the CH4/CO2 ratio component of the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) retrieval and uses them for bias correction. The variation of bias between the GOSAT and Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ratio component with GOSAT data-derived variables was investigated. Then, it was revealed that the variability of the bias could be reduced by using four variables for the bias correction-namely, airmass, 2 mu m band radiance normalized with its noise level, the ratio between the partial column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CH4 for the lower atmosphere and that for the upper atmosphere, and the difference in surface albedo between the CH4 and CO2 bands. The ratio of partial column CH4 reduced the dependence of bias on the cloud fraction and the difference between hemispheres. In addition to the reduction of bias (from 0.43% to 0%), the precision (standard deviation of the difference between GOSAT and TCCON) was reduced from 0.61% to 0.55% by the correction. The bias and its temporal variation were reduced for each site: the mean and standard deviation of the mean bias for individual seasons were within 0.2% for most of the sites.

TI  - Seasonal Dynamics and Spatial Distribution of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in a Temperate Region in Europe, Southern Portugal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito that has colonized several European countries as well as Portugal, where it was detected for the first time in 2017. To increase the knowledge of Ae. albopictus population dynamics, a survey was carried out in the municipality of Loule, Algarve, a Southern temperate region of Portugal, throughout 2019, with Biogents Sentinel traps (BGS traps) and ovitraps. More than 19,000 eggs and 400 adults were identified from May 9 (week 19) and December 16 (week 50). A positive correlation between the number of females captured in the BGS traps and the number of eggs collected in ovitraps was found. The start of activity of A. albopictus in May corresponded to an average minimum temperature above 13.0 degrees C and an average maximum temperature of 26.2 degrees C. The abundance peak of this A. albopictus population was identified from September to November. The positive effect of temperature on the seasonal activity of the adult population observed highlight the importance of climate change in affecting the occurrence, abundance, and distribution patterns of this species. The continuously monitoring activities currently ongoing point to an established population of A. albopictus in Loule, Algarve, in a dispersion process to other regions of Portugal and raises concern for future outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases associated with this invasive mosquito species.

TI  - The function of sentinel alarm calls in the Arabian babbler
T2  - JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In various group-living species, from time to time one of the group members acts as a sentinel and utters alarm calls when detecting a predator. Hearing these calls, other group mates usually react by quickly changing their behaviour. Uttering alarm calls is an anti-predator mechanism with several possible functions. In this study our aim was to assess the function of alarm calls in the Arabian babbler Argya squamiceps, a cooperatively breeding songbird. We observed 10 groups in natural conditions and recorded 1000 reactions of 55 foraging group members to 268 sets of alarm calls uttered by the sentinels. The most frequent reaction of the group members to the sentinel's alarm calls was to stop foraging immediately, to fly up to the closest treetop and to start calling alarm calls. In all the recorded cases, the sentinel remained in place and continued to call. The alarm calls continued as long as the raptor could be seen, and then ceased gradually, after which babblers flew down and returned to foraging. We conclude that the main function of alarm calls in the Arabian babbler is pursuit deterrence. In particular, while foragers benefit from the information content of the sentinel's alarm calls and react on their basis, the raptor is the primary audience addressed by the calls uttered by the sentinel and the foragers who join it.

TI  - PHYTOPLANKTON in the SEA of OKHOTSK along WESTERN KAMCHATKA: WARM vs COLD YEARS
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses phytoplankton distribution on the West Kamchatka shelf of the Sea of Okhotsk by comparing phytoplankton in spring-summer-autumn seasons of warm 2015 and cold 2016. Mathematical models are used to estimate the phytoplankton abundance in the water column. A model with an adaptation function is proposed. Satellite data on a sea surface are used as initial condition for solving a system of equations in a mathematical model. Satellite measurements contain chlorophyll "a" concentration, temperature and illumination for the surface water layer. Depth illumination is calculated by differential equation. Models tested on the basis of in situ data show an adequate display of the dynamics of integrated biomass depending on external conditions. The integrated use of satellites and information in situ makes it possible to estimate the phytoplankton abundance over a large area. To compare phytoplankton distributions in warm 2015 and cold 2016, a model with an adaptation function is used. The shelf of Western Kamchatka with its warm and cold year alternations shows the dynamics of the species composition vs the year type. Species composition changes to make the phytoplankton community be better adapted to changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Updating of Land Cover Maps and Change Analysis Using GlobeLand30 Product: A Case Study in Shanghai Metropolitan Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land cover mapping and change analysis is essential for natural resource management and ecosystem monitoring. GlobeLand30 is a global land cover product from China with 30 m resolution that provides reliable data for many international scientific programs. Few studies have focused on systematically implementing this global land cover product in regional studies. Therefore, this paper presents an object-based extended change vector analysis (ECVA_OB) and transfer learning method to update the reginal land cover map using GlobeLand30 product. The method is designed to highlight small and subtle changes through the concept of uncertain area analysis. Updating is carried out by classifying changed objects using a change-detection-based transfer learning method. Land cover changes are analyzed and the factors affecting updating results are explored. The method was tested with data from Shanghai, China, a city that has experienced significant changes in the past decade. The experimental results show that: (1) the change detection and classification accuracy of the proposed method are 83.30% and 78.77%, respectively, which are significantly better than the values obtained for the multithreshold change vector analysis (MCVA) and the multithreshold change vector analysis and support vector machine (MCVA + SVM) methods; (2) the updated results agree well with GlobeLand30 2010, especially for cultivated land and artificial surfaces, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method; (3) the most significant changes over the past decade in Shanghai were from cultivated land to artificial surfaces, and the total area containing artificial surfaces in Shanghai increased by about 55% from 2000 to 2011. The factors affecting the updating results are also discussed, which be attributed to the classification accuracy of the base image, extended change vector analysis, and object-based image analysis.

TI  - Insight into the climatology of different sand-dust aerosol types over the Taklimakan Desert based on the observations from radiosonde and A-train satellites
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical distributions of sand-dust aerosols (SDAs) over the Taklimakan Desert (TD; 37 degrees N-41 degrees N, 78 degrees E-88 degrees E) that occurred during the spring are essential for both long-range transport and climate effects, apart from the living environment and health. In this study, we investigated the optical properties of SDAs and evaluated the correlation between optical properties and meteorological factors over the TD area located in the northwest of China. For this, we have utilized the A-train multiple-satellite remote sensing data provided quasi-synchronized observations by the Cloud-aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), CloudSat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments for the study period during 2007-2010. Besides, we have verified the meteorological factors observed from the CALIPSO to know the applicability and reliability with the Radiosonde sounding data. We found that the cloud-aerosol discrimination (CAD) algorithm can accurately identify clouds and SDAs over the TD area, especially during blowing dust/floating dust (BD/FD). Overall, it is revealed that the total depolarization ratio of SDAs is below 0.5. Besides, the temperature (T) and pressure (P) of CALIPSO satellite products data are in excellent agreement with the radiosonde sounding measured data over the TD area. Further, most data points during the DS (BD/FD) event spread towards lower (higher) relative humidity (RH) ranged between 0.0386 and 0.6306 (0.1079 and 1.00). Our analysis provides the observational evidence from the CALIOP that the optical properties of vertical dust particles and meteorological elements over the TD have distinct variability below and above 4 km height for DS and BD/FD events. The results obtained will provide not only reliable reference values for the improvement of the CAD algorithm used in the CALIPSO but also provide critical information for model evaluation and enhancement of CALIPSO products.

TI  - Quantitative Detection and Attribution of Groundwater Level Variations in the Amu Darya Delta
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few decades, the shrinkage of the Aral Sea is one of the biggest ecological catastrophes caused by human activity. To quantify the joint impact of both human activities and climate change on groundwater, the spatiotemporal groundwater dynamic characteristics in the Amu Darya Delta of the Aral Sea from 1999 to 2017 were analyzed, using the groundwater level, climate conditions, remote sensing data, and irrigation information. Statistics analysis was adopted to analyze the trend of groundwater variation, including intensity, periodicity, spatial structure, while the Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on the variabilities of the groundwater level. Results reveal that the local groundwater dynamic has varied considerably. From 1999 to 2002, the groundwater level dropped from -189 cm to -350 cm. Until 2017, the groundwater level rose back to -211 cm with fluctuation. Seasonally, the fluctuation period of groundwater level and irrigation water was similar, both were about 18 months. Spatially, the groundwater level kept stable within the irrigation area and bare land but fluctuated drastically around the irrigation area. The Pearson correlation analysis reveals that the dynamic of the groundwater level is closely related to irrigation activity within the irrigation area (Nukus: -0.583), while for the place adjacent to the Aral Sea, the groundwater level is closely related to the Large Aral Sea water level (Muynak: 0.355). The results of PCA showed that the cumulative contribution rate of the first three components exceeds 85%. The study reveals that human activities have a great impact on groundwater, effective management, and the development of water resources in arid areas is an essential prerequisite for ecological protection.

AB  - Daily evapotranspiration (ET) controlled by latent energy (LE) is an important variable used in the study of hydrology, meteorology, and ecology. A constant solar radiation ratio approach was introduced to the LE retrieval algorithm based on a nonparametric ET approach to upscale instantaneous LE temporally. On the basis of the proposed algorithm, this study retrieved the daily and eight-day LE using Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System products and evaluated the daily and eight-day LE retrieval by using the ground observations and MOD16 product in Zhangye City during 25 June to 15 September 2012. Results show that the temporal-spatial distribution of retrieved result was reliable. The retrieved daily/eight-day LE could capture the dynamic change of ground observations, whereas the MOD16 LE was invalid. The retrieved daily (eight-day) LE was underestimated at all four (two) sites, with bias, root mean square error, andR(2)of -7.9 to -2.2 W m(-2)(approximately -5 W m(-2)), 19.8 to 39.0 W m(-2)(approximately 10 W m(-2)), and 0.72 to 0.84 (approximately 0.9), respectively. The proposed approach showed more satisfactory performance than the triangle approach under clear sky condition. The eight-day LE retrieval was considerably better than MOD16 LE and had (no/slight) influence on MOD16 LE (eight-day retrieval). In addition, the accurate estimation of net radiation, soil heat flux, land surface temperature, and air temperature could aid in improving LE retrieval. Future studies would focus on the improvement of the retrieval algorithm, input accuracy, and residuals.

TI  - InSAR Greece with Parallelized Persistent Scatterer Interferometry: A National Ground Motion Service for Big Copernicus Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry have enabled the seamless monitoring of the Earth's crust deformation. The dense archive of the Sentinel-1 Copernicus mission provides unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage; however, time-series analysis of such big data volumes requires high computational efficiency. We present a parallelized-PSI (P-PSI), a novel, parallelized, and end-to-end processing chain for the fully automated assessment of line-of-sight ground velocities through persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), tailored to scale to the vast multitemporal archive of Sentinel-1 data. P-PSI is designed to transparently access different and complementary Sentinel-1 repositories, and download the appropriate datasets for PSI. To make it efficient for large-scale applications, we re-engineered and parallelized interferogram creation and multitemporal interferometric processing, and introduced distributed implementations to best use computing cores and provide resourceful storage management. We propose a new algorithm to further enhance the processing efficiency, which establishes a non-uniform patch grid considering land use, based on the expected number of persistent scatterers. P-PSI achieves an overall speed-up by a factor of five for a full Sentinel-1 frame for processing in a 20-core server. The processing chain is tested on a large-scale project to calculate and monitor deformation patterns over the entire extent of the Greek territory-our own Interferometric SAR (InSAR) Greece project. Time-series InSAR analysis was performed on volumes of about 12 TB input data corresponding to more than 760 Single Look Complex Sentinel-1A and B images mostly covering mainland Greece in the period of 2015-2019. InSAR Greece provides detailed ground motion information on more than 12 million distinct locations, providing completely new insights into the impact of geophysical and anthropogenic activities at this geographic scale. This new information is critical to enhancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, providing valuable input into risk assessment models. We showcase this through the identification of various characteristic geohazard locations in Greece and discuss their criticality. The selected geohazard locations, among a thousand, cover a wide range of catastrophic events including landslides, land subsidence, and structural failures of various scales, ranging from a few hundredths of square meters up to the basin scale. The study enriches the large catalog of geophysical related phenomena maintained by the GeObservatory portal of the Center of Earth Observation Research and Satellite Remote Sensing BEYOND of the National Observatory of Athens for the opening of new knowledge to the wider scientific community.

TI  - Sharpening of Worldview-3 Satellite Images by Generating Optimal High-Spatial-Resolution Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to using images in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range only, remotely sensed satellite imagery from the spectral wavelengths of both VNIR and shortwave infrared (SWIR), such as Sentinel-2A and Worldview-3, is more effective for analyzing various types of information for tasks such as land cover mapping, environmental monitoring and land use change detection. In this manuscript, a new sharpening technique to enhance the spatial resolution of Worldview-3 satellite imagery with various spatial and spectral resolutions is proposed. Selected and synthesized band schemes were used to produce optimal panchromatic images; then, sharpened images were generated by applying the Gram-Schmidt adaptive (GSA) and Gram-Schmidt 2 (GS2) techniques, which are component substitution (CS)- and multiresolution analysis (MRA)-based algorithms, respectively. In addition, to minimize the spectral distortion of the initial sharpened image, a postprocessing methodology for spectral distortion reduction was developed. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the sharpened images showed that the pansharpening performance using the GS2 technique based on the selected band scheme and spectral distortion reduction was the best. To confirm the usability of the SWIR band, supervised classification based on machine learning was performed on the pansharpened images obtained by applying the technique proposed in this study and on the pansharpened images obtained by the VNIR bands only. The classification accuracy of the results using SWIR bands was higher than that of VNIR bands only. In particular, it was confirmed that the accuracy of the classification of artificial facilities known to be effective for SWIR bands was greatly improved.

TI  - Relationship between Remotely Sensed Ambient PM10 and PM2.5 and Urban Forest in Seoul, South Korea
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently particulate matter (PM) is one of the major threats to public health and safety in urban areas such as Seoul, South Korea. The limited amount of air-quality monitoring systems may not provide sufficient data or coverage, in particular on the spots of urban forest. Considering urban forest as a possible contributor to mitigate PM in an urban area, this study investigated the relationship between the size and topography of urban forests near the air-quality monitoring stations and PM measurements from those stations. The average of PM measurements during the study period of August 2017 to July 2019 was computed into three different domains by using three concentric buffers from 25 monitoring stations distributed across Seoul. To estimate PM concentrations, multiple linear regression models were developed by using satellite-borne multi-spectral band data retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard Terra (MODIS) and Landsat 8 in conjunction with meteorological data sets. Overall, PM10 and PM2.5 measurements significantly varied with season and tended to be lower with large urban forests than small ones by 5.3% for PM10 and 4.8% for PM2.5. Overall, PM10 and PM2.5 measurements were lower at the domains encompassing high urban forests in elevation than those of relatively flattened forests by 9.1% for PM10 and 3.9% for PM2.5. According to the findings from this study, the topographical difference among urban forests could exert a more significant influence on PM mitigation. The result from correlation analysis between the PM estimates from Landsat 8-based models and ground-based PM measurements was considered reliable based on Pearson's coefficients of 0.21 to 0.74 for PM10 and -0.33 to 0.74 for PM2.5. It was considered that using a satellite imagery-derived PM model could be effective to manage urban forest over a large area which in general implies the limitation of data collection.

TI  - Evaluation of Spatio-temporal Fusion Models of Multi-sensor High-resolution Satellite Images for Crop Monitoring: An Experiment on the Fusion of Sentinel-2 and RapidEye Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of representative spatio-temporal fusion models developed for the fusion of mid- and low-resolution satellite images in order to construct a set of time-series high-resolution images for crop monitoring. Particularly, the effects of the characteristics of input image pairs on the prediction performance are investigated by considering the principle of spatio-temporal fusion. An experiment on the fusion of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images in agricultural fields was conducted to evaluate the prediction performance. Three representative fusion models, including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), SParse-representation-based SpatioTemporal reflectance Fusion Model (SPSTFM), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), were applied to this comparative experiment. The three spatio-temporal fusion models exhibited different prediction performance in terms of prediction errors and spatial similarity. However, regardless of the model types, the correlation between coarse resolution images acquired on the pair dates and the prediction date was more significant than the difference between the pair dates and the prediction date to improve the prediction performance. In addition, using vegetation index as input for spatio-temporal fusion showed better prediction performance by alleviating error propagation problems, compared with using fused reflectance values in the calculation of vegetation index. These experimental results can be used as basic information for both the selection of optimal image pairs and input types, and the development of an advanced model in spatio-temporal fusion for crop monitoring.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Low Axillary Sampling in Predicting Nodal Status of Postchemotherapy Axilla in Women With Breast Cancer
T2  - JCO GLOBAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE We tested low axillary sampling (LAS) and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) performed in the same patient to predict axillary nodal status post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in women undergoing elective breast surgery, clinically N0 after NACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 751 women clinically node negative post-NACT underwent LAS (excision of lymph node [LN] and fat below first intercostobrachial nerve). Of these women, 730 also underwent SNB by dual technique (methylene blue plus radioisotope). SNB (defined as targeted plus palpable LNs) and LAS specimens were distinctly examined for metastasis. All patients underwent completion axillary lymph node dissection. Post-NACT, 290 (38.6%) of 751 women had residual positive lymph nodes on pathology.RESULTS The median clinical tumor size was 5 cm (range, 1-15 cm), and 533 (71%) of patients were N1 or N2 at presentation. Targeted sentinel node (SN) identification was 85.7% (626 of 730; median, two LNs); SN with palpable nodes was found in 95.2% (695 of 730; median, five LNs); LAS node was identified in 98.5% (740 of 751; median, seven LNs). In all but one case, the SN was found within the LAS specimen. The false negative rate (FNR) of SNB (blue, hot, and adjacent palpable nodes) was 19.7% (47 of 238; one-sided 95% CI upper limit, 24.0), compared with an FNR of 9.9% for LAS (29 of 292; one-sided 95% CI upper limit, 12.8; P < .001). If SNB was confined to blue/hot node, excluding adjacent palpable nodes, the FNR was 31.6% (74 of 234; one-sided 95% CI upper limit, 36.6). The FNR could be brought down to < 8.8% if three or more LNs were identified by LAS.CONCLUSION LAS is superior to SNB in identification rate, FNR, and negative predictive value in predicting node-negative axilla post-NACT. LAS can be safely used to predict negative axilla with < 10% chance of leaving residual disease. (c) 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Emotional determinants of life-space through GPS and ecological momentary assessment in schizophrenia: What gets people out of the house?
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Previous research employing global positioning satellite (GPS) data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has shown a smaller life-space (distance traveled from home) was associated with poorer community functioning and more severe negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Momentary emotional experiences may influence how much time is spent outside of the home. We evaluated the associations between emotional experiences in relation to life-space among people with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (HCs).Methods: 105 participants with schizophrenia and 76 HCs completed in-lab assessments of symptoms, cognition, and functioning. Participants completed EMA assessments of location and emotions seven times daily for seven days at stratified random intervals. GPS coordinates were collected 24 h a day over the 7-day study period. Analyses were performed at the momentary, day, and full week level using mixed effects models and Spearman correlations.Results: For HCs, greater happiness was associated with greater concurrent distance traveled away from home as measured by GPS. For participants with schizophrenia, greater anxiety was associated with greater distance traveled away from home and being outside of the home. Less happiness, but not anxiety, was also associated with greater negative symptoms, especially outside the home.Discussion: These findings suggest diminished positive emotion is associated with the experience of leaving the home in schizophrenia, but also suggest that anxiety may contribute to avoidance of out of home mobility. Interventions targeting both positive emotions and social anxiety may improve social functioning, and life-space may provide a useful outcome for functional rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia.

TI  - Reforestation and Deforestation in Northern Luzon, Philippines: Critical Issues as Observed from Space
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the richest in biodiversity globally has been the Philippine rainforest, which used to cover about 90% of the country's land area. During the last few decades, the forest cover has been reduced to less than 10% of the original, only a fraction of which is old-growth forest. The negative impacts of deforestation led to the launching of the National Greening Program (NGP) that involved the planting of more than a billion seedlings over a few million hectares of land from 2011 to 2016. To assess the success of the NGP, satellite data from Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were analyzed before, during, and after the NGP. Reforestation in the NGP sites was examined concurrently with observed deforestation in Luzon using forest loss data derived from Landsat for the period 2001 to 2018. The results show that losses declined from 2011 to 2015 but increased from 2016 to 2018. Because of such losses, the net effect is a balance of reforestation and deforestation or no significant gain from the NGP. Case studies were done in three sites in the Sierra Madre forest, where half of the remaining old-growth forest is located, using a combination of Landsat and Very High Resolution (VHR) data. The Landsat data were classified into closed forest, open forest, and other vegetation cover types. The conversion from one vegetation cover type to another was evaluated through the use of the Sankey Diagram. While some non-forest types became open or closed forests, the loss of open or closed forests is more pronounced. VHR data reveal critical issues happening within the NGP sites during the NGP period. More comprehensive data from MODIS also confirm that there was no significant increase in the forest cover in Luzon, Sierra Madre, and Cordillera from 2001 to 2018.

TI  - Evaporative Fluxes and Surface Soil Moisture Retrievals in a Mediterranean Setting from Sentinel-3 and the "Simplified Triangle"
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) makes it possible to obtain information on key parameters characterizing interactions among Earth's system components, such as evaporative fraction (EF) and surface soil moisture (SSM). Notably, techniques utilizing EO data of land surface temperature (Ts) and vegetation index (VI) have shown promise in this regard. The present study investigates, for the first time, the accuracy of one such technique, known as the "simplified triangle", using Sentinel-3 EO data, acquired for 44 days in 2018 at three savannah FLUXNET sites in Spain. The technique was found to be able to predict both EF and SSM with reasonable accuracy when compared to collocated ground measurements. Comparisons performed for all days together showed relatively low Root Mean square Difference (RMSD) for both EF (0.191) and SSM (0.012 cm(3) cm(-3)) and good correlation coefficients (R) of 0.721 and 0.577, respectively. Both EF and SSM were also largely in agreement with land cover and seasonal variability. The present study comprises the first detailed assessment of the "simplified triangle", in this case, using Sentinel-3 data and in a Mediterranean setting. Findings, albeit preliminary, are of significant value regarding the use of the investigated technique as a tool of environmental management, and towards ongoing, worldwide efforts aiming at developing operationally relevant products based on the Ts/VI feature space and EO data based on new satellites such as Sentinel-3.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine technical-, patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors associated with NIR guided SLN identification.Background: Missed nodal disease correlates with recurrence in early stage NSCLC. NIR-guided SLN mapping may improve staging and outcomes through identification of occult nodal disease.Methods: Retrospective analysis of 2 phase I clinical trials investigating NIR-guided SLN mapping utilizing ICG in patients with surgically resectable NSCLC.Results: In total, 66 patients underwent NIR-guided SLN mapping and lymphadenectomy after peritumoral ICG injection. There was significantly increased likelihood of SLN identification with injection dose >= 1 mg compared to <1 mg (65.2% vs 35.0%, P = 0.05), lung ventilation after injection (65.2% vs 35.0%, P = 0.05), and albumin dissolvent (68.1%) compared to fresh frozen plasma (28.6%) and sterile water (20.0%) (P = 0.01). In patients receiving the optimized ICG injection, there was significantly increased likelihood of SLN identification with radiologically solid nodules compared to sub-solid nodules (77.4% vs 33.3%, P = 0.04) and anatomic resection compared to wedge resection (88.2% vs 52.2%, P = 0.04). Disease-free and overall survival are 100% in those with a histologically negative SLN identified (n = 25) compared to 73.6% (P = 0.02) and 63.6% (P = 0.01) in patients with node negative NSCLC established via routine lymphadenectomy alone (n = 22).Conclusions: SLN(s) are more reliably identified with ICG dose >= 1 mg, albumin dissolvent, post-injection lung ventilation, radiologically solid nodules, and anatomic resections. To date, N0 status when established via NIR SLN mapping seems to be associated with decreased recurrence and improved survival after surgery for NSCLC.

TI  - Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 and the double-strand RNA-dependent kinase, PKR: When two kinases for the common good turn bad
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 alpha/beta and the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase PKR are two sentinel kinases that carry-out multiple similar yet distinct functions in both the cytosol and the nucleus. While these kinases belong to separate signal transduction cascades, they demonstrate an uncanny propensity to regulate many of the same proteins either through direct phosphorylation or by altering transcription/translation, including: c-MYC, NF-kappa B, p53 and TAU, as well as each another. A significant number of studies centered on the GSK3 kinases have led to the identification of the GSK3 interactome and a number of substrates, which link GSK3 activity to metabolic control, translation, RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, cellular division, DNA repair and stress/inflammatory signaling. Interestingly, many of these same pathways and processes are controlled by PKR, but unlike the GSK3 kinases, a clear picture of proteins interacting with PKR and a complete listing of its substrates is still missing. In this review, we take a detailed look at what is known about the PKR and GSK3 kinases, how these kinases interact to influence common cellular processes (innate immunity, alternative splicing, translation, glucose metabolism) and how aberrant activation of these kinases leads to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer.

TI  - Assessment of the "Zero-Bias Line" Homogenization Method for Microwave Radiometers Using Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B Tandem Phase
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term stability of microwave radiometers (MWR) on-board altimetry missions is critical to reduce the uncertainty on the global mean sea level estimate. Harmonization and homogenization steps are applied to MWR observations in that perspective. The Sentinel-3 tandem phase provides a unique opportunity to quantify the uncertainties on the "zero-bias line" homogenization approach defined by Bennartz et al. (2020). Initially developed to improve the performance of the wet tropospheric correction retrieval, it is used here to provide a common reference for the inter-calibration between Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B MWR. A simplified version of the "zero-bias line" approach, a linear correction depending on brightness temperatures, allows to strongly reduce the bias between the two radiometers for both channels (about 0.5 K) and the standard deviation of the difference (0.3 K). The full version of the approach adding a dependency on wind speed has improved the quality of the WTC retrieval (Bennartz et al. 2020) but degrades the performance of the homogenization. It is thus recommended to apply the simplified version of this approach in the processing of fundamental data record. The quantification of the uncertainties on the homogenization approach is only possible due to the ideal configuration of the Sentinel-3 tandem phase. The same dataset and the same metrics could be used to assess other approaches.

TI  - Predicted Maps for Soil Organic Matter Evaluation: The Case of Abruzzo Region (Italy)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic matter, an important component of healthy soils, may be used as an indicator in sustainability assessments. Managing soil carbon storage can foster agricultural productivity and environmental quality, reducing the severity and costs of natural phenomena. Thus, accurately estimating the spatial variability of soil organic matter (SOM) is crucial for sustainable soil management when planning agro-environmental measures at the regional level. SOM variability is very large in Italy, and soil organic carbon (SOC) surveys considering such variability are difficult and onerous. The study concerns the Abruzzo Region (about 10,800 km(2)), in Central Italy, where data from 1753 soil profiles were available, together with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Landsat images. Some morphometric parameters and spectral indices with a significant degree of correlation with measured data were used as predictors for regression-kriging (RK) application. Estimated map of SOC stocks, and of SOM related to USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) texture-an additional indicator of soil quality-were produced with a satisfactory level of accuracy. Results showed that SOC stocks and SOM concentrations in relation to texture were lower in the hilly area along the shoreline, pointing out the need to improve soil management to guarantee agricultural land sustainability.

T2  - QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Operating rooms (ORs) and surgical settings are potential sources of sentinel adverse events. To better understand the characteristics of errors in OR processes, we performed prospective risk analysis. Methods: The study was mixed qualitative and quantitative research. We used the Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) method to analyze the selected perioperative, operative, and postoperative processes in the OR via a 2-round Delphi technique. We identified the most prominent failure modes according to a Hazard Decision Matrix, analyzed and categorized proposed possible causes, and provided solutions to mitigate hazard scores. Results: Ten important processes and 7 subprocesses within the OR were selected and mapped, and 187 failure modes were identified and scored on the basis of severity and probability. A total of 36 potential failure modes were highlighted as high-risk failures and moved to decision trees for further analyses. Conclusion: Developing policy for the familiarization of new personnel designing a checklist for accurate gases counting; drafting comprehensive presurgical posters; preparing all necessary equipment in difficult intubation; developing instruction for monthly checking of the OR equipment; and developing the evaluation criteria of staff performance are examples of solutions that are proposed to improve the quality of OR processes.

TI  - From space to lithosphere: inversion of the GOCE gravity gradients. Supply to the Earth's interior study
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of high resolution satellite measurements of the gravitational field (GOCE mission) offers promising perspectives for the study of the Earth's interior. These new data call for the development of innovant analysis and interpretation methods. Here we combine a forward prism computation with a Bayesian resolution approach to invert for these gravity gradient data configuration. We apply and test our new method on satellite data configuration, that is 225 km height with a global and homogeneous geographic distribution. We first quantify the resolution of our method according to both data and parametrization characteristics. It appears that for reasonable density contrast values (0.1 gcm(-3)) crustal structures have to be wider than similar to 28 km to be detectable in the GOCE signal. Deeper bodies are distinguishable for greater size (35 km size at 50 km depth, similar to 80 km at 300 km depth). We invert the six tensor components, among which five are independent. By carefully testing each of them and their different combinations, we enlighten a trade off between the recovery of data and the sensitivity to inversion parameters. We particularly discussed this characteristic in terms of geometry of the synthetic model tested (structures orientation, 3-D geometry, etc.). In terms of RMS value, each component is always better explained if inverted solely, but the result is strongly affected by the inversion parametrization (smoothing, variances, etc.). On the contrary, the simultaneous inversion of several components displays a significant improvement for the global tensor recovery, more dependent on data than on density variance or on smoothness control. Comparing gravity and gradient inversions, we highlight the superiority of the GG data to better reproduce the structures especially in terms of vertical location. We successfully test our method on a realistic case of a complex subduction case for both gradient and gravity data. While the imaging of small crustal structures requires terrestrial gravity data set, the longest wavelength of the slab is well recovered with both data sets. The precision and homogeneous coverage of GOCE data however, counterbalance the heterogeneous and often quite non-existence coverage of terrestrial gravity data. This is particularly true in large areas which requires a coherent assemblage of heterogeneous data sets, or in high relief, vegetally covered and offshore zones.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of a machine learning cloud identification algorithm for the SLSTR in polar regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A Feed Forward Neural Net (NN) approach to distinguish between clouds and the surface has been applied to the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer in polar regions. The masking algorithm covers the Arctic, Antarctic and regions typically classified as the cryosphere such as northern hemisphere permafrost. The mask has been trained using collocations with the CALIOP active lidar, which in narrow strips provide more accurate detection of cloud, and was subsequently evaluated as a function of cloud type and surface type. The mask was compared with the existing operational Bayesian and Empirical cloud masks by eye and also statistically using CALIOP data. It was found to perform exceptionally well in the polar regions. The Kuiper skill score improved from 0.28, for the operational Bayesian and 0.17 for the Empirical masks to 0.77 for the NN. The NN algorithm also has a much more homogeneous performance over all surface types. The key improvement came from better identification of clear scenes; for the NN mask, the same performance in terms of contamination of cloudy pixels in the sample of identified clear pixels can be achieved while retaining 40% of the clear pixels compared with 10% for the operational cloud identification. The algorithm performed with almost the same skill over sea and land. The best performance was achieved for opaque clouds while transparent and broken clouds showed slightly reduced accuracy.

TI  - SOLVING THE PUZZLE OF THE BIVALVE SHELL FRAGMENT: INFERRING THE ORIGINAL ABUNDANCE AND SIZE FREQUENCY FROM THE FRAGMENTED RECORD
T2  - PALAIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the contribution of bivalves to paleoecology is based on the fraction preserved whole. The use of fragments has been limited by the inability to reconstruct the whole shell. For this study, shells of selected species were broken, metrics obtained for shell reconstruction, and a stepwise model developed and tested to evaluate the potential of reconstructing whole shells from fragments. The model is based on the facts that shell thickness is well correlated with shell length, width, and weight, that fragments can be assigned to shell areas, and that each shell area can be matched to a potential donor shell by combinations of length, width, and weight. Simulations using the model show that shell reconstructions are feasible and that the size frequency can be reconstructed more accurately than the number of shells. if all fragments are preserved, shell number tends to be modestly overestimated. Assuming fragment loss, the shell number estimated will be a conservative estimate of original abundance. Reconstructed size frequencies did not differ significantly from the original size frequencies of the whole shells even if 40% of the fragments were not preserved. Biovolume, consequently, may also be estimable. Standardly, bivalve fragments are enumerated by counting intact umbos. if all fragments are preserved, this approach is preferable, as shell model reconstructions overestimate abundance under that circumstance. However, the expectation that fragments with intact umbos are uniquely well preserved is unrealistic and if fragment loss has occurred, relying on all fragments may provide an improved estimate of the original abundance and, in addition, an estimate of the size frequency and the latter proves to be robust even with 40% of the fragments lost.

TI  - Molecular xenomonitoring of diurnally subperiodic <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i> infection in <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Downsiomyia</i>) <i>niveus</i> (Ludlow, 1903) after nine rounds of Mass Drug Administration in Nancowry Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - A group of four human inhabited Nancowry Islands in Nicobar district in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India having a population of 7674 is the lone focus of diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti (DspWB) that is transmitted by Aedes niveus (Ludlow). Microfilaria (Mf) prevalence was above 1% even after nine rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) with DEC and albendazole. Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) was conducted to identify appropriate vector sampling method and assess the impact. BioGents Sentinel traps, gravid traps and human baited double bed nettraps were used in three locations in each village to collect Aedes niveus female mosquitoes. Subsequently daytime man landing collections (MLC) were carried out in all the 25 villages in the islands. Collections were compared in terms of the number of vector mosquitoes captured per trap collection. Females of Ae. niveus were pooled, dried and processed for detecting filarial parasite DNA using RT-PCR assay. Vector infection rate was estimated using PoolScreen software. Only 393 female mosquitoes including 44 Ae. niveus (11.2%) were collected from 459 trap collections using three trapping devices. From 151 MLCs, 2170 Ae. niveus female mosquitoes were collected. The average prevalence of W. bancrofti DNA was 0.43%. Estimated upper 95% CI exceeded the provisional prevalence threshold of 0.1% in all the villages, indicating continued transmission as observed in Mf survey. MLCs could be the choice, for now, to sample Ae. niveus mosquitoes. The PCR assay used in MX for nocturnally periodic bancroftian filariasis could be adopted for DspWB. The vector-parasite MX, can be used to evaluate interventions in this area after further standardization of the protocol.Author summaryLymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by nematode parasite-Wuchereria bancrofti, is prevalent in 72 countries with about 1.39 billion people facing the risk of infection. In India LF is endemic in 256 districts. A physiological variant of the parasite, the diurnally sub-periodic Wb (DspWb) is confined to a small pocket of four remotely located isles, in Nicobar district in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The parasite is transmitted by a day-biting and forest dwelling mosquito, Aedes niveus. Even after 9 rounds of Mass Drug Administration under the National Programme for LF elimination, microfilaria prevalence was above transmission threshold level (1%), indicating continued transmission. We studied filarial infection in Ae. niveus using molecular xenomonitoring (MX). The vector mosquito was sampled using BioGents Sentinel, Gravid and human baited double bed net-traps. Since the traps did not yield adequate numbers, man landing collections were carried out. The prevalence filarial infection in mosquitoes assessed by molecular assay was above the provisional threshold level (<0.1%.), confirming that the transmission has not been interrupted. MX protocol can further be standardised for use as a surveillance tool in assessing the impact of MDA in this vector-parasite combination.

TI  - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX AND CANOPY TEMPERATURE THAT AFFECTS THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND PHENOMENON
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to analyze the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and canopy temperature that affects the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon in Mueang Maha Sarakham Municipality. The operational methods were divided into three main steps: 1) Analyzing NDVI by using Landsat 8 OLI satellite data 2) Monitoring canopy temperature with mobile traverses installed with digital thermometer and auto-record GPS receiver 3) Analyzing the relationship between NDVI and canopy temperature that passed through the spatial interpolation process using the kriging method. The results of the operational methods indicated that the trend of average atmospheric temperature in the urban area was higher than the outer area. Mueang Maha Sarakham Municipality had the highest UHI in the atmosphere at 4.65 degrees C. And from the buffer zone with a distance of 800 m around the centroid point, the highest UHI in the atmosphere was 5.08 degrees C. From the regression analysis between NDVI and the atmospheric temperature, it could be found a negative relationship between the data with a significance level of 0.01 and the decision coefficient (R-2) of 0.9392. This can be explained that if the area from the buffer zone decreased towards the centroid point, the value of NDVI decreased as well. In addition, when the equation set from the regression analysis was brought to predict the difference in atmospheric temperature in the area of Mueang Maha Sarakham Municipality and the surrounding area, the UHI sizes at all periods (16.00-20.00 hrs.) increased in accordance with the decreases of NDVI values. Meanwhile, considering the tendency between the changes in UHI size in the atmosphere in each period and NDVI values with the polynomial regression analysis (degree 4), it was found that the maximum formation of UHI was during 18.00-19.00 hrs.'. The decreases in NDVI values resulted in a higher UHI size in each period. In addition, when the NDVI values in Mueang Maha Sarakham Municipality were less than 0.302, the largest size of UHI in the atmosphere will change at the time approaching 19.00hrs.

TI  - Monitoring spring phenology in Mediterranean beech populations through <i>in situ</i> observation and Synthetic Aperture Radar methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The interest in tree phenology monitoring is increasing because this trait is a robust indicator of the impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems. Different approaches to monitor phenology at different spatial scales, from in situ monitoring to remote sensing, are used to investigate spring and/or autumn phenological changes. In Mediterranean area, most of phenological changes occur during cloudy periods (spring and autumn), leading to a loss of information also for very high temporal resolution satellites. Instead, cloud-uninfluenced sensors, such as radar sensors, can allow to bypass this problem and produce a temporally continuous coverage.In this paper, we analyzed the spring phenology of two European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations, located at different latitudes in Mediterranean area. Weekly in situ monitoring of leaf-out has been correlated with data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar. Spring phenological phases were monitored in situ following a modified BBCH-code with a 5-scores scale (from 1 buds closed and covered by scales, to 5 leaf completely unfolded). The score 3 (young leaves starting to emerge from the bud) was considered the bud break. Different site conditions based on aspect (northern and southern) and altitudinal gradient (high and low altitude) have been considered. The aim was to test and implement a new methodology able to decrease the frequency of the field sampling, using remote data, to extend more detailed information on geographical scale, and to reconstruct past phenology.Results showed a statistically significant different length of the vegetative spring period, spanning from dormant buds, up to leaves completely unfolded, between sites. Through Synthetic Aperture Radar estimation, this study demonstrates that leaf-out can be monitored with an extreme accuracy. The phenophase score 4 and 5 estimation showed the best performance (RMSE < of 4 days), phenophases score 2 and 3 showed promising performances (4 days < RMSE < 5 days), while phenophases score 1 seems to be not easily detectable, although it can be extrapolated with an RMSE < 6 days.This radar approach fixes the cloud problem typical of multispectral approach and very frequent in phenophase change periods in Mediterranean climate. This study promotes the proposed remote sensing approach as a very useful tool to monitor growing season starting in remote areas, helping to reduce in situ observations and allowing past phenology reconstruction.

TI  - Evaluation of the MODIS LAI/FPAR Algorithm Based on 3D-RTM Simulations: A Case Study of Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty assessment of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) retrieval algorithm can provide a scientific basis for the usage and improvement of this widely-used product. Previous evaluations generally depended on the intercomparison with other datasets as well as direct validation using ground measurements, which mix the uncertainties from the model, inputs, and assessment method. In this study, we adopted the evaluation method based on three-dimensional radiative transfer model (3D RTM) simulations, which helps to separate model uncertainty and other factors. We used the well-validated 3D RTM LESS (large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework) for a grassland scene simulation and calculated bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) as inputs for the LAI/FPAR retrieval. The dependency between LAI/FPAR truth and model estimation serves as the algorithm uncertainty indicator. This paper analyzed the LAI/FPAR uncertainty caused by inherent model uncertainty, input uncertainty (BRF and biome classification), clumping effect, and scale dependency. We found that the uncertainties of different algorithm paths vary greatly (-6.61% and +84.85% bias for main and backup algorithm, respectively) and the "hotspot" geometry results in greatest retrieval uncertainty. For the input uncertainty, the BRF of the near-infrared (NIR) band has greater impacts than that of the red band, and the biome misclassification also leads to nonnegligible LAI/FPAR bias. Moreover, the clumping effect leads to a significant LAI underestimation (-0.846 and -0.525 LAI difference for two clumping types), but the scale dependency (pixel size ranges from 100 m to 1000 m) has little impact on LAI/FPAR uncertainty. Overall, this study provides a new perspective on the evaluation of LAI/FPAR retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Integrating multisource RS data and GIS techniques to assist the evaluation of resource-environment carrying capacity in karst mountainous area
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The karst mountainous area is an ecologically fragile region with prominent human-land contradictions. The resource-environment carrying capacity (RECC) of this region needs to be further clarified. The development of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) provides data sources and processing platform for RECC monitoring. This study analyzed and established the evaluation index system of RECC by considering particularity in the karst mountainous area of Southwest China; processed multisource RS data (Sentinel-2, Aster-DEM and Landsat-8) to extract the spatial distributions of nine key indexes by GIS techniques (information classification, overlay analysis and raster calculation); proposed the methods of index integration and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the RECC by GIS; and took a typical area, Guangnan County in Yunnan Province of China, as an experimental area to explore the effectiveness of the indexes and methods. The results showed that: (1) The important indexes affecting the RECC of karst mountainous area are water resources, tourism resources, position resources, geographical environment and soil erosion environment. (2) Data on cultivated land, construction land, minerals, transportation, water conservancy, ecosystem services, topography, soil erosion and rocky desertification can be obtained from RS data. GIS techniques integrate the information into the RECC results. The data extraction and processing methods are feasible on evaluating RECC. (3) The RECC of Guangnan County was in the mid-carrying level in 2018. The mid-carrying and low-carrying levels were the main types, accounting for more than 80.00% of the total study area. The areas with high carrying capacity were mainly distributed in the northern regions of the northwest-southeast line of the county, and other areas have a low carrying capacity comparatively. The coordination between regional resource-environment status and socioeconomic development is the key to improve RECC. This study explores the evaluation index system of RECC in karst mountainous area and the application of multisource RS data and GIS techniques in the comprehensive evaluation. The methods can be applied in related fields to provide suggestions for data/information extraction and integration, and sustainable development.

TI  - A Near Real-Time Method for Forest Change Detection Based on a Structural Time Series Model and the Kalman Filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of dense time series of earth observation data has incited a growing interest in time series analysis for vegetation monitoring and change detection. Vegetation monitoring algorithms need to deal with several time series characteristics such as seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and signal artefacts. While common algorithms based on deterministic harmonic regression models account for intra-annual seasonality, inter-annual variations of the seasonal pattern related to shifts in vegetation phenology due to different temperature and rainfall are usually not accounted for. We propose a transition to stochastic modelling and present a near real-time change detection method that combines a structural time series model with the Kalman filter. The model continuously adapts to new observations and allows to better separate phenology-related deviations from vegetation anomalies or land cover changes. The method is tested in a forest change detection application aiming at the assessment of damages caused by storm events and insect calamities. Forest changes are detected based on the cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) which is used to decide if new observations deviate from model-based forecasts. The performance is evaluated in two test sites, one in Malawi (dry tropical forest) and one in Austria (temperate deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests) based on Sentinel-2 time series. Both forest areas are characterized by a distinct, but temporally varying leaf-off season. The presented change detection method shows overall accuracies above 99%, users' accuracies of 76.8% to 88.6%, and producers' accuracies of 68.2% to 80.4% for the forest change stratum (minimum mapping unit: 0.1 ha). Results are based on visually interpreted points derived by stratified random sampling. A further analysis revealed that increasing the time series density by merging data from two Sentinel-2 orbits yields better forest change detection accuracies in comparison to using data from one orbit only. The resulting increase in users' accuracy amounts to 7.6%. The presented method is capable of near real-time processing and could be used for a variety of automated forest monitoring applications.

TI  - Glacial Lakes Mapping Using Multi Satellite PlanetScope Imagery and Deep Learning
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes mapping using satellite remote sensing data are important for studying the effects of climate change as well as for the mitigation and risk assessment of a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). The 3U cubesat constellation of Planet Labs offers the capability of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday at 3-4 m spatial resolution. The higher spatial, as well as temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery in comparison with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, makes it a valuable data source for monitoring the glacial lakes. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of the PlanetScope imagery for glacial lakes mapping with a focus on the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKKH) region. Though the revisit time of the PlanetScope imagery is short, courtesy of 130+ small satellites, this imagery contains only four bands and the imaging sensors in these small satellites exhibit varying spectral responses as well as lower dynamic range. Furthermore, the presence of cast shadows in the mountainous regions and varying spectral signature of the water pixels due to differences in composition, turbidity and depth makes it challenging to automatically and reliably extract surface water in PlanetScope imagery. Keeping in view these challenges, this work uses state of the art deep learning models for pixel-wise classification of PlanetScope imagery into the water and background pixels and compares the results with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The deep learning model is based on the popular U-Net architecture. We evaluate U-Net architecture similar to the original U-Net as well as a U-Net with a pre-trained EfficientNet backbone. In order to train the deep neural network, ground truth data are generated by manual digitization of the surface water in PlanetScope imagery with the aid of Very High Resolution Satellite (VHRS) imagery. The created dataset consists of more than 5000 water bodies having an area of approx. 71km2 in eight different sites in the HKKH region. The evaluation of the test data show that the U-Net with EfficientNet backbone achieved the highest F1 Score of 0.936. A visual comparison with the existing glacial lake inventories is then performed over the Baltoro glacier in the Karakoram range. The results show that the deep learning model detected significantly more lakes than the existing inventories, which have been derived from Landsat OLI imagery. The trained model is further evaluated on the time series PlanetScope imagery of two glacial lakes, which have resulted in an outburst flood. The output of the U-Net is also compared with the GLakeMap data. The results show that the higher spatial and temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery is a significant advantage in the context of glacial lakes mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Fusing Multiseasonal Sentinel-2 Imagery for Urban Land Cover Classification With Multibranch Residual Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting multitemporal Sentinel-2 images for urban land cover classification has become an important research topic, since these images have become globally available at relatively fine temporal resolution, thus offering great potential for large-scale land cover mapping. However, appropriate exploitation of the images needs to address problems such as cloud cover inherent to optical satellite imagery. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective decision-level fusion approach for urban land cover prediction from multiseasonal Sentinel-2 images, using the state-of-the-art residual convolutional neural networks (ResNet). We extensively tested the approach in a cross-validation manner over a seven-city study area in central Europe. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed fusion approach over several baseline approaches, including observation- and feature-level fusion.

TI  - Big Data? Statistical Process Control Can Help!
T2  - AMERICAN STATISTICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - "Big data" is a buzzword these days due to an enormous amount of data-rich applications in different industries and research projects. In practice, big data often take the form of data streams in the sense that new batches of data keep being collected over time. One fundamental research problem when analyzing big data in a given application is to monitor the underlying sequential process of the observed data to see whether it is longitudinally stable, or how its distribution changes over time. To monitor a sequential process, one major statistical tool is the statistical process control (SPC) charts, which have been developed and used mainly for monitoring production lines in the manufacturing industries during the past several decades. With many new and versatile SPC methods developed in the recent research, it is our belief that SPC can become a powerful tool for handling many big data applications that are beyond the production line monitoring. In this article, we introduce some recent SPC methods, and discuss their potential to solve some big data problems. Certain challenges in the interface between the current SPC research and some big data applications are also discussed.

TI  - Deriving Annual Double-Season Cropland Phenology Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland phenology provides key information in managing agricultural practices and modelling crop yield. However, most of the existing phenological products have coarse spatial resolution ranging from 250 to 8000 m, which is not sufficient to capture the critical spatial details of cropland phenology at the landscape scale. Landsat imagery provides an unprecedented data source to generate 30-m spatial resolution phenological products. This paper explored the potential of utilizing multi-year Landsat enhanced vegetation index to derive annual phenological metrics of a double-season agricultural land from 1993 to 2009 in a sub-urban area of Shanghai, China. We used all available Landsat TM and ETM+ observations (538 scenes) and developed a Landsat double-cropping phenology (LDCP) algorithm. LDCP captures the temporal trajectory of multi-year enhanced vegetation index time series very well, with the degree of fitness ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 over the study regions. We found good agreements between derived annual phenological metrics and in situ observation, with root mean square error ranging from 8.74 to 18.04 days, indicating that the proposed LDCP is capable of detecting double-season cropland phenology. LDCP could reveal the spatial heterogeneity of cropland phenology at parcel scales. Phenology metrics were retrieved for approximately one-third and two-thirds of the 17 years for the first and second cropping cycles, respectively, depending on the number of good quality Landsat data. In addition, we found an advanced peak of season for both cropping cycles in 50-60% of the study area, and a delayed start of season for the second cropping cycle in 50-70% of the same area. The potential drivers of those trends might be climate warming and changes in agricultural practices. The derived cropland phenology can be used to help estimate historical crop yields at Landsat spatial resolution, providing insights on evaluating the effects of climate change on temporal variations of crop growth, and contributing to food security policy making.

TI  - Active Tectonics of the Frontal Himalayas: An Example from the Manzai Ranges in the Recess Setting, Western Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan main frontal thrust (MFT) accommodates most of the present-day Indo-Asia convergence with related periodic earthquakes. The seismicity and deformation mechanism varies considerably across the frontal Himalayas. We mapped a segment (Manzai Ranges) of the MFT at the western margin of the Himalayas and analyzed its deformation mechanism and active tectonics using geomorphic indices and the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique. Two frontal thrust faults (Khirgi and Jandola) were mapped using Sentinel-2B band ratios in the study area. Water gaps were present in the form of deflected streams at the tip of the growing anticlines. The C-band RADAR interferometry (Sentinel-1A) showed an average uplift of 5-9 mm/year in the satellite line of sight (LOS) from May 2018 to October 2019. The velocity profiles show an uplift variation across the anticlines and may be related to the displacement transfer from the zone of compression in the Manzai Ranges to the zone of transpression in the Pezu-Bhittani Ranges. Four types of morphometric analyses were carried out to assess the relative tectonic activity, namely mountain front sinuosity index (Smf), valley floor width to height ratio (V-f), normalized longitudinal river profile, and normalized channel steepness index (Ksn). The landscape response to active tectonics in the study area was recorded as a deep fluvial incision in V-shaped valleys, convex river profiles, topographic breaks as knickpoints, and a high Ksn index. The geomorphic parameters show a relative increase in tectonic uplift and deformation from the Kundi anticline to the Khirgi and Manzai anticline. We concluded that the frontal structures in the western Himalayas are still going through an active phase of deformation and landscape development with both seismic and aseismic creep.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 25th Topical Meeting of the International-Society-of-Electrochemistry (ISE)
CL  - Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fabrica Armas, Toledo, SPAIN
AB  - The chemical contamination of terrestrial ecosystems is a great concern as these ecosystems are the target of most of the pollutants derived from anthropogenic activities such as pesticides, heavy metals, nanoparticles, and others. Terrestrial gastropods are considered to be excellent sentinel organisms for biological monitoring of environmental pollution, as they have the ability to accumulate chemicals in their tissues and exhibit a great potential to evaluate the ecological effects of pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems. The use of biomarkers as sensitive parameters to estimate the exposure or resulting effects of chemicals have received considerable attention. The successful biomarker must be applicable in the laboratory and field conditions. Many biomarkers have been examined to understand the adverse effects of pollutants. In this review, we shed light on different types of biomarkers, such as oxidative stress, genotoxicity and immunotoxicity as diagnostic tools for monitoring the impacts of pollution. These biomarkers can provide information about early detection and quantification of these impacts during their initial manifestations and can facilitate the implementation of a rapid preventive and/or restorative responses in the affected ecosystems, as well as single or multiple biomarkers can be integrated into routine monitoring programs.

TI  - Accuracy of One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification in Detecting Lymph Node Metastases in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is used to intraoperatively detect sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer. OSNA has also been proposed in endometrial cancer, but evidence in this regard is unclear to define the diagnostic accuracy of OSNA in detecting lymph node metastases in endometrial cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching 8 electronic databases from their inception to March 2019 for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of OSNA in detecting sentinel lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer. Pathologic ultrastaging was the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+ and LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and area under the curve (AUC) on SROC curve were calculated. Four studies with 237 patients and 691 lymph nodes were included. OSNA showed sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.93, LR + =17.95, LR- = 0.15, DOR = 191.23 and high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.959). OSNA appears as a highly accurate tool for intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph node in endometrial cancer.

TI  - Identifying sources of dust aerosol using a new framework based on remote sensing and modelling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust particles are transported globally. Dust storms can adversely impact both human health and the environment, but they also impact transportation infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, occasionally severely. The identification of the locations that are the primary sources of dust, especially in arid and semi-arid environments, remains a challenge as these sites are often in remote or data-scarce regions. In this study, a new method using state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms - random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) - was evaluated for its ability to spatially model the distribution of dust-source potential in eastern Iran. To accomplish this, empirically identified dust-source locations were determined with the ozone monitoring instrument aerosol index and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue aerosol optical thickness methods. The identified areas were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Measurements of the conditioning factors (lithology, wind speed, maximum air temperature, land use, slope angle, soil, rainfall, and land cover) were compiled for the study area and predictive models were developed. The area-under-the-receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and true-skill statistics (TSS) were used to validate the maps of the models' predictions. The results show that the RF algorithm performed best (AUC = 89.4% and TSS = 0.751), followed by the SVM (AUC = 87.5%, TSS = 0.73) and the MARS algorithm (AUC = 81%, TSS = 0.69). The results of the RF indicated that wind speed and land cover are the most important factors affecting dust generation. The region of highest dust-source potential that was identified by the RF is in the eastern parts of the study region. This model can be applied to other arid and semi-arid environments that experience dust storms to promote management that prevents desertification and reduces dust production. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphometry is a tool to search for groundwater resources through the studies of various landforms and drainage system. The drainage pattern is an important prerequisite in evaluating the basin hydrology through the knowledge of morphometric parameters. The system of streaming wherein the water reaches the streams is dependent upon the morphometric characteristics of the basin. The extracted drainage network was classified according to Strahler's system and it reveals that the basin exhibits dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. The Jilledubanderu River Basin is sprawled over an area of 486.95 km(2) and forms a part of the Chitravathi River system. The study area is designated as sixth-order basin and lower order streams mostly dominate the basin with the average drainage density of 1.96 km/km(2). The slope of basin varies from 0 degrees to >35 degrees and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles. The elongation ratio value is 0.66 indicating the basin has elongated shape with moderate relief and steep slopes. The drainage texture of the basin is 5.69 which indicate an intermediate texture that exists over the region. Hence, from the study, it can be concluded that remote sensing data (SRTM-DEM) coupled with geospatial techniques prove to be a competent tool in morphometric analysis and the data can be used for basin management and other hydrological studies in future.

TI  - A novel method of satellite based river discharge estimation using river hydraulic geometry through genetic algorithm technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries experiences floods due to heavy flows carried by trans-boundary Rivers. Hydrological modelling in un-gauged catchments and trans-boundary Rivers has become a challenging task for hydrological modellers. This research aims at estimating river discharges computed solely using satellite images, with no ground-based or a prior information at all. It is also aimed at testing the applicability of approach in very well defined channel to braided channels and in very wide range of discharge conditions. The approach works owing to principle of hydraulic geometry of natural rivers. Monitoring these discharges in upstream areas will help in forecasting flows in the downstream areas. In this paper, an attempt is made to estimate the river discharge using river flow width information derived from temporal satellite remote sensing data alone. The approach is based on Many Stations Hydraulic Geometry (AMHG) principle through Genetic Algorithm Technique. The technique is demonstrated in four major rivers in India for various discharge values using temporal remote sensing data of Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) and LANDSAT. Computed discharges are validated with observed discharges in all the identified river reaches using statistical method and found to have very good match. This novel approach is useful globally for quantifying river discharges with continuous imaging of the rivers and has strong advantage in flood early warning and water resources assessment.

TI  - A Trend Analysis of Leaf Area Index and Land Surface Temperature and Their Relationship from Global to Local Scale
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the way in which vegetation phenology mediates the feedback of vegetation to climate systems is now well understood, the magnitude of these changes is still unknown. A thorough understanding of how the recent shift in phenology may impact on, for example, land surface temperature (LST) is important. To address this knowledge gap, it is important to quantify these impacts and identify patterns from the global to the regional scale. This study examines the trend and linear regression modeling of the leaf area index (LAI) and LST derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, specifically to assess their spatial distribution and changing trends at the continental and regional scales. The change detection analysis of interannual variability in the global LAI and LST between two periods (2003-2010 and 2011-2018) demonstrates more positive LAI trends than negative, while for LST most changes were not significant. The relationships between LAI and LST were assessed across the continents to ascertain the response of vegetation to changes in LST. The regression between LAI and LST was negative in Australia (R-2 = 0.487 ***), positive but minimal in Africa (R-2 = 0.001), positive in North America (R-2 = 0.641 ***), negative in Central America (R-2 = 0.119), positive in South America (R-2 = 0.253 *) and positive in Europe (R-2 = 0.740 ***). Medium temperatures enhance photosynthesis and lengthen the growing season in Europe. We also found a significant greening trend in China (trendp = 0.16 ***) and India (trendp = 0.13 ***). The relationships between LAI and LST in these most prominent greening countries of the world are R-2 = 0.06 and R-2 = 0.25 for China and India, respectively. Our deductions here are twofold-(1) In China, an insignificant association appeared between greening trend and temperature. (2) In India, the significant greening trend may be a factor in lowering temperatures. Therefore, temperature may stabilize if the greening trend continues. We attribute the trends in both countries to the different land use management and climate mitigation policies adopted by these countries.

TI  - People-centred surveillance: a narrative review of community-based surveillance among crisis-affected populations
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Outbreaks of disease in settings affected by crises grow rapidly due to late detection and weakened public health systems. Where surveillance is underfunctioning, community-based surveillance can contribute to rapid outbreak detection and response, a core capacity of the International Health Regulations. We reviewed articles describing the potential for community-based surveillance to detect diseases of epidemic potential, outbreaks, and mortality among populations affected by crises. Surveillance objectives have included the early warning of outbreaks, active case finding during outbreaks, case finding for eradication programmes, and mortality surveillance. Community-based surveillance can provide sensitive and timely detection, identify valid signals for diseases with salient symptoms, and provide continuity in remote areas during cycles of insecurity. Effectiveness appears to be mediated by operational requirements for continuous supervision of large community networks, verification of a large number of signals, and integration of community-based surveillance within the routine investigation and response infrastructure. Similar to all community health systems, community-based surveillance requires simple design, reliable supervision, and early and routine monitoring and evaluation to ensure data validity. Research priorities include the evaluation of syndromic case definitions, electronic data collection for community members, sentinel site designs, and statistical techniques to counterbalance false positive signals.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability in Phytoplankton Bloom Phenology in Eastern Canadian Lakes Related to Physiographic, Morphologic, and Climatic Drivers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton bloom monitoring in freshwaters is a challenging task, particularly when biomass is dominated by buoyant cyanobacterial communities that present complex spatiotemporal patterns. Increases in bloom frequency or intensity and their earlier onset in spring were shown to be linked to multiple anthropogenic disturbances, including climate change. The aim of the present study was to describe the phenology of phytoplankton blooms and its potential link with morphological, physiographic, anthropogenic, and climatic characteristics of the lakes and their watershed. The spatiotemporal dynamics of near-surface blooms were studied on 580 lakes in southern Quebec (Eastern Canada) over a 17-year period by analyzing chlorophyll-a concentrations gathered from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images. Results show a significant increase by 23% in bloom frequency across all studied lakes between 2000 and 2016. The first blooms of the year appeared increasingly early over this period but only by 3 days (median date changing from 6 June to 3 June). Results also indicate that high biomass values are often reached, but the problem is seldom extended to the entire lake surface. The canonical correlation analysis between phenological variables and environmental variables shows that higher frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms and earlier onset date occurred for smaller watersheds and higher degree-days, lake surface area, and proportion of urban zones. This study provides a regional picture of lake trophic state over a wide variety of lacustrine environments in Quebec, a detailed phenology allowing to go beyond local biomass assessments, and the first steps on the development of an approach exploiting regional trends for local pattern assessments.

TI  - Integrating C- and L-Band SAR Imagery for Detailed Flood Monitoring of Remote Vegetated Areas
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood detection and monitoring is increasingly important, especially on remote areas such as African tropical river basins, where ground investigations are difficult. We present an experiment aimed at integrating multi-temporal and multi-source data from the Sentinel-1 and ALOS 2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, operating in C band, VV polarization, and L band, HH and HV polarizations, respectively. Information from the globally available CORINE land cover dataset, derived over Africa from the Proba V satellite, and available publicly at the resolution of 100 m, is also exploited. Integrated multi-frequency, multi-temporal, and multi-polarizations analysis allows highlighting different drying dynamics for floodwater over various land cover classes, such as herbaceous vegetation, wetlands, and forests. They also enable detection of different scattering mechanisms, such as double bounce interaction of vegetation stems and trunks with underlying floodwater, giving precious information about the distribution of flooded areas among the different ground cover types present on the site. The approach is validated through visual analysis from Google Earth imagery. This kind of integrated analysis, exploiting multi-source remote sensing to partially make up for the unavailability of reliable ground truth, is expected to assume increasing importance as constellations of satellites, observing the Earth in different electromagnetic radiation bands, will be available.

TI  - A comprehensive dataset of vegetation states, fluxes of matter and energy, weather, agricultural management, and soil properties from intensively monitored crop sites in western Germany
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The development and validation of hydroecological land-surface models to simulate agricultural areas require extensive data on weather, soil properties, agricultural management, and vegetation states and fluxes. However, these comprehensive data are rarely available since measurement, quality control, documentation, and compilation of the different data types are costly in terms of time and money. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset, which was collected at four agricultural sites within the Rur catchment in western Germany in the framework of the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 32 (TR32) "Patterns in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Systems: Monitoring, Modeling and Data Assimilation". Vegetation-related data comprise fresh and dry biomass (green and brown, predominantly per organ), plant height, green and brown leaf area index, phenological development state, nitrogen and carbon content (overall > 17 000 entries), and masses of harvest residues and regrowth of vegetation after harvest or before planting of the main crop (> 250 entries). Vegetation data including LAI were collected in frequencies of 1 to 3 weeks in the years 2015 until 2017, mostly during overflights of the Sentinel 1 and Radarsat 2 satellites. In addition, fluxes of carbon, energy, and water (> 180 000 half-hourly records) measured using the eddy covariance technique are included. Three flux time series have simultaneous data from two different heights. Data on agricultural management include sowing and harvest dates as well as information on cultivation, fertilization, and agrochemicals (27 management periods). The dataset also includes gap-filled weather data (> 200 000 hourly records) and soil parameters (particle size distributions, carbon and nitrogen content; > 800 records). These data can also be useful for development and validation of remote-sensing products. The dataset is hosted at the TR32 database (https://www.tr32db.uni-koeln.de/data.php?dataID=1889, last access: 29 September 2020) and has the DOI https://doi.org/10.5880/TR32DB.39 (Reichenau et al., 2020).

TI  - Calculating vertical deformation using a single InSAR pair based on singular value decomposition in mining areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical deformation estimation can be a significant tool in preventing geological hazards and managing environment impacts of underground mining. Common ground surface vertical deformation calculations are challenged by difficult data collection and dependence on prior knowledge. SVD (singular value decomposition) method was applied to estimate ground surface vertical deformation from single pair SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data in a mining region. During the study, LOS (line of sight) and azimuth displacement was obtained using two pass D-InSAR (differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar) and MAI (multi-aperture radar interferometry) technology, respectively. Two adjustment equations were composed using the imaging geometry of D-InSAR and MAI. The singular value decomposition theorem was used to acquire M-P (Moore-Penrose) generalized inverse of the rank deficiency coefficient matrix. From this, the optimal approximation solution of unknown parameters was calculated using weighted least squares. A working panel in the Datong mining area, Shanxi province, China, was selected to verify the SVD approach using the two ascending Sentinel-1A data. The accuracy of vertical deformation estimated by SVD approach is reliable. The RMSE (root mean square error) of vertical deformation is 2.64 mm (along upright profile) and 4.95 mm (along horizontal profile). These results suggest that the SVD approach will complement widely used vertical ground surface deformation calculations. Further study is needed to validate the method from other deformation scenarios from landslides, groundwater loss, earthquakes, underground mining, and glacier movement.

TI  - Harmonizing the Landsat Ground Reference with the Sentinel-2 Global Reference Image Using Space-Based Bundle Adjustment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an ever-increasing need to use an accurate and consistent geometric ground reference in the processing of remotely sensed data products, as this reduces the burden on the end-users to account for the differences between the data products from different missions. In this regard, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated an effort to harmonize the Landsat ground reference with the Sentinel-2 Global Reference Image (GRI) to improve the co-registration between the data products of the two global medium-resolution missions. In this paper, we discuss the process, results, and the improvements expected from this harmonization of two ground references using space-triangulation-based bundle adjustment techniques. The ground coordinates of the Landsat reference library, consisting of five million Ground Control Points (GCPs) were adjusted in a series of four simultaneous bundle block adjustments using thousands of Landsat-8 (L8) scenes anchored with more than 300,000 control points extracted from the GRI dataset. The net adjustments to each of the four blocks, namely, Australia, Americas, Eurasia, and Islands, varied anywhere from 1 to 13 m, depending on the accuracy of the GCPs in these blocks. The use of the GRI dataset in our bundle adjustment not only improved the absolute accuracy of the Landsat ground reference, but will also improve the co-registration between Sentinel-2 and Landsat terrain corrected products, as the European Space Agency plans to process the Sentinel-2 products using the GRI dataset. Independent validation of the Landsat products processed using harmonized GCPs with the GRI dataset indicated a global misregistration error of less than 8 m Circular Error Probable at 90 % (CE90), an improvement from the 25 m prior to harmonization. The improvements to the Landsat products using the harmonized GCPs are expected to be available to the public as part of Landsat Collection-2 processing by the end of 2020.

TI  - Head-to-head comparison of the hybrid tracer indocyanine green-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-nanocolloid with<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Senti-Scint using sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography combined with computer tomography in melanoma
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid has been introduced for sentinel node imaging. However, until now, a comparison of this tracer with other radiocolloids with a larger particle size has not been effectuated. Based on a head-to-head evaluation in patients with melanoma, we have compared ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (particle size 5-80 nm) with(99m)Tc-Senti-Scint (particle size 100-600 nm) to establish differences in drainage pattern and sentinel node localization using lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography combined with computer tomography (SPECT-CT) in melanoma patients scheduled for sentinel node biopsy. Methods Twenty-five patients (mean age: 56.9 years, range: 25-79 years) with a melanoma scheduled for SLN biopsy prior to (re)excision of the primary lesion (scar) were prospectively included following a two-day procedure. The first day, after(99m)Tc-Senti-Scint injection in four intradermal depots around the primary lesion or scar, early/delayed lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT images were acquired. The injection sites were marked. The second day, after assessing lymph node radioactivity using planar scintigraphy, ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid was injected at the previously marked skin points and imaging was performed. The paired planar and SPECT-CT images of both tracers were evaluated with respect to drainage patterns, SLN visualization and non-SLN appearing. Results Twenty-four out of 25 patients were evaluable. SLN visualization on a patient basis was 100% for ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and 96% for(99m)Tc-Senti-Scint, whereas uptake in non-SLNs was found in, respectively, 71% (17/24) and 61% (14/23). Concordance in drainage to 45 lymph node basins was 91%. Discordant drainage was found for two melanomas in the head-and-neck and one in the clavicular area. Unique lymph node basins were seen in 44/45 (98%) for ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid and 42/45 (93%) for(99m)Tc-Senti-Scint. Concerning identified SLNs, the number was similar for both tracers (n = 58); however, more non-SLNs (65 vs 50) were visualized with ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid than with(99m)Tc-Senti-Scint. Conclusion A slightly higher SLN visualization accompanied by a tendency to depict more non-SLNs was found for ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Excepting the head and neck area, an overall high concordance in drainage was found for both radiotracers. With an additional value for the hybrid tracer due to the combination of preoperative imaging and the additional visual signal in the operation room, added by the fluorescent component of the hybrid tracer, there was a preference for ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess Urban Heat Island (UHI) as Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) of Karachi which ensures the existence of UHI effect on sustainability, based on the analysis of rapid urbanization and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes on the average temperature warming in Karachi. Satellite images are employed to extract statistics regarding land-use in Karachi city and to obtain land surface temperature (LST) maps for the year 2009 and 2017. LULC map is obtained by applying a supervised classification technique to detect the changes in impervious areas. Maps of daytime surface temperature are retrieved from the thermal band of Landsat images and nighttime LST is extracted from the MODIS. The Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) is analyzed to indicate persistent zones. It is found that built-up areas are increased by 40% and the vacant areas are decreased at a huge rate within study period of 8 years, whereas the intensity of UHI is increased by 0.04 degrees C. The LULC changes play vital role in the variation of surface temperature along with a spatial distribution pattern of UHI. Regression analysis is also carried out to examine the relationship of LST with impervious areas.

TI  - Uncertainties in Ocean Latent Heat Flux Variations over Recent Decades in Satellite-Based Estimates and Reduced Observation Reanalyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Four state-of-the-art satellite-based estimates of ocean surface latent heat fluxes (LHFs) extending over three decades are analyzed, focusing on the interannual variability and trends of near-global averages and regional patterns. Detailed intercomparisons are made with other datasets including 1) reduced observation reanalyses (RedObs) whose exclusion of satellite data renders them an important independent diagnostic tool; 2) a moisture budget residual LHF estimate using reanalysis moisture transport, atmospheric storage, and satellite precipitation; 3) the ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5); 4) Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) single-sensor passive microwave and scatterometer wind speed retrievals; and 5) several sea surface temperature (SST) datasets. Large disparities remain in near-global satellite LHF trends and their regional expression over the 1990-2010 period, during which time the interdecadal Pacific oscillation changed sign. The budget residual diagnostics support the smaller RedObs LHF trends. The satellites, ERA5, and RedObs are reasonably consistent in identifying contributions by the 10-m wind speed variations to the LHF trend patterns. However, contributions by the near-surface vertical humidity gradient from satellites and ERA5 trend upward in time with respect to the RedObs ensemble and show less agreement in trend patterns. Problems with wind speed retrievals from Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder satellite sensors, excessive upward trends in trends in Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST AVHRR-Only) data used in most satellite LHF estimates, and uncertainties associated with poor satellite coverage before the mid-1990s are noted. Possibly erroneous trends are also identified in ERA5 LHF associated with the onset of scatterometer wind data assimilation in the early 1990s.

TI  - Influence of Different Satellite Imagery on the Analysis of Riparian Leaf Density in a Mountain Stream
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, technological advancements in sensors have generated increasing interest in remote sensing data for the study of vegetation features. Image pixel resolution can affect data analysis and results. This study evaluated the potential of three satellite images of differing resolution (Landsat 8, 30 m; Sentinel-2, 10 m; and Pleiades 1A, 2 m) in assessing the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of riparian vegetation in two Mediterranean streams, and in both a winter wheat field and a deciduous forest used to compare the accuracy of the results. In this study, three different retrieval methods-the Caraux-Garson, the Lambert-Beer, and the Campbell and Norman equations-are used to estimate LAI from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). To validate sensor data, LAI values were measured in the field using the LAI 2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer. The statistical indices showed a better performance for Pleiades 1A and Landsat 8 images, the former particularly in sites characterized by high canopy closure, such as deciduous forests, or in areas with stable riparian vegetation, the latter where stable reaches of riparian vegetation cover are almost absent or very homogenous, as in winter wheat fields. Sentinel-2 images provided more accurate results in terms of the range of LAI values. Considering the different types of satellite imagery, the Lambert-Beer equation generally performed best in estimating LAI from the NDVI, especially in areas that are geomorphologically stable or have a denser vegetation cover, such as deciduous forests.

TI  - Connection as Country: Relational values of billabongs in Indigenous northern Australia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Relational values have recently emerged in the sustainability and ecosystem valuation literature as a way to capture the diversity of human-ecosystem relationships. Relational values have been defined as preferences, principles and virtues about human-nature relationships. We describe participatory action research that aimed to elucidate the values associated with freshwater billabongs by Indigenous people in the Ngukurr community in the South East Arnhem land Indigenous Protected Area, northern Australia. Interviews with senior Indigenous knowledge holders revealed that values were strongly relational, i.e. relationships between people, and between people and Country and the inherent reciprocity of these relationships were important. We developed the "Connection as Country" framework towards conceptualising and understanding the relational values of Country from an Indigenous worldview. The "Connection as Country" framework encompasses four domains: spirituality, reciprocal kinship, knowledge and education and cultural subsistence. Broader and contextualised under-standings of reciprocal human-ecosystem relationships is required for greater inclusion of Indigenous values in science-policy processes.

TI  - Positron Emission Tomography in Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryThere is currently no consensus on a widely accepted algorithm for imaging Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patients. Baseline, tomographic imaging is not generally recommended in early-stage disease, but its value in locally advanced and/or distant metastatic MCC has been well established. In this context, the hybrid imaging modality positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly applied in the workup of metastatic or unresectable MCC, providing essential information for staging, restaging, and treatment monitoring of the disease. Although the role of PET/CT in the management of loco-regional MCC is still limited and less well-defined, current evidence suggests its important contribution also in cases of localized MCC. Herein, we provide a structured literature review summarizing the most important studies on the role of PET or PET/CT with different radiopharmaceuticals in the clinical care of MCC.Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine skin malignancy usually arising as a nonspecific nodule on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Given the poor prognosis of this aggressive tumor, assessment of disease burden in pre- and post-treatment care may ensure an optimal management with significant implications for patient surveillance and prognosis. Although imaging has established its role in locally advanced or distant metastatic MCC, a standard imaging algorithm is yet to be determined and respective recommendations are mainly based on melanoma. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly evolving as a valuable imaging tool in metastatic or unresectable MCC, mostly utilizing the glucose analogue F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) as a radiotracer. Despite being inferior in detecting the disease in its early stages compared to the "gold standard" of sentinel lymph node biopsy, recent evidence suggests an important role for F-18-FDG PET/CT in the routine workup of localized MCC. Moreover, Ga-68-labeled somatostatin analogues have been employed as PET tracers in the field of MCC with promising, yet comparable to F-18-FDG, results. This article provides a structured literature review of the most important studies investigating the role of PET or PET/CT in the clinical practice of MCC.

TI  - Evaluation of land subsidence in Kashmar-Bardaskan plain, NE Iran
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of agriculture and industry and the increase of population in countries with arid to semi-arid climates have led to more harvesting of groundwater resources and as a result land subsidence in different parts of the worlds. Decades of groundwater overexploitation in the Kashmar-Bardaskan plain in the north-east of Iran has resulted substantial land subsidence in this plain. The plain is considered as an arid to semi-arid zone and facing a negative water balance. The average annual precipitation in the plain is around 191 mm and the evaporation rate is 3956 mm. According to the unit hydrograph of the plain, the annual decline of water level is 1.12 m. In this study, the velocity of subsidence has been determined using Interferometric SAR technique (In-SAR) and radar images of Envisat ASAR and Sentinel-1 for a time period from 2003 to 2017. The results of an InSAR time series analysis indicated that an area of 1200 km(2) with different speeds of 5 to 26 cm/year in the satellite line of sight (LOS) is subsiding. The results showed that in addition to the decline of groundwater level, subsurface conditions such as sediments types (fine-grained layers) and their thickness also affect the occurrence and amount of land subsidence.

TI  - Improved Estimations of Nitrate and Sediment Concentrations Based on SWAT Simulations and Annual Updated Land Cover Products from a Deep Learning Classification Algorithm
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural sector and natural resources are heavily interdependent, comprising a coherent but complex system. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) is widely used in assessing these interdependencies for regional watershed management. However, long-term simulations of agricultural watersheds are considered as not realistic since they have often been performed assuming constant land use over time and are based on the coarse resolution of the existing global or national data. This work presents the first insights of the synergy among SWAT model and deep learning classification algorithms to provide annually updated and realistic model's parameterization and simulations. The proposed hybrid modelling approach couples the physical process SWAT model with the versatility of Earth observation data-driven non-linear deep learning algorithms for land use classification (Overall Accuracy (OA) = 79.58% and Kappa = 0.79), giving a strong advantage to decision makers for efficient management planning. A validation case at an agricultural watershed located in Northern Greece is provided to demonstrate their synergistic use to estimate nitrate and sediment concentrations that load in Zazari Lake. The SWAT model has been implemented under two different simulations; one with the use of a static coarse land use map and the other with the use of the annual updated land use maps for three consecutive years (2017-2019). The results indicate that the land use changes affect the final estimations resulting to an enhanced prediction performance of 1% and 2% for sediment and nitrate, respectively, when the annual land use maps are incorporated into SWAT simulations. In this context, a hybrid approach could further contribute to addressing challenges and support a data-centric scheme for informed decision making with regard to environmental and agricultural issues on the river basin scale.

TI  - Spatial lag effect of aridity and nitrogen deposition on Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) damage
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a widespread tolerant forest tree-species; however, its adaptability to environmental change differs among sites with various buffering capacity. In this study, we compared the spatial effects of aridity index (AI) and nitrogen deposition (ND) on biomass density in natural and man-made pine stands of differing soil fertility using geographically weighted multiple lag regression. Soil fertility was defined using soil series as zonal trophic (27.9%), acidic (48.2%), gleyed (15.2%) and as azonal exposed (2.5%), maple (2.4%), ash (0.8%), wet (2.1%) and peat (0.9%) under pine stands in the Czech Republic (Central Europe; 4290.5 km(2); 130-1298 m a.s.l.). Annual AI and ND in every pine stand were estimated by intersection between raster and vector from 1 x 1 km grid for years 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010 of severe non-specific forest damage spread. Biomass density was obtained from a MODIS 250 x 250 m raster using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for years 2000-2015, with a decrease in EVI indicating non-specific damage. Environmental change was assessed by comparing predictor values at EVI time t and t+lambda. Non-specific damage was registered over 51.9% of total forest area. Less than 8.8% of damaged stands were natural and the rest (91.2%) of damaged stands were man-made. Pure pine stands were more damaged than mixed. The ND effect prevailed up to 2007, while AI dominated later. Temporal increasing ND effect under AI effectiveness led to the most significant pine stand damage in 2008 and 2014. Predictors from 2000 to 2007 afflicted 58.5% of non-specifically damaged stands at R-2 0.09-0.76 (median 0.38), but from 2000 to 2010 afflicted 57.1% of the stands at R-2 0.16-0.75 (median 0.40). The most damaged stands occurred on acidic sites. Mixed forest and sustainable management on natural sites seem as effective remediation reducing damage by ND. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimation of Deformation Intensity above a Flooded Potash Mine Near Berezniki (Perm Krai, Russia) with SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we used RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data for measuring subsidence above a flooded potash mine, which is almost entirely located within the city of Berezniki (Perm Krai, Russia), population 150,000. This area has experienced very fast subsidence since October 2006 when the integrity of the Berezniki-1 mine was compromised, resulting in water intrusion, subsequent flooding and closure of the mine. Due to the ongoing dissolution of carnallite, subsidence in this region is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. In addition to rapid subsidence, at least five sinkholes have formed in the region, with the largest being 440 x 320 m. We observed ground subsidence during the period October 2011-April 2014 (RADARSAT-2) with a vertical rate up to 14 cm/year and horizontal rate up to 10 cm/year; during the period July 2016-June 2020 (Sentinel-1) with a vertical rate up to 17 cm/year. Our results were validated by precise leveling, with a coefficient of correlation of 0.75. Subsidence faster than 17 cm/year observed by precise leveling was not resolvable with Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR). Our results show the complementary nature of ground-based and space-borne measurement techniques. The precise leveling captures subsidence along profile lines with high precision but lower temporal resolution, while DInSAR captures subsidence with high spatial and temporal resolutions but with lower precision. DInSAR is also significantly affected by decorrelation outside of urban areas. An important advantage of our methodology is the ability to measure the horizontal east component of the ground deformation when both, ascending and descending, data are available. This measurement directly characterizes the level of anthropogenic load on buildings and infrastructure. We recommend continuing monitoring subsidence using both measurement techniques, which can also be complemented by continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).

TI  - Solar Energy Transformation Strategies by Ecosystems of the Boreal Zone (Thermodynamic Analysis Based on Remote Sensing Data)
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hypothesis of an increase in free energy (exergy) by ecosystems during evolution is tested on direct measurements. As a measuring system of thermodynamic parameters (exergy, information, entropy), a series of measurements of reflected solar radiation in bands of Landsat multispectral imagery for 20 years is used. The thermodynamic parameters are compared for different types of ecosystems depending on the influx of solar radiation, weather conditions and the composition of communities. It is shown that maximization of free energy occurs only in a succession series (time scale of several hundred years), and on a short evolutionary time scale of several thousand years, various strategies of energy use are successfully implemented at the same time: forests always maximize exergy and, accordingly, transpiration, meadows-disequilibrium and biological productivity in summer, and swamps, due to a prompt response to changes in temperature and moisture, maintaining disequilibrium and productivity throughout the year. On the basis of the obtained regularities, we conclude that on an evolutionary time scale, the thermodynamic system changes in the direction of increasing biological productivity and saving moisture, which contradicts the hypothesis of maximizing free energy in the course of evolution.

TI  - Geographic structuring of Antarctic penguin populations
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We hypothesized that regional spatial organization of Antarctic penguin breeding populations was affected by social factors, that is, proximity and size of adjacent colonies, and by physical factors, that is, availability of breeding habitat and proximity of polynyas and submarine canyons where prey is abundant. The hypothesis of Furness and Birkhead (1984), that forage competition and density-dependence affect geographic structure of seabird populations, was tested previously for Antarctic penguins when biologging to quantify colony foraging areas was less common and when assessments of colony size reflected a compendium of historical counts. These data on foraging areas and colony size are now available following 20 years of frequent biologging and real-time satellite data on colony locations and sizes. Location Antarctica. Major taxa studied Penguin species. Time period Present day. Methods We prepared a literature summary on the basis of biologging studies to improve assessment of foraging ranges. We collated colony sizes from recent sources and integrated them with data on submarine canyon systems and polynyas. We used geospatial models to assess the relationships of the latter features to colony size, clustering, and distribution around Antarctica. Results The equal spacing of emperor penguin colonies was constant, with spacing a function of foraging range. In contrast, colonies of other penguin species were clustered, with small colonies adjacent to one another and within the outer edge of the foraging area of large colonies. Colonies and especially clusters occurred near polynyas and canyons around Antarctica. Main conclusions Density-dependent processes and geography explained penguin colony distribution. We conclude that inter- and intraspecific trophic competition affects the geographic structuring of colony distribution and size, although not necessarily in the same way among species. Results are relevant to assessing effects of climate, ecosystem dynamics, fisheries and other factors on penguin population trends at regional scales. We suggest that considering penguin colony distribution and abundance at the regional or cluster level is necessary to understand changes in these attributes.

TI  - Multiple Non-Species-Specific Pathogens Possibly Triggered the Mass Mortality in <i>Pinna nobilis</i>
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The fan mussel, Pinna nobilis, represents the largest bivalve endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Since 2016, dramatic mass mortality of this species has been observed in several areas. The first surveys suggested that Haplosporidium pinnae (currently considered species-specific) was the main etiological agent, but recent studies have indicated that a multifactorial disease may be responsible for this phenomenon. In this study, we performed molecular diagnostic analyses on P. nobilis, P. rudis, and bivalve heterologous host species from the island of Sardinia to shed further light on the pathogens involved in the mass mortality. The results support the occurrence of a multifactorial disease and that Mycobacterium spp. and H. pinnae are not necessarily associated with the illness. Indeed, our analyses revealed that H. pinnae is not species-specific for P. nobilis, as it was present in other bivalves at least three years before the mass mortality began, and species of Mycobacterium were also found in healthy individuals of P. nobilis and P. rudis. We also detected the species Rhodococcus erythropolis, representing the first report in fan mussels of a bacterium other than Mycobacterium spp. and Vibrio spp. These results depict a complicated scenario, further demonstrating how the P. nobilis mass mortality event is far from being fully understood.

TI  - A systematic review of local to regional yield forecasting approaches and frequently used data resources
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Review
AB  - Forecasting crop yields, or providing an expectation of ex-ante harvest amounts, is highly relevant to the whole agricultural production chain. Farmers can adapt their management, traders or insurers their pricing schemes, suppliers their stocks, logistic companies their routes, national authorities their food balance sheets to guide import or export and, finally, international aid organizations can mobilize reliefs. Evidence has grown in the literature that such forecasts with a meaningful lead time are possible on various geographic scales and for a broad range of crops. Here, we present a systematic review of the methods applied in end-of-season yield forecasting and three frequently used data sources: weather data, satellite data and crop masks. Our literature database comprises 362 studies (2004-2019) which were evaluated regarding methods, crops, regions, data sources, lead time and performance. Moreover, we present 24 sources of real-time and predictive weather data, 21 sources of remote sensing data and 16 crop masks. Yield forecasting in our literature sample has been performed for 44 crops in 71 countries, also including many non-staple crops, but with an apparent bias in regions and crops. Forecasting performance depends on various factors, including crop, region, method, lead time to harvest and input diversity. Our systematic review supports a broader application of locally successful approaches at larger scales by providing a comprehensive, accessible compendium of necessary information for yield forecasting. We discuss improvement potentials with respect to methodological approaches and available data sources. We additionally suggest standardization procedures for future forecasting studies and encourage studying additional crops and geographic regions. Implications of forecasts for different target groups on different scales and the adaptation towards climate change are also discussed.

TI  - Creep Along the Central San Andreas Fault From Surface Fractures, Topographic Differencing, and InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging tectonic creep along active faults is critical for measuring strain accumulation and ultimately understanding the physical processes that guide creep and the potential for seismicity. We image tectonic deformation along the central creeping section of the San Andreas Fault at the Dry Lake Valley paleoseismic site (36.468 degrees N, 121.055 degrees W) using three data sets with varying spatial and temporal scales: (1) an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) velocity field with an similar to 100-km footprint produced from Sentinel-1 satellite imagery, (2) light detection and ranging (lidar) and structure-from-motion 3-D topographic differencing that resolves a decade of deformation over a 1-km aperture, and (3) surface fractures that formed over the 3- to 4-m wide fault zone during a drought from late 2012 to 2014. The InSAR velocity map shows that shallow deformation is localized to the San Andreas Fault. We demonstrate a novel approach for differencing airborne lidar and structure-from-motion topography that facilitates resolving deformation along and adjacent to the San Andreas Fault. The 40-m resolution topographic differencing resolves a 2.5 +/- 0.2 cm/yr slip rate localized to the fault. The opening-mode fractures accommodate 2.2(-0.6)(+0.8) cm/yr of fault slip. A 90% +/- 30% of the 1-km aperture deformation is accommodated over the several meter-wide surface trace of the San Andreas Fault. The extension direction inferred from the opening-mode fractures and topographic differencing is 40 degrees-48 degrees from the local trend of the San Andreas Fault. The localization of deformation likely reflects the well-oriented and mature fault.Plain Language Summary Typically, damaging earthquakes occur along faults as sudden movement following decades to millennia with very little to no fault motion. Creeping faults behave differently, slipping slowly and relatively continuously. While it may be easy to overlook the hazard they pose, moderate-magnitude earthquakes occur along creeping faults. Slip rates of several centimeters per year accumulate over time and can cause serious infrastructure damage to communities built along faults. We measure fault motion along the central portion of the creeping San Andreas Fault at a site located between Los Angeles and San Francisco. We constrain deformation at a variety of spatial scales including (1) movement over tens of kilometers from satellite radar imagery, (2) deformation within a 1-km aperture from light detection and ranging (lidar) and structure-from-motion topographic differencing, and (3) along the meter-scale width of the fault's trace from surface cracks. Integrating these data sets provides a new opportunity to image the 3-D fault zone structure, constrain fault slip rates, and analyze the strain budget. The data sets show that most if not all of the 2.5 cm/yr creep rate is localized to the 3- to 4-m wide fault at the Earth's surface. We attribute the high localization of deformation to the fault being mature and well-aligned for strike-slip movement.

TI  - Monitoring intra and inter annual dynamics of forest degradation from charcoal production in Southern Africa with Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of forest degradation to changes in forest carbon stocks remains poorly quantified and constitutes a main source of uncertainty in the forest carbon budget. Charcoal production is a major source of forest degradation in sub-Saharan Africa. We used multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery to monitor and quantify forest degradation extent in the main supplying area of a major urban center of southern Africa over a 4-year period. We implemented an indirect approach combining Sentinel-2 imagery to map kiln and field measurements to estimate AGB removals and carbon losses from charcoal production. This work generated 10m resolution maps of forest degradation extent from charcoal production in the study area at quarterly intervals from 2016-2019. These maps reveal an intense and rapid forest degradation process and expose the spatial and temporal patterns of forest degradation from charcoal production with high detail. The total area under charcoal production over the study period reached 26,647 ha (SD = 320.8) and the forest degradation front advanced 10.5 km in a 4-year period, with an average of 19.4 ha of woodlands degraded daily. By the end of 2019, charcoal production disturbed most mopane stands in the study area and woodland fragmentation increased in 70.4 % of the mopane woodlands. We estimated that charcoal production was responsible for 2,568,761 Mg (SD = 42,130) of aboveground biomass extracted from the forest and 1,284,381 Mg (SD = 21,075) of carbon loss. The magnitude of these figures underlines the relevance of charcoal production as a main cause of forest cover change and remarks the existing uncertainties in the quantification of forest degradation processes. These results illustrate the potential of multitemporal medium resolution imagery to quantify forest degradation in sub-Saharan Africa and improve REDD+ Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification systems in compliance with international reporting commitments.

AB  - This article examines advances in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) satellite measurement technologies to understand their relevance, utilization, and limitations for bridge monitoring. Waterloo Bridge is presented as a case study to explore how InSAR data sets can be combined with traditional measurement techniques including sensors installed on the bridge and automated total stations. A novel approach to InSAR bridge monitoring was adopted by the installation of physical reflectors at key points of structural interest on the bridge, in order to supplement the bridges own reflection characteristics and ensure that the InSAR measurements could be directly compared and combined with <italic>in situ</italic> measurements. The interpretation and integration of InSAR data sets with civil infrastructure data are more than a trivial task, and a discussion of uncertainty of measurement data is presented. Finally, a strategy for combining and interpreting varied data from multiple sources to provide useful insights into each of these methods is presented, outlining the practical applications of this data analysis to support wider monitoring strategies.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article invoves in the preprocessing of hyperion data, and denoising of hyperspectral reference spectral library, which is generated from the spectro-radiometer. The atmospheric correction module like Fast Line-of-sight of Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes provided the smooth absolute spectral profile. In connection to that, the Hybrid Adaptive Bilateral Filter (HABF) is proposed for denoising of field based spectral library, and laboratory based spectral library. To implement the proposed algorithm, spectral library of mangrove has been exploited, which is collected from Muthupet mangrove forest, and spectra of particular species is generated from Field-spectro-radiometer with wavelength ranges from 350 nm to 2500 nm, and 10 nm band width. This spectral library has been used as an input signal since it contains noise across wavelength ranges from 350 - 450 nm, 1000 - 1200 nm, and 2000 - 2500 nm due to atmospheric conditions. These noises can be removed effectively by the proposed wavelet based HABF techniques and conventional method of denoising. The performance of each method was compared with performance evaluation parameter such as PSNR and MSE

TI  - Ice-free period detection method in the Arctic coastal zone
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An advanced methodology for the detection and quantification of the ice-free period in the Arctic coastal zone is proposed. Ice-free period (IFP) dynamics is analyzed in the Kara Sea coastal zone near "Marresalya" and "Amderma" stations using long-term satellite data about sea ice concentrations. In a new method an advanced approach for defining the IFP characteristics (starting/ending dates and duration) was applied in addition to the conventional use of 15% sea ice concentration threshold. We provide estimates of the mean statistics and linear trends in the IFP characteristics using three long-term satellite-based sea ice concentration datasets: OSI SAF, NSIDC, JAXA and compare them to the estimates based upon direct observations on stations. Mean IFP durations and ending dates as well as linear trends derived from satellite data show a close comparability with observations with differences ranging within 2-7 days for IFP durations and within 0.01-0.05 days/year for IFP ending date trends. At the same time, strong deviations were found for both mean and long-term trends of the IFP starting dates, specifically showing negative trends in the satellite-derived starting dates which is not confirmed by observations. This results in a moderate agreement on trend estimates in IFP durations between satellite data and observations, while the mean characteristics are in a very good agreement and implies the necessity of more careful look onto representativeness of satellite data in the near-coastal zone during the onset season.

TI  - Long-term AOD trend assessment over the Eastern Mediterranean region: A comparative study including a new merged aerosol product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study conducts a comprehensive estimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) trend and a classification of types of aerosols over the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD and Angstrom exponent (AE) during 1980-2018 and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1/Terra and Aqua products during 2001-2018 and 2003-2018, respectively. Seven countries and sixteen cities were selected for the analysis. Evaluation of MODIS and MERRA-2 AOD with nine stations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD indicated spatial agreement. A new merged AOD product of MERRA-2 and MODIS (MMM) was generated. The performance of MMM not only indicated a better agreement than MODIS and MERRA-2, but also showed an efficient estimation compared to AERONET. Overall, MERRA-2 was able to quantitatively reproduce seasonal and annual AOD trends on regional scale compared to MODIS and MMM though slight differences were present in some areas. High AOD loading was mainly detected in the areas of natural mineral dust during spring and summer. Regional aerosol loading was relatively low in winter and autumn. Our results indicated that the AOD had an upward trend in the EM region during 1998-2018. Furthermore, AOD trend shifted from upward to downward around 2006 over all the countries. Our analysis revealed a dominance of clean maritime (42.95%) over the eastern part and the mixed type aerosols (34.93 and 49.13%) over the northern and southern parts. This suggests that the EM region is influenced by a variety of aerosols.

TI  - Ground Deformation and Its Causes in Abbottabad City, Pakistan from Sentinel-1A Data and MT-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence, as one of the engineering geological problems in the world, is generally caused by compression of unconsolidated strata due to natural or anthropogenic activities. We employed interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) as a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique on ascending and descending Sentinel-1A the terrain observation with progressive scans SAR (TOPSAR) images acquired between January 2015 and December 2018 to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution and cause of subsidence in Abbottabad City of Pakistan. The line of sight (LOS) average deformation velocities along ascending and descending orbits were decomposed into vertical velocity fields and compared with geological data, ground water pumping schemes, and precipitation data. The decomposed and averaged vertical velocity results showed significant subsidence in most of the urban areas in the city. The most severe subsidence was observed close to old Karakorum highway, where the subsidence rate varied up to -6.5 cm/year. The subsidence bowl profiles along W-E and S-N transects showed a relationship with the locations of some water pumping stations. The monitored LOS time series histories along an ascending orbit showed a close correlation with the rainfall during the investigation period. Comparative analysis of this uneven prominent subsidence with geological and precipitation data reflected that the subsidence in the Abbottabad city was mainly related to anthropogenic activities, overexploitation of water, and consolidation of soil layer. The study represents the first ever evidence of land subsidence and its causes in the region that will support the local government as well as decision and policy makers for better planning to overcome problems of overflowing drains, sewage system, littered roads/streets, and sinking land in the city.

TI  - Flood Inundation Mapping of the Hitachi Region in the Kuji River Basin, Japan, During the October 11-13, 2019 Extreme Rain Event
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of severe flood events has been increasing recently in Japan. One of the latest events occurred in October 2019 and caused extensive damage in several river basins, especially in the central and northern regions of the country. In this study, we selected the Hitachi region (Hitachi-Omiya and Hitachi-Ota) within the Kuji River Basin which underwent considerable flooding due to the failure of embankments at two locations in the region. Maximum-possible flood inundation maps were generated using survey-based data and hydrological modeling for the Hitachi region. These maps incorporated the flood scenarios (embankment failures). All the generated products were compared with the reference flood mapping, i.e., Sentinel-1 data and Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) data for that region. It was observed that generated flood inundation mapping product based on the survey-data yielded results similar to those obtained with GSI data for the Hitachi region. Although each flood mapping product has advantages and disadvantages, they can be a good reference for the proper management and mitigation of flood disaster in the future. The rapid development of flood inundation mapping products that consider varying flood scenarios is an important part of flood mitigation strategies.

TI  - Relationship between Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines and Clinical Characteristics in Han People with Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in Dalian, China
T2  - IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Most patients with untreated chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection develop hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic disease progression is monitored with hematological markers (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], albumin and platelet [PLT] count, AST/ALT ratio, AST/PLT ratio index [APRI], and fibrosis 4 score [FIB-4]) and FibroScan (manufactured in Echosens, France).Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the association between Duffy antigen/chemokines receptor (DARC) polymorphisms and clinical parameters in the Han people with chronic hepatitis C infection in Dalian, China.Methods: This cohort study was performed on 245 Han people with chronic HCV at Dalian infectious hospital during April-December 2015. The participants of the research were selected using the consecutive sampling method. The DARC genotyping was performed using the TaqMan probe method and transient elastography was measured by FibroScan.Results: Based on the findings, DARC polymorphisms correlated with ALT concentrations (FY*A/FY*A vs. FY*A/FY*B, P=0.025). However, the DARC polymorphism did not have an association with HCV RNA titers (FY*A/FY*A vs. FY*A/FY*B, P=0.241) or hepatic fibrosis (FY*A/FY* A vs. FY*A/FY*B, P=0.325). Moreover, correlation analyses showed that APRI (P<0.001, rho=0.603) and FIB-4 (P<0.001, rho=0.698) were useful predictors of hepatic fibrosis in chronic HCV infection. Besides, HCV RNA titers (P=0.327) and hepatic injury markers (P=0.814, 0.198, 0.767, and 0.171 for ALT, AST, ALB, and AST/ALT, respectively) were not useful for the estimation of the fibrosis stage in patients with chronic hepatitis C.Conclusion: The FY*A allele is a potentially valuable protective factor against hepatocyte damage in chronic HCV-infected patients.

TI  - Cyclone Wind Retrieval Based on X-Band SAR-Derived Wave Parameter Estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a method for retrieving wind speed from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected under extreme weather conditions is proposed. The rationale for this approach relies on the fact that, although copolarized channels exhibit saturation for wind speed > similar to 20 m s(-1), the wave growth can be successfully exploited to gather information on wind speed under extreme weather conditions. Hence, in this study, the intrinsic relationship among the wind-wave triplets [wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface, significant wave height (SWH), and peak wave period] is exploited in order to retrieve wind speeds under tropical cyclone conditions. Experiments, undertaken on actual X-band TerraSAR-X (TS-X) SAR images of tropical cyclones (Typhoon Megi, Hurricane Sandy, and Hurricane Miriam) and using collocated WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) simulations, revealed the robustness of the proposed approach, which resulted in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.54 m s(-1) when comparing the retrieved wind speeds with the values from products delivered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division (HRD). However, the applicability of the algorithm herein will be further confirmed at very strong storms.

TI  - Three Religious-Cultural Worldviews in <i>Noah</i> (2014)-Hedonism, Fundamentalism, and Ecofeminism
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND POPULAR CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes an interpretative study of Darren Aronofsky's film Noah. The film draws inspiration from various spiritual traditions ranging from shamanism to Buddhism, whilst relying heavily on Jewish midrash, and adds a layer of innovation. Our main assertion is that the film attempts to present three viewpoints on issues of religion, humanity, nature, and God-while negating two of them and preferring one. Each of the various characters and groups in the film represents one of the three stances, as the film's protagonist must cope with the problematic nature of his worldview and revisit it. The film engages with current pivotal issues: climate change, the depletion of natural resources, materialism and hedonism, fundamentalism in both religious and environmental trends, suspicion of religious institutionalized interpretations, and gendered spiritual religious beliefs. Thus, the film Noah is a cultural product that disseminates spiritual ideas and values within mainstream culture.

TI  - Capturing the Impact of the 2018 European Drought and Heat across Different Vegetation Types Using OCO-2 Solar-Induced Fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European heatwave of 2018 led to record-breaking temperatures and extremely dry conditions in many parts of the continent, resulting in widespread decrease in agricultural yield, early tree-leaf senescence, and increase in forest fires in Northern Europe. Our study aims to capture the impact of the 2018 European heatwave on the terrestrial ecosystem through the lens of a high-resolution solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) data acquired from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. SIF is proposed to be a direct proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP) and thus can be used to draw inferences about changes in photosynthetic activity in vegetation due to extreme events. We explore spatial and temporal SIF variation and anomaly in the spring and summer months across different vegetation types (agriculture, broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, and mixed forest) during the European heatwave of 2018 and compare it to non-drought conditions (most of Southern Europe). About one-third of Europe's land area experienced a consecutive spring and summer drought in 2018. Comparing 2018 to mean conditions (i.e., those in 2015-2017), we found a change in the intra-spring season SIF dynamics for all vegetation types, with lower SIF during the start of spring, followed by an increase in fluorescence from mid-April. Summer, however, showed a significant decrease in SIF. Our results show that particularly agricultural areas were severely affected by the hotter drought of 2018. Furthermore, the intense heat wave in Central Europe showed about a 31% decrease in SIF values during July and August as compared to the mean over the previous three years. Furthermore, our MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and OCO-2 comparative results indicate that especially for coniferous and mixed forests, OCO-2 SIF has a quicker response and a possible higher sensitivity to drought in comparison to MODIS's fPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) when considering shorter reference periods, which highlights the added value of remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence for studying the impact of drought on vegetation.

TI  - Understanding the long-term trend of particulate phosphorus in a cyanobacteria-dominated lake using MODIS-Aqua observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the long-term trends in phosphorus (P) in lake waters is critical for clarifying transformation and biogeochemical cycling processes of P. We developed and validated an empirical model for deriving particulate phosphorus (PP, a dominant form of P) from MODIS-Aqua (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. Subsequently, the long-term trend in PP in Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2017 and the driving factors were clarified. Based on the spectral index of the combination of remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm and 859 nm, a simple linear model was developed to derive PP for turbid cyanobacteria-dominated inland waters from MODIS-Aqua data (R-2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.048 mg/L). Long-term MODIS observations show that PP demonstrated distinct spatial variations in Lake Taihu, with higher PP levels in cyanobacterial bloom-sensitive regions. There was a clear increasing trend in the PP of Lake Taihu, and the yearly average PP value increased from 0.089 mg/L in 2003 to 0.10 mg/L in 2017. A relatively strong positive correlation between 15-year spatially averaged PP data and algal bloom frequency revealed that cyanobacterial blooms mainly controlled the PP spatial variations. The daily average water temperature was significantly correlated with the daily PP derived from MODIS-Aqua data, indicating that the increasing water temperature was responsible for the PP increasing trend. An increase in water temperature can facilitate algal growth, thus resulting in a significant change in aquatic biogeochemical conditions, inducing more P release from the sediment and thereby increasing water PP levels. Our study has significant implications for understanding and controlling the P biogeochemical cycle in a cyanobacterial-dominated lake under the background of global warming. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Geostatistical and Remote Sensing Studies to Identify High Metallogenic Potential Regions in the Kivi Area of Iran
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kivi area in the East Azerbaijan Province of Iran is one of the country's highest-potential regions for metal element exploration. The primary goal herein was to process the data obtained from geochemical, geostatistical, and remote sensing tools (in the form of stream sediment samples and satellite images) to identify metallic mineralization anomalies in the region. After correcting the raw stream sediment geochemical data, single-variable statistical processing was performed, and Ti and Zn were identified as the elements with the highest degree of contrast. The relationship among these elements was further investigated using correlation and hierarchical clustering analyses. Principal component analysis was then applied to determine the principal components related to these elements, which were subsequently plotted on a regional geological map. Elements related to Ti and Zn were identified using threshold limits of anomalous samples determined via linear discriminant analysis. Lithological units and alteration patterns were detected through remote sensing investigations on Landsat-8 images. Stream sediment geochemical and remote sensing survey results identified anomalous areas of Ti and Zn in the eastern part of the study region. Our results indicate that Ti and Zn are good pathfinder elements for further exploratory investigation in this area.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the formation of heat island in megacities have become an emerging environmental concern. The main objective of this study is to predict the intensity of Tehran's heat island in the year 2033 based on historical changes of land cover and LST. For this purpose, Landsat satellite images were integrated with meteorological stations' measurements from 1985 to 2017. The Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used to predict the land cover changes and to the modelling of the Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII), Surface Urban Heat Island Ratio Index (SUHRI) was used. Subsequently, using statistical analysis of the effect of historical land cover changes on LST variations, SUHII for 2033 was predicted. Our findings show that within this period, the built-up lands increased significantly from 39% in 1985 to 65% in 2017. The intensity of heat island increased with an increase in the value of SUHII from 0.02 to 0.19. Our predictive analysis reveals that the intensity of the Tehran's heat island will increase to 0.32 by 2033. Our conclusions draw attentions to the increasing LST now and in the future in Tehran so that urban planners and local authorities take adequate actions for controlling its environmental impacts.

TI  - Investigating the Retention of Solar Wind Implanted Helium-3 on the Moon from the Analysis of Multi-Wavelength Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moon has a large potential for space exploration and mining valuable resources. In particular, He-3 provides rich sources of non-radioactive fusion fuel to fulfill cislunar and Earth's energy demands, if found economically feasible. The present study focuses on developing advanced techniques to prospect He-3 resources on the Moon from multi-sensor remote sensing perspectives. It characterizes optical changes in regolith materials due to space weathering as a new retention parameter and introduces a novel machine learning inversion model for retrieving the physical properties of the regolith. Our analysis suggests that the reddening of the soil predominantly governs the retention, along with attenuated mafic band depths. Moreover, semi-variograms show that the spatial variability of He-3 is aligned with the episodic weathering events at different timescales. We also observed that pyroclastic regoliths with high dielectric constant and increased surface scattering mechanisms exhibited a He-3 abundant region. For ejecta cover, the retention was weakly associated with the dielectric contrast and a circular polarization ratio (CPR), mainly because of the He-3-deficient nature of the regolith. Furthermore, cross-variograms revealed inherent cyclicity attributed to the sequential process of weathering effects. Our study provides new insights into the physical nature and near-surface alterations of lunar regoliths that influence the spatial distribution and retention of solar wind implanted He-3.

T2  - International Journal of Aquatic Biology-IJAB
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was carried out to determine the distribution of Najas marina, an invasive floral species in the Ramsar site of Madu Ganga Estuary in Sri Lanka using ASTER satellite data. Cloud free ASTER imageries of Madu Ganga Estuary with 15 m resolution were atmospherically corrected using the FLAASH in ENVI software. The NDVI was calculated and unsupervised classification was applied for the study site for each image and the distribution maps of N. marina were developed from 2007 to 2014. Methodology was validated using in situ data, which were collected in 2014 with monthly intervals parallel to ASTER overpass. The derived distribution maps indicated that N. marina was distributed in about 31% of the estuary in April 2014. The highest densities were mostly found in bay areas and peripheral areas. Maps developed for December 2007, December 2009 and December 2013 indicated that there is a temporal variation in the distribution of N. marina over the years. The overall distribution of N. marina has decreased from December 2007 to December 2009 and increased from December 2009 to April 2014. Low water levels and stagnation of water appears to be conducive for the variation of this species. These factors should be taken into consideration when managing the invasion of N. marina in this economically and ecologically important estuary.

TI  - Wildfire Severity Mapping Using Sentinel Satellite Data Based on Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In South Korea with forest as a major land cover class (over 60% of the country), many wildfires occur every year. Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data. Three wildfire cases-Samcheok in May 2017, Gangreung . Donghae in April 2019, and Gosung . Sokcho in April 2019-were used for developing wildfire severity mapping models with three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine). The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future.

TI  - Study of ARIMA and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in the most affected countries
T2  - CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Discussions about the recently identified deadly coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 are common around the globe now. This is an infectious and even life-threatening disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has rapidly spread to other countries from its originating place infecting millions of people globally. To understand future phenomena, strong mathematical models are required with the least prediction errors. In the present study, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models are applied to the data consisting of daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the most affected five countries of the world for modeling and predicting one-month confirmed cases of this disease. To validate these models, the prediction results were tested by comparing it with testing data. The results revealed better accuracy of the LS-SVM model over the ARIMA model and also suggested a rapid rise of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in all the countries under study. This analysis would help governments to take necessary actions in advance associated with the preparation of isolation wards, availability of medicines and medical staff, a decision on lockdown, training of volunteers, and economic plans.

TI  - Applications of Remote Sensing in Precision Agriculture: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015-2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.

TI  - Can Low-cost Indo Cyanine Green Florescence Technique for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Replace Dual Dye (Radio-colloid and Blue Dye) Technique in Early Breast Cancer: A Prospective Two-arm Comparative Study
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This non-randomized, prospective, observational study was conducted to assess the detection and accuracy of sentinel lymph node detection with indocyanine green in comparison with the gold standard dual-dye technique. The study confirms high sensitivity for fluorescence localization with comparable performance with the gold standard. Indocyanine green can be employed as a sole tracer avoiding potential drawbacks of standard tracer agents.Background: The objective of this study was to assess the detection and accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) using the low-cost indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence method and to compare this method with the gold standard dual-dye method (radio-colloid methylene blue dye [MR. Materials and Methods: One hundred patients with node-negative early breast cancer assessed clinically and by ultrasound axilla underwent an SLNB procedure using technetium-99m radio-colloid, MB, and ICG. The detection rate of SLNs and positive SLNs and the number of SLNs were compared. The injection safety of ICG and MB was evaluated. Results: One hundred female patients with a median age of 52.3 years participated in the study. Sixty-eight percent had a body mass index < 25, 85% presented with a palpable lump, of which 59% were in the outer quadrant. SLNs were identified in all 100 cases. A total of 290 SLNs were removed (mean, 2.9; range, 1-6). The identification rate with dual dye was 94%, whereas with ICG alone, it was 96%. The SLNB sensitivity rate and false negative rate were 97.6% versus 93.2% and 3.1 % versus 6.2% in the ICG and dual-dye combination, respectively. None of the patients had any local or systemic reaction with ICG; 3 patients with blue dye had tattooing and staining of skin. Conclusion: ICG fluorescence imaging permits real time visualization of lymphatics and provides an additional dimension to SLN biopsy that is safe and effective. These results confirm high sensitivity for fluorescence localization with comparable performance to the gold standard. ICG can reliably replace dual dye and be employed as a sole tracer for SLNB in early breast cancer. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mesoscale Ocean Feature Identification in the North Aegean Sea with the Use of Sentinel-3 Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of oceanographic circulation related features is a valuable tool for environmental and fishery management authorities, commercial use and institutional research. Remote sensing techniques are suitable for detection, as in situ measurements are prohibitively costly, spatially sparse and infrequent. Still, these imagery applications require a certain level of technical and theoretical skill making them practically unreachable to the immediate beneficiaries. In this paper a new geospatial web service is proposed for providing daily data on mesoscale oceanic feature identification in the North Aegean Sea, produced by Sentinel-3 SLSTR Sea Surface Temperature (SST) imagery, to end users. The service encompasses an automated process for: raw data acquisition, interpolation, oceanic feature extraction and publishing through a webGIS application. Level-2 SST data are interpolated through a Co-Kriging algorithm, involving information from short term historical data, in order to retain as much information as possible. A modified gradient edge detection methodology is then applied to the interpolated products for the mesoscale feature extraction. The resulting datasets are served according to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards and are available for visualization, processing and download though a dedicated web portal.

M3  - Article
AB  - The global challenge of living together peacefully and constructively in the context of deep religious/worldview differences will not be met through bumper-sticker slogans about "tolerance." This essay provides an introductory overview of a richer approach called covenantal pluralism, which has been developed over the last few years at the Templeton Religion Trust. The philosophy of covenantal pluralism is a robust, relational, and non-relativistic paradigm of citizenship that emphasizes both legal equality and neighborly solidarity. It calls not only for a constitutional order characterized by equal rights and responsibilities but also a culture of engagement characterized by relationships of mutual respect and protection.

TI  - Comparison of Cloud-Filling Algorithms for Marine Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine remote sensing provides comprehensive characterizations of the ocean surface across space and time. However, cloud cover is a significant challenge in marine satellite monitoring. Researchers have proposed various algorithms to fill data gaps "below the clouds", but a comparison of algorithm performance across several geographic regions has not yet been conducted. We compared ten basic algorithms, including data-interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF), geostatistical interpolation, and supervised learning methods, in two gap-filling tasks: the reconstruction of chlorophyll a in pixels covered by clouds, and the correction of regional mean chlorophyll a concentrations. For this purpose, we combined tens of cloud-free images with hundreds of cloud masks in four study areas, creating thousands of situations in which to test the algorithms. The best algorithm depended on the study area and task, and differences between the best algorithms were small. Ordinary Kriging, spatiotemporal Kriging, and DINEOF worked well across study areas and tasks. Random forests reconstructed individual pixels most accurately. We also found that high levels of cloud cover led to considerable errors in estimated regional mean chlorophyll a concentration. These errors could, however, be reduced by about 50% to 80% (depending on the study area) with prior cloud-filling.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th Annual Meeting of the Academic-Surgical-Congress (ASC)
CL  - Assoc Acad Surg, Orlando, FL
AB  - Background: The present literature is conflicting regarding the management of micro invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (miDCIS) as to following recommendations for DCIS (margin status, surgical axillary staging, and possible observation) versus invasive breast cancer. We hypothesize that miDCIS represents more aggressive disease than pure DCIS.Methods: We performed a retrospective review of female miDCIS patients compared with age-matched cohorts of DCIS and T1b/c patients with invasive breast cancer. We collected demographic, clinicopathologic, treatment, and outcome information. Analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results: We included 375 patients (125 in each group) with median age 59 y (range 33-91 y). miDCIS tumors were more likely to be hormone receptor negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive compared with DCIS or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC; all P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by miDCIS focality demonstrated no significant differences. The number of involved lymph nodes was not significantly different from DCIS patients but was significantly fewer than invasive cancer patients. Of 115 miDCIS patients (88%) staged with sentinel lymph node biopsy, eight (7%) had nodal metastases. Six miDCIS patients (5%) were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Over a median follow-up of 23.3 mo, there were no significant differences in local or distant recurrence.Conclusions: Based on our results, miDCIS has more aggressive pathologic features compared with DCIS and warrants surgical treatment and nodal staging similar to the management of IDC. In addition, similar to IDC, nodal and receptor status may influence medical management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The use of Atlantic hagfish (<i>Myxine glutinosa</i>) as a bioindicator species for studies on effects of dumped chemical warfare agents in the Skagerrak. 1: Liver histopathology
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of the international project DAIMON (Decision Aid for Marine Munitions), the impact of dumped chemical munitions on fish health was investigated. The Skagerrak Straight (North Sea, at 600 m depth) contains munitions with chemical warfare agents (CWA), scuttled after the end of World War II. Studies of liver histopathology in Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) were carried out at three sampling sites: at a wreck with CWA in the Skagerrak (n = 82), a Skagerrak reference site considered to be free of CWA (n = 14) and at a reference site in the northern North Sea outside the Skagerrak (n = 17). Liver lesions were diagnosed and categorized according to standardized ICES and BEQUALM protocols and OSPAR guidelines.Non-specific liver lesions were found in 87.6% of 113 hagfish examined. The prevalence of pre-neoplastic lesions was 7.1% and of neoplastic lesions 6.2%. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence between hagfish samples from the wreck site and from the reference site near the wrecks. However, at the reference site in the northern North Sea, the prevalence of non-specific lesions was low and neither pre-neoplastic nor neoplastic lesions were observed.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of indicator species has become a standard monitoring approach in environmental risk assessment; however, pollutant bioavailability and its geographical distribution as well as species-sensitiveness could be affected by different factors. The present study investigated the potential use of the land snail Cornu aspersum as bioindicator of industrial air pollution by using cytological and biochemical responses and trace element levels in individuals caged in proximity to an industrial setting. Eleven sites were selected based on wind direction and distance. Snails were placed in holed plastic cages, transplanted to each site and maintained for 30 days fed at libitum and under constant humidity. Several oxidative stress responses including catalase (CAT) and glu-tathione-s-transferase (GST) activities, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total metallothioneins (MTs) content were determined in snail hepatopancreas while lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and loss of DNA integrity through micronuclei frequency (MN) were assessed in haemocytes. Trace elements were also analysed in snail whole soft tissues. Multi-model inference used to predict snail's biological responses in relation to trace elements levels and distance from the industrial setting was able to disentangle the relative contributions of different influencing predictors and could be successfully applied in environmental risk assessment by using land snail as bioindicator species.

TI  - Object-based crop classification in Hetao plain using random forest
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification based on object-based image analysis (OBIA) is increasingly reported. However, it is still challenging to produce high-quality crop type maps by using recent techniques. This article introduces a new object-based crop classification algorithm which contains 4 steps. First, a random forest (RF) classifier is trained by using the initial training set, which tends to have a relatively small size. Second, importance scores for each feature variable are derived by using the RF model. Third, by treating the importance scores as weighting factors, a weighted Euclidean distance criterion is designed and used for sample creation to enlarge training set. Fourth, RF is re-trained by using the enlarged training set, and then it is employed for final classification. To validate the proposed strategy, a Worldview-2 image covering a part of Hetao plain is experimented. Results indicate that the new method yields the best overall accuracy, which equals 90.52%.

TI  - Machine learning-assisted region merging for remote sensing image segmentation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing popularity of OBIA, many scholars advocate that image segmentation plays a significant role in remote sensing image processing. Numerous segmentation algorithms for remote sensing images are based on region merging. Although good improvement is achieved, their accuracy is still dependent on parameter settings, leading to a low level of automation. To overcome this issue, this work proposes a new region merging method by using a random forest (RF) classifier. Unlike the traditional region merging methods that all adopt a scale threshold to determine whether a merging can be conducted, the new algorithm relies on a trained RF to decide the result of a merging test. Various merging criteria are simultaneously employed as feature variables of the RF model, enhancing the quality of the proposed scheme. The major problem in this work is how to train the RF classifier since the merging test samples need to be obtained in the iterative steps of a region merging process, which involves a huge number of human-computer interactions even for a small image. To simplify it, a sample collection strategy based on a set of three-scale segmentation results is devised. Representative merging test samples can be obtained by using this method. To validate the proposed technique, four Gaofen-2 images are used for training sample collection, and the most interesting result is that the samples extracted from one image can apply to others. Some images captured by Orbview-3, GeoEye-1, and Worldview-2 further indicate the robust performance of the new algorithm and the samples acquired in this work.

TI  - Capturing respiratory syncytial virus season in Belgium using the influenza severe acute respiratory infection surveillance network, season 2018/19
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children (<5 years old) and older adults (>= 65 years old) leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend the implementation of a dedicated surveillance in countries. Aim: We tested the capacity of the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) hospital network to contribute to RSV surveillance in Belgium. Methods: During the 2018/19 influenza season, we started the SARI surveillance for influenza in Belgium in week40, earlier than in the past, to follow RSV activity, which usually precedes influenza virus circulation. While the WHO SARI case definition for influenza normally used by the SARI hospital network was employed, flexibility over the fever criterion was allowed, so patients without fever but meeting the other case definition criteria could be included in the surveillance. Results: Between weeks 40 2018 and 2 2019, we received 508 samples from SARI patients. We found an overall RSV detection rate of 62.4% (317/508), with rates varying depending on the age group: 77.6% in children aged <5 years (253/326) and 34.4% in adults aged >= 65Years (44/128). Over 90% of the RSV-positive samples also positive for another tested respiratory virus (80/85) were from children aged <5years. Differences were also noted between age groups for symptoms, cornorbidities and complications. Conclusion: With only marginal modifications in the case definition and the period of surveillance, the Belgian SARI network would be able to substantially contribute to RSV surveillance and burden evaluation in children and older adults, the two groups of particular interest for WHO.

TI  - Assessment of satellite-derived rainfall and its use in the ACRU agro-hydrological model
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - Unfortunately, for various reasons, in-situ rain gauge networks are diminishing, especially in southern Africa, resulting in sparse networks whose records give a poor representation of rainfall occurrence, patterns and magnitudes. Hydrological models are used to inform decision making; however, model performance is directly linked to the quality of input data, such as rainfall. Therefore, the use of satellite-derived rainfall is being increasingly advocated as a viable alternative or supplement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the representativeness of satellite-derived rainfall and its utility in the ACRU agro-hydrologkal model to simulate streamflow magnitudes, distributions and patterns. The satellite-derived rainfall products selected for use in this study were TRMM3B42, FEWSARC2.0, FEWSRFE2.0, TAMSAT 3.0 and GPM-IMERG4. The satellite rainfall products were validated against available historical observed records and then were used to drive simulations using the ACRU agro-hydrological model in the upper uMngeni, upper uThukela and upper and central Breede catchments in South Africa. At the daily timescale, satellite-derived and observed rainfall were poorly correlated and variable among locations. However, monthly, seasonal and yearly rainfall totals and simulated streamflow volumes were in closer agreement with historical observations than the daily correlations; more so in the upper uMngeni and uThukela than in the upper and central Breede (e.g. FEWSARC2.0 and FEWSRFE2.0, producing relative volume errors of 318%, 4.63%, -5.07% and 2.54%, 9.54%, -1.67%, respectively, at Gauges V2E002, 0268883 and 02396985). Therefore, the satellite-derived rainfall shows promise for use in applications operating at coarser temporal scales than at finer daily ones. Complex topographical rainfall generation and varying weather systems, e.g. frontal rainfall, affected the accuracy of satellite-derived product estimates. This study focused on utilising the wealth of available raw satellite data; however, it is clear that the raw satellite data need to be corrected for bias and/or downscaled to provide more accurate results.

TI  - Evaluation of Vegetation Index-Based Curve Fitting Models for Accurate Classification of Salt Marsh Vegetation Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful launch of the Sentinel-2 constellation satellite, along with advanced cloud detection algorithms, has enabled the generation of continuous time series at high spatial and temporal resolutions, which is in turn expected to enable the classification of salt marsh vegetation over larger spatiotemporal scales. This study presents a critical comparison of vegetation index (VI) and curve fitting methods-two key factors for time series construction that potentially influence vegetation classification performance. To accomplish this objective, the stability of five different VI time series, namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and Water-Adjusted Vegetation Index (WAVI), was compared empirically; the suitability between three curve fitting methods, namely Asymmetric Gaussian (AG), Double Logistic (DL), and Two-term Fourier (TF), and VI time series was measured using the coefficient of determination, and the salt marsh vegetation separability among different combinations of VI time series and curve fitting methods (i.e., VI time series-based curve fitting model) was quantified using overall the Jeffries-Matusita distance. Six common types of salt marsh vegetation from three typical coastal sites in China were used to validate these findings, which demonstrate: (1) the SAVI performed best in terms of time series stability, while the EVI exhibited relatively poor time series stability with conspicuous outliers induced by the sensitivity to omitted clouds and shadows; (2) the DL method commonly resulted in the most accurate classification of different salt marsh vegetation types, especially when combined with the EVI time series, followed by the TF method; and (3) the SAVI/NDVI-based DL/TF model demonstrated comparable efficiency for classifying salt marsh vegetation. Notably, the SAVI/NDVI-based DL model performed most strongly for high latitude regions with a continental climate, whilst the SAVI/NDVI-based TF model appears to be better suited to mid- to low latitude regions dominated by a monsoonal climate.

TI  - Dynamics of desert.oasis ecotone and its influencing factors in Tarim Basin
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The desert.oasis ecotone is the connection zone between desert and oasis ecosystems. It is mainly composed of natural vegetation and is a natural barrier to maintain ecological security of the oasis in the arid area. With Landsat remote sensing images, land use and meteorological data, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of the interdecadal dynamic change of desert. oasis ecotone in the Tarim River Basin from 1990 to 2015. Over the 25 years, the area of the des. ert.oasis ecotone continuously decreased, with an annual change rate of 1.24%. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values decreased over time, from 0.142 in 1990 to 0.127 in 2015. The area corresponding to arable land in the Tarim Basin increased from 2.45x10(4) km(2) to 4.01x10(4) km(2) in 2015. The continuously expanding area of arable land strongly occupied the eco. logical space in the desert.oasis ecotone. With continuous expansion of arable land area, ground. water levels had fallen sharply due to over exploitation. With the increasing drought stress, some species with shallow root died, resulting in reduced vegetation coverage and reduced ecological barrier functions. The desert.oasis ecotone has a natural barrier function to maintain the stability of oasis. based agricultural production and protect ecological security of the oasis. In.depth study of the spatiotemporal changes and related driving forces in this special zone would help propose ecological protection solutions and measures, provide scientific and technological support for the implementation of major strategies and the construction of ecological civilization in the Western China.

TI  - Changing Patterns of Lakes on The Southern Tibetan Plateau Based on Multi-Source Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 1100 lakes covering an area greater than 4500 km(2) are located on the Tibetan Plateau, and these lakes are important regulators of several large and famous rivers in Asia. The determination of hydrological changes that have occurred in these lakes can reflect climate change and supply scientific data to plateau environmental research. Data from high frequency (moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer) MODIS images, altimetry, and the Hydroweb database collected during 2000-2015 were integrated in this study to delineate the detailed hydrological changes of 15 lakes in three basins-Inner Basin, Indus Basin, and Brahmaputra Basin-on the southern Tibetan Plateau. Seven of the 10 lakes in the Inner Basin presented increasing trends with various intensities, and the increasing rates in the area of four lakes (Nam Co, Selin Co, Zhari-namco, and Ngangze) were 1.62, 28.81, 2.27, and 3.70 km(2)/yr, respectively. The yearly increases in volume of the four lakes were 3.6, 9.44, 6, and 2.36 km(3), respectively. A water balance equation was established for the four lakes based on lake volume changes to illustrate the contributions of precipitation, ground runoff, evaporation, and other factors. The results revealed that surface runoff was the major contributor to expansion, and lake surface evaporation was almost 2.76-3.86 times that of lake surface precipitation. The two lakes in Indus Basin, Rakshastal and Mapam Yumco, presented a slight retreat. As a representative of Brahmaputra Basin, Yamzho Yumco underwent a retreat of -3.49 km(2)/yr in area, -0.39 m/yr in level, and -0.19 km(3)/yr in volume. Decreasing precipitation, increasing evaporation, and the operation of a hydrological project were the main causes of its constant retreat.

TI  - Addressing the need for improved land cover map products for policy support
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The continued increase of anthropogenic pressure on the Earth's ecosystems is degrading the natural environ-ment and then decreasing the services it provides to humans. The type, quantity, and quality of many of those services are directly connected to land cover, yet competing demands for land continue to drive rapid land cover change, affecting ecosystem services. Accurate and updated land cover information is thus more important than ever, however, despite its importance, the needs of many users remain only partially attended. A key underlying reason for this is that user needs vary widely, since most current products - and there are many available - are produced for a specific type of end user, for example the climate modelling community. With this in mind we focus on the need for flexible, automated processing approaches that support on-demand, customized land cover products at various scales. Although land cover processing systems are gradually evolving in this direction there is much more to do and several important challenges must be addressed, including high quality reference data for training and validation and even better access to satellite data. Here, we 1) present a generic system ar-chitecture that we suggest land cover production systems evolve towards, 2) discuss the challenges involved, and 3) propose a step forward. Flexible systems that can generate on-demand products that match users' specific needs would fundamentally change the relationship between users and land cover products - requiring more government support to make these systems a reality.

TI  - Agricultural Drought Monitoring by MODIS Potential Evapotranspiration Remote Sensing Data Application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current Polish Agricultural Drought Monitoring System (ADMS) adopted Climatic Water Balance (CWB) as the main indicator of crop losses caused by drought conditions. All meteorological data needed for CWB assessment are provided by the ground meteorological stations network. In 2018, the network consisted of 665 stations, among which in only 58 stations full weather parameters were registered. Therefore, only these stations offered a possibility to estimate the exact values of potential evapotranspiration, which is a component of the CWB algorithm. This limitation affects the quality of CWB raster maps, interpolated on the basis of the meteorological stations network for the entire country. However, the interpolation process itself may introduce errors; therefore, the adaptation of satellite data (that are spatially continuous) should be taken into account, even if the lack of data due to cloudiness remains a serious problem. In this paper, we involved the remote sensing data from MODIS instrument and considered the ability to integrate those data with values determined by using ground measurements. The paper presents results of comparisons for the CWB index assessed using ground station data and those obtained from potential evapotranspiration as the product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing instrument. The comparisons of results were performed for specific points (locations of ground stations) and were expressed by differences in means values. Analysis of Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), Mann-Kendal trend test (Z-index), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for ten years' series were evaluated and are presented. In addition, the basic spatial interpretation of results has been proposed. The correlation test revealed the r coefficient in the range from 0.06 to 0.68. The results show good trend agreement in time between two types of CWB with constantly higher values of this index, which is estimated using ground measurement data. In results for 34 (from 43 analyzed) stations the Mann-Kendal test provide the consistent trend, and only nine trends were inconsistent. Analyses revealed that the disagreement between the two considered indices (determined in different ways) increased significantly in the warmer period with a significant break point between R7 and R8 that falls at the end of May for each examined year. The value of MAE varied from 80 mm to 135 mm.

TI  - Use of Remotely Sensed Data to Enhance Estimation of Aboveground Biomass for the Dry Afromontane Forest in South-Central Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodic assessment of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential to regulate the impacts of the changing climate. However, AGB estimation using field-based sample survey (FBSS) has limited precision due to cost and accessibility constraints. Fortunately, remote sensing technologies assist to improve AGB estimation precisions. Thus, this study assessed the role of remotely sensed (RS) data in improving the precision of AGB estimation in an Afromontane forest in south-central Ethiopia. The research objectives were to identify RS variables that are useful for estimating AGB and evaluate the extent of improvement in the precision of the remote sensing-assisted AGB estimates beyond the precision of a pure FBSS. Reference AGB data for model calibration and estimation were collected from 111 systematically distributed circular sample plots (SPs) of 1000 m(2) area. Independent variables were derived from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images acquired in January 2019. The area-weighted mean and standard deviation of the spectral reflectance, spectral index and texture (only for PlanetScope) variables were extracted for each SP. A maximum of two independent variables from each image type was fitted to a generalized linear model for AGB estimation using model-assisted estimators. The results of this study revealed that the Landsat-8 model with the predictor variable of shortwave infrared band reflectance and the PlanetScope model with the predictor variable of green band reflectance had estimation efficiency of 1.40 and 1.37, respectively. Similarly, the Sentinel-2 model, which had predictor variables of shortwave infrared reflectance and standard deviation of green leaf index, improved AGB estimation with the relative efficiency of 1.68. Utilizing freely available Sentinel-2 data seems to enhance the AGB estimation efficiency and reduce cost and extensive fieldwork in inaccessible areas.

TI  - Structural and spectroscopic study of the kieserite-dwornikite solid-solution series, (Mg,Ni)SO<sub>4</sub>•H<sub>2</sub>O, at ambient and low temperatures, with cosmochemical implications for icy moons and Mars
T2  - AMERICAN MINERALOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of the presence and role of sulfates in our solar system receives growing attention because these compounds play a crucial role in the water budget of planets such as Mars and significantly influence melting equilibria on the icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter, leading to the formation of subsurface oceans and even cryovolcanism. Despite the dominant presence of higher sulfate hydrates such as epsomite, MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O, and mirabilite, Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, on these moons' surfaces, it is not excluded that lower-hydrated sulfates, such as kieserite, MgSO4 center dot H2O, are also present, forming from higher hydrates under pressures relevant to the mantle of the icy moons. Given the composition of the soluble fraction in C1 and C2 chondritic meteorites, which are high in Ni content and also considered to represent the composition of the rocky cores of the Jovian icy moons, the actual compositions of potentially present monohydrate sulfates likely lie at intermediate values along the solid-solution series between kieserite and transition-metal kieserite-group end-members, incorporating Ni in particular. Moderate Ni contents are also probable in kieserite on Mars due to the planet's long-term accumulation of meteoritic nickel, although likely to a much lesser extent than Fe.Structural and spectroscopic differences between the pure Mg- and Ni-end-members have been previously documented in the literature, but no detailed crystal chemical and spectroscopic investigation along the Mg-Ni solid solution has been done yet. The present work proves the existence of a continuous (Mg,Ni)SO4 center dot H2O solid-solution series for the first time. It provides a detailed insight into the changes in lattice parameters, structural details, and positions of prominent bands in infrared (transmission, attenuated total reflectance, diffuse reflectance) and Raman spectra in synthetic samples as the Ni/Mg ratio progresses, at both ambient as well as low temperatures relevant for the icy moons and Mars. UV-Vis-NIR crystal field spectra of the Ni end-member also help to elucidate the influence of Ni2+-related bands on the overtone- and combination modes.The (Mg,Ni)SO4 center dot H2O solid-solution series shows Vegard-type behavior, i.e., lattice parameters as well as spectral band positions, change along linear trends with increasing Ni content. Infrared spectra reveal significant changes in the wavenumber positions of prominent bands, depending on the Ni/Mg ratio. We show that the temperature during measurement also has an influence on band position, mainly in the case of H2O-related bands. The changes observed for several absorption features in the IR spectra enable rough estimation of the Ni/Mg ratio in the monohydrate sulfate, which is applicable to present and future remote sensing data, as well as in situ measurements on Mars or the icy moons. The spectral features most diagnostic of composition are the vibrational stretching modes of the H2O molecule and a band unique to kieserite-group compounds at around 900 cm(-1) in the IR spectra, as well as the pronounced nu(3) and nu 1 sulfate stretching modes visible in Raman spectra.

TI  - CA-Markov Chain Analysis of Seasonal Land Surface Temperature and Land Use Land Cover Change Using Optical Multi-Temporal Satellite Data of Faisalabad, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cellular Automata models are used for simulating spatial distributions and Markov Chain models are used for simulating temporal changes. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of urban growth on Faisalabad. This research is aimed at predicting seasonal Land-Surface-Temperature (LST) as well as Land-Use and Land-cover (LULC) with a Cellular-Automata-Markov-Chain (CA-Markov-Chain). Landsat 5, 7 and 8 data were used for mapping seasonal LULC and LST distributions during the months of May and November for the years 1990, 1998, 2004, 2008, 2013 and 2018. A CA-Markov-Chain was developed for simulating long-term landscape changes at 10-year time steps from 2018 to 2048. Furthermore, surface temperature during summers and winters were predicted well by Urban Index (UI), a non-vegetation index, demonstrating the highest correlation of R-2 = 0.8962 and R-2 = 0.9212 with respect to retrieved summer and winter surface temperature. Through the CA-Markov Chain analysis, we can expect that high density and low-density residential areas will grow from 22.23 to 24.52 km(2) and from 108.53 to 122.61 km(2) in 2018 and 2048, as inferred from the changes occurred from 1990 to 2018. Considering UI as the predictor of seasonal LST, we predicted that the summer and winter temperature 24-28 degrees C and 14-16 degrees C and regions would decrease in coverage from 10.75 to 3.14% and from 8.81 to 3.47% between 2018 and 2048, while the summer and winter temperature 35-42 degrees C and winter 26-32 degrees C regions will increase in the proportion covered from 12.69 to 24.17% and 6.75-15.15% of city.

TI  - Effect of injectable eprinomectin on milk quality and yield of dairy ewes naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to investigate the effect of injectable eprinomectin on milk yield and quality of dairy ewes naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes when grazing in communal pastures. Onehundred and fifty (150) clinically healthy adult lactating ewes, equally selected from 3 farms, were included in the study. On day -7, the ewes on each farm were randomly allocated into 2 equal groups of 25 animals (n=50): Control group (C) and Treated group (T). On day 0, ewes in group T were given a single subcutaneous injection of eprinomectin at a dose rate of 0.2 mg/kg bodyweight. Ewes in group C were left untreated during the whole experiment. Ewes in group T with a fecal egg count (FEC) >300 eggs per g on day +60 were treated again. Fecal samples were individually collected on days -7, 0, +30, +60, +90, +120 for FEC estimations and copmcultures. On days -7, 0, +30, +60 and +90, individual milk yield (MY) was recorded using ICAR approved volumetric milk meters. Energy corrected milk yield (ECMY) for 6% fat was also calculated. Moreover, individual milk samples were collected on each day for determination of chemical composition [fat (F%), protein (P%) and lactose (L%) content] and somatic cell counts (SCC). On each day, individual fat and protein yield (FY and PY, respectively) were calculated. Total lactation MY, total ECMY, total FY and total PY were computed. The most prevalent parasite at pre-treatment and post-treatment days was Haemonchus spp. The overall efficacy on days +30 and +90 was 97.27 % and 98.80 %, respectively. In two out of the three farms, 80 % and 91.3 % of T ewes received a second treatment on day +60, due to high parasitic burden. Treatment had a significant effect (P=0.033) on MY with an average benefit of 8%. No significant effects of treatment were observed on the other parameters, although values were constantly numerically higher for treated ewes compared to control ones. In this field trial, injectable eprinomectin had a high overall efficacy and a beneficial effect on daily milk yield.

TI  - Monitoring agriculture areas with satellite images and deep learning
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture applications rely on accurate land monitoring, especially paddy areas, for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field works or surveys performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and sparse. Agriculture monitoring systems are looking for sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing on satellite data for cheap and timely paddy mapping. The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous and intelligent system built on top of imagery data streams, which is available from low-Earth orbiting satellites, to differentiate crop areas from non-crop areas. However, such agriculture mapping framework poses unique challenges for satellite image processing, including the seasonal nature of crop, the complexity of spectral channels, and adversarial conditions such as cloud and solar radiance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-temporal high-spatial resolution classification method with an advanced spatiotemporal-spectral deep neural network to locate paddy fields at the pixel level for a whole year long and for each temporal instance. Our method is built and tested on the case study of Landsat 8 data due to its high spatial resolution. Empirical evaluations on real imagery datasets of different landscapes from 2016 to 2018 show the superior of our mapping model against the baselines with over 0.93 F1-score, the importance of each model design, the robustness against seasonal effects, and the visual mapping results.

TI  - Contemporary Snow Changes in the Karakoram Region Attributed to Improved MODIS Data between 2003 and 2018
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt significantly contributes to meltwater in most parts of High Mountain Asia. The Karakoram region is one of these densely glacierized and snow-covered regions. Several studies have reported that glaciers in the Karakoram region remained stable or experience slight mass loss. This trend has called for further investigation to understand changes in other components of the cryosphere. This study estimates the comparative snow cover area (SCA) and snowline altitude (SLA) changes between 2003 and 2018 in the Karakoram region and its subbasins, including Hunza, Shigar, and Shyok. We used three different 8-day composite snow products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in this study including (1) Original Aqua (MYD10A2), (2) Original Terra (MOD10A2), and (3) Improved Terra-Aqua (MOYDGL06*) snow products from 2003 to 2018. We used Mann-Kendall and Sen Slope methods to assess trends in the SCA and SLA. Our results show that the original snow products are significantly biased when investigating seasonal and annual trends. However, discarding a cloud cover of >20% in the original products improves the results and makes them more comparable to our improved snow product. The original products (without cloud removal) overestimate the SCA during summer and underestimate the SCA during winter and year-round throughout the Karakoram region. The bias in the mean annual SCA between improved and Aqua and Terra cloud threshold products for the Karakoram region is found to be -1.67% and 1.1%, respectively. The improved (MOYDGL06*) product reveals a statistically insignificant decreasing trend of the SCA on the annual scale between 2003 and 2018 in the Karakoram region and all three subbasins. The annual trends decreased at -0.13%, -0.1%, -0.08%, and -0.05% in the Karakoram, Hunza, Shigar, and Shyok, respectively. The monthly trends were slightly positive overall in December. The annual maximum SLA shows a statistically significant upward trend of 13 m above sea level (m a.s.l.) per year for the entire Karakoram region. This finding suggests a significant uncertainty in water resource planning based on the original snow data, and this study recommends the use of the improved snow product for a better understanding.

TI  - UAS Imagery-Based Mapping of Coarse Wood Debris in a Natural Deciduous Forest in Central Germany (Hainich National Park)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dead wood such as coarse dead wood debris (CWD) is an important component in natural forests since it increases the diversity of plants, fungi, and animals. It serves as habitat, provides nutrients and is conducive to forest regeneration, ecosystem stabilization and soil protection. In commercially operated forests, dead wood is often unwanted as it can act as an originator of calamities. Accordingly, efficient CWD monitoring approaches are needed. However, due to the small size of CWD objects satellite data-based approaches cannot be used to gather the needed information and conventional ground-based methods are expensive. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming increasingly important in the forestry sector since structural and spectral features of forest stands can be extracted from the high geometric resolution data they produce. As such, they have great potential in supporting regular forest monitoring and inventory. Consequently, the potential of UAS imagery to map CWD is investigated in this study. The study area is located in the center of the Hainich National Park (HNP) in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany. The HNP features natural and unmanaged forest comprising deciduous tree species such as Fagus sylvatica (beech), Fraxinus excelsior (ash), Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore maple), and Carpinus betulus (hornbeam). The flight campaign was controlled from the Hainich eddy covariance flux tower located at the Eastern edge of the test site. Red-green-blue (RGB) image data were captured in March 2019 during leaf-off conditions using off-the-shelf hardware. Agisoft Metashape Pro was used for the delineation of a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud, which formed the basis for creating a canopy-free RGB orthomosaic and mapping CWD. As heavily decomposed CWD hardly stands out from the ground due to its low height, it might not be detectable by means of 3D geometric information. For this reason, solely RGB data were used for the classification of CWD. The mapping task was accomplished using a line extraction approach developed within the object-based image analysis (OBIA) software eCognition. The achieved CWD detection accuracy can compete with results of studies utilizing high-density airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based point clouds. Out of 180 CWD objects, 135 objects were successfully delineated while 76 false alarms occurred. Although the developed OBIA approach only utilizes spectral information, it is important to understand that the 3D information extracted from our UAS data is a key requirement for successful CWD mapping as it provides the foundation for the canopy-free orthomosaic created in an earlier step. We conclude that UAS imagery is an alternative to laser data in particular if rapid update and quick response is required. We conclude that UAS imagery is an alternative to laser data for CWD mapping, especially when a rapid response and quick reaction, e.g., after a storm event, is required.

TI  - Using NASA Earth observations and Google Earth Engine to map winter cover crop conservation performance in the Chesapeake Bay watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter cover crops such as barley, rye, and wheat help to improve soil structure by increasing porosity, aggregate stability, and organic matter, while reducing the loss of agricultural nutrients and sediments into waterways. The environmental performance of cover crops is affected by choice of species, planting date, planting method, nutrient inputs, temperature, and precipitation. The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) oversees an agricultural cost-share program that provides farmers with funding to cover costs associated with planting winter cover crops, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) have partnered with the MDA to develop satellite remote sensing techniques for measuring cover crop performance. The MDA has developed the capacity to digitize field boundaries for all fields enrolled in their cover crop programs (> 26,000 fields per year) to support a remote sensing performance analysis at a statewide scal,e and has requested assistance with the associated imagery processing from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, scripts were developed to process Landsat 5/7/8 and Harmonized Sentinel-2 imagery to measure winter cover crop performance. We calibrated cover crop performance models using linear regression between satellite vegetation indices and USGS / USDA-ARS field sampling data collected on Maryland farms between 2006 and 2012 (1298 samples). Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values showed significant correlation with the natural logarithm of cover crop biomass (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.56) and with observed percent vegetative ground cover (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.68). The GEE scripts were used to composite seasonal maximum NDVI values for each enrolled cover crop field and calculate performance metrics for the winter and spring seasons of three enrollment years (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2017-18) for four Maryland counties. Results from winter 2017-18 demonstrate that rye and barley fields had higher biomass than wheat fields, and that early planting, along with planting methods that increase seed-soil contact, increased performance. The processing capabilities of GEE will support the MDA in scaling up remote sensing performance analysis statewide, providing information to evaluate the environmental outcomes associated with various agronomic management strategies. The tool can be modified for different seasonal cutoffs, utilize new sensors to capture phenology in winter and spring, and scale to larger regions for use in adaptive management of winter cover crops planted for environmental benefit.

TI  - Fusion Approach for Remotely-Sensed Mapping of Agriculture (FARMA): A Scalable Open Source Method for Land Cover Monitoring Using Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of very-high resolution (VHR; <2 m) imagery has the potential to enable agricultural monitoring at increased resolution and cadence, particularly when used in combination with widely available moderate-resolution imagery. However, scaling limitations exist at the regional level due to big data volumes and processing constraints. Here, we demonstrate the Fusion Approach for Remotely-Sensed Mapping of Agriculture (FARMA), using a suite of open source software capable of efficiently characterizing time-series field-scale statistics across large geographical areas at VHR resolution. We provide distinct implementation examples in Vietnam and Senegal to demonstrate the approach using WorldView VHR optical, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, and Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 optical imagery. This distributed software is open source and entirely scalable, enabling large area mapping even with modest computing power. FARMA provides the ability to extract and monitor sub-hectare fields with multisensor raster signals, which previously could only be achieved at scale with large computational resources. Implementing FARMA could enhance predictive yield models by delineating boundaries and tracking productivity of smallholder fields, enabling more precise food security observations in low and lower-middle income countries.

TI  - Impact of Neoadjuvant Versus Adjuvant Chemotherapy on the Extent of Axillary Surgery for Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancers of Triple-Negative and HER2-Overexpressing Phenotypes
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer are evolving. This retrospective analysis of National Cancer Data Base cases from 2012 to 2015 demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the rate of axillary lymph node dissection in clinically node-negative patients with nonluminal breast cancers. By reducing the extent of axillary surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may prevent unnecessary morbidities.Background: Breast cancer patients with triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)overexpressing phenotypes are recommended to receive chemotherapy for primary tumors greater than 1 cm regardless of nodal status. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may eradicate subclinical nodal metastases and reduce the extent of axillary surgery performed. Patients and Methods: A query of the National Cancer Database Participant User File was performed for new cases of female breast cancer from 2012 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were clinical NO status, receipt of chemotherapy, and receipt of axillary surgery. Exclusions included hormone-positive/HER2-negative tumors and/or distant metastatic disease. Subjects were divided into groups by receipt of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary end point was the extent of axillary surgery, defined as sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Subgroup analyses were performed on the basis of tumor phenotype and surgery of the primary site. Results: A total of 66,771 female patients were included, 15,967 of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ALND rates were higher in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (30.6% vs. 28.8%, P < .001). Among tumor phenotypes, the extent of axillary surgery was reduced most significantly for hormone-negative, HER2-positive disease (30.0% vs. 25.8%, P < .001). ALND rates were more substantially reduced for patients who underwent mastectomy (41.3% vs. 36.1%, P < .001) compared to partial mastectomy (21.8% vs. 20.1%, P = .002). Adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent predictor of ALND (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.33). Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the extent of axillary surgery in clinically node-negative, nonluminal breast cancers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparing satellite and helicopter-based methods for observing crevasses, application in East Antarctica
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing where crevasses are is critical for planning safe on-ice field operations. Previous methods have ranged from real-time imaging of subsurface structures using ground penetrating radar, to mapping of crevasses over large areas using satellite imagery, with each method having it's own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper we compare the detection of crevasses at the Totten Glacier, East Antarctica, from helicopter-borne ground penetrating radar with satellite-based microwave synthetic aperture radar imagery. Our results show that the 80 MHz helicopter-borne ground penetrating radar was able to detect crevasses up to a depth of 70 m, with snow bridge thickness of 30 m. Comparison with TerraSAR-X (X-band, 9.6 GHz) satellite imagery indicates that the latter is highly effective, detecting 100% of crevasses with snow bridges of up to 4m thick and detecting 95% of crevasses with snow bridges up to 10 m thick. The ability of both methods to identify individual crevasses is affected by several factors including crevasse geometry, survey or satellite orientation and snow moisture content, and further experiments are planned to investigate performance under a wider range of conditions.

TI  - New approach of water quantity vulnerability assessment using satellite images and GIS-based model: An application to a case study in Vietnam
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water deficiency due to climate change and the world's population growth increases the demand for the water industry to carry out vulnerability assessments. Although many studies have been done on climate change vulnerability assessment, a specific framework with sufficient indicators for water vulnerability assessment is still lacking. This highlights the urgent need to devise an effective model framework in order to provide water managers and authorities with the level of water exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and water vulnerability to formulate their responses in implementing water management strategies. The present study proposes a new approach for water quantity vulnerability assessment based on remote sensing satellite data and GIS ModelBuilder. The developed approach has three layers: (1) data acquisition mainly from remote sensing datasets and statistical sources; (2) calculation layer based on the integration of GIS-based model and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's vulnerability assessment framework; and (3) output layer including the indices of exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and water vulnerability and spatial distribution of remote sensing indicators and these indices in provincial and regional scale. In total 27 indicators were incorporated for the case study in Vietnam based on their availability and reliability. Results show that the most water vulnerable is the South Central Coast of the country, followed by the Northwest area. The novel approach is based on reliable and updated spatial-temporal datasets (soil water stress, aridity index, water use efficiency, rain use efficiency and leaf area index), and the incorporation of the GIS-based model. This framework can then be applied effectively for water vulnerability assessment of other regions and countries. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Shoreline Changes Along the Coast of Mainland China-Time to Pause and Reflect?
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline changes are of great importance for evaluating the interaction between humans and ecosystems in coastal areas. They serve as a useful metric for assessing the ecological costs of socioeconomic developmental activities along the coast. In this paper, we present an assessment of shoreline changes along the eastern coast of mainland China from similar to 1990 to 2019 by applying a novel method recently developed by us. This method which we call the Nearest Distance Method (NDM) is used to make a detailed assessment of shorelines delineated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The results indicate a dramatic decline in natural shorelines that correspond to the rapid increase in the construction of artificial shorelines, driven by China's economic growth. Of the entire coast of mainland China, the biggest change occurred along the Bohai Sea, where artificial shorelines expanded from 42.4% in similar to 1990 to 81.5% in 2019. Over this period, this study indicates that China lost > 60% of its biological shorelines, a trend that is especially worrisome because these include areas that were once biologically diverse and extremely rich. As anticipated, shoreline losses were greatest where regions of low economic value had been transformed to areas of higher economic value. Overall, this influence of human activities on shorelines in China is unprecedented. The repercussions of these changes on ecosystems, and the susceptibility of new shoreline developments to population growth and sea-level rise, need to be assessed urgently before additional changes are effected.

TI  - The problem of vaccination refusal: a review with guidance for pediatricians
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review In the wake of multiple recent outbreaks of the measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, it is crucial to understand and address parental concerns about vaccination. The purposes of this review are: to identify the causes of vaccine resistance, to elucidate the variables that have led to the success or failure of interventions to date, and to consider implications for pediatricians treating children whose parents are vaccination-resistant. Recent findings Recent research draws on insights from cognitive science to understand vaccine resistance and to develop more effective interventions. Studies show that vaccine resistors are more likely to value lifestyle liberty, to favor individualistic over hierarchical worldviews, and to believe in conspiracy theories. Interventions that seek primarily to correct erroneous beliefs about the dangers of vaccination are likely to fail or even backfire. On the other hand, intervention strategies, such as motivational interviewing, in which the provider elicits and shows respect for parents' values and concerns while empowering them to make well informed and well reasoned decisions, are more likely to be successful. Parents cite a trusting relationship with their pediatrician as the most important factor influencing their decision to vaccinate. Pediatricians are in the best position to successfully apply insights from cognitive science and intervention research to overcome vaccination-hesitancy.

This is essential information for understanding the eruption history of lava fields, and magmatic processes beneath the surface of Earth and other planetary bodies such as the Moon. The surface morphology is influenced by lava properties such as viscosity, temperature, composition, and rate of shear. In this work, we seek to understand how we can interpret the emplacement processes and lava properties of lava flows using remote sensing data. Craters of the Moon (COTM) National Monument and Preserve in Idaho hosts a suite of compositionally diverse lava flows with a wide range of surface roughness making it the ideal case study. Lava flows there have surface morphologies consistent with smooth pahoehoe, slabby pahoehoe, hummocky pahoehoe, rubbly pahoehoe, 'a'(a) over bar, block-'a'(a) over bar, and blocky textures. The variation in surface roughness across the lava field reflects changes in lava properties and/or emplacement processes over space and time. We investigate geochemical and petrographic variations of the different lava flow morphologies and analyse how they relate to airborne radar data. Results show L-Band (24 cm) radar circular polarization ratios (CPR) distinguish the contrasting surface roughness a COTM, separating the smoother (primitive; low SiO2 and alkali) and rougher (evolved; high SiO2 and alkali) lava flows. However, ambiguities are present when comparing the CPR values for rubbly pahoehoe and block-'a'(a) over bar flow. Even though their CPR values appear similar at the decimetre scale, they have distinct morphologies that formed under different emplacement processes. Without ground-truth information, the rubbly pahoehoe and block-'a'(a) over bar lava flows could therefore be misinterpreted to be the same type of flow morphology, which would lead to false interpretations about their lava properties and emplacement processes. This is important when comparing these flows to lava flows on other planetary bodies that share similar CPR values, such as the Moon. Thus, using terrestrial analogues such as those at COTM can provide an improved understanding of the surface morphology and emplacement processes of lunar lava flows. This will lead to more refined interpretations about past volcanic processes on the Moon.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrievals by Combining Passive Microwave and Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to retrieve the temporal dynamics of soil moisture from 2015 to 2019 over an agricultural site in Southeast Australia using the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) brightness temperature. To meet this objective, two machine learning approaches, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), as well as a statistical Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model were established, with the auxiliary data including the 16-day composite MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1) and Surface Temperature (ST). The entire data were divided into two parts corresponding to ascending (6:00 p.m. local time) and descending (6:00 a.m. local time) orbits of SMAP overpasses. Thus, the three models were trained using the descending data acquired during the five years (2015 to 2019), and validated using the ascending product of the same period. Consequently, three different temporal variations of the soil moisture were obtained based on the three models. To evaluate their accuracies, the retrieved soil moisture was compared against the SMAP level-2 soil moisture product, as well as to in-situ ground station data. The comparative results show that the soil moisture obtained using the OLS, RF and SVM algorithms are highly correlated to the SMAP level-2 product, with high coefficients of determination (R-OLS(2) = 0.981, R-SVM(2) = 0.943, R-RF(2) = 0.983) and low RMSE (RMSEOLS = 0.016 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSESVM = 0.047 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSERF = 0.016 cm(3)/cm(3)). Meanwhile, the estimated soil moistures agree with in-situ station data across different years (R-OLS(2) = 0.376 similar to 0.85, R-SVM(2) = 0.376 similar to 0.814, R-RF(2) = 0.39 similar to 0.854; RMSEOLS = 0.049 similar to 0.105 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSESVM = 0.073 similar to 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSERF = 0.047 similar to 0.102 cm(3)/cm(3)), but an overestimation issue is observed for high vegetation conditions. The RF algorithm outperformed the SVM and OLS, in terms of the agreement with the ground measurements. This study suggests an alternative soil moisture retrieval scheme, in complementary to the SMAP baseline algorithm, for a fast soil moisture retrieval.

TI  - Lithological and alteration mineral mapping for alluvial gold exploration in the south east of Birao area, Central African Republic using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological field mapping and mineral exploration still remain very laborious in many parts of the inter tropical regions of African plate due to remoteness, low security and high cost. Currently, a number of remote sensing satellite imagery are freely available and can be broadly used for lithological mapping and mineral exploration in inaccessible regions of African plate. The Birao region of the Central African Republic is well known for its alluvial deposits of gold and copper. The Birao region is located in subtropical belt of Africa plate. In this study, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery was used for lithological and alteration mapping in the south-eastern part (inaccessible zone) of Birao region for alluvial gold exploration. Image processing techniques such as False Color Composite (FCC), Band Ratio (BR), Principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) were executed to extract spectral information related to lithological units and alteration minerals. Clay and carbonate minerals, iron oxides, ferrous silicates and lithological units, including the Neo-Chadian Formation, the Lower Proterozoic Formations and the Recent Alluvial Formation were identified and discriminated in the study area. The band ratio of 6/7, 4/2 and 6/5 were typically used to map clay, iron oxides and ferrous silicates, respectively. The results of band ratio and PCA techniques were integrated with fuzzy logic modeling that considerably highlighted hydrothermal alteration minerals and high perspective zones for alluvial gold exploration. Additionally, an updated lithological-mineralogical map was generated for south-eastern part of the Birao region by fusing the FCC, MNF and SAM techniques. Comparison with previous lithological map of the study area, virtual verification, fieldwork and laboratory data confirmed good rate of accuracy for the result obtained from the Landsat-8 OLI satellite data. The approach presented in this study is a low-cost technique that highly applicable for lithological mapping and mineral exploration in remote subtropical regions of African plate.

TI  - Developing a framework for using Earth Observation imagery to monitor peatland condition.
T2  - JNCC Report
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland restoration is a significant target of a number of key policy areas within all four UK administrations. Developing cost-effective methods for monitoring key indicators of peatland condition, such as; vegetation cover of Sphagnum mosses, areas of bare unvegetated peat, soil depth and drainage, can help to inform the targeting of restoration strategies and establish whether efforts are successful in promoting recovery (SNH 2020). This report investigates the use of earth observation data for monitoring peatland condition through exploring whether the amount of bare peat cover can be detected in an automated process from very high-resolution imagery (aerial and satellite) and how this can then be scaled up to lower resolution satellite imagery covering a wider extent. This report outlines a framework for mapping bare peat which includes ways of determining the amount of imagery required to inform models and the best modelling approach for accurate predictions of bare peat cover using machine learning algorithms. Firstly, we investigated whether Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery or aerial photography can be used to develop a methodology for automating bare peat detection. We compared data from Pleiades-1A satellite imagery and Aerial Photography for Great Britain (APGB) taken over the Peak District, UK in June 2018 and explored differences in spectral band and derived indices signatures between observed vegetated and non-vegetated regions of peat. Thresholding rules were then developed to classify pixels of bare peat in the two sets of imagery. Secondly, we investigated whether the modelled bare peat from the VHR imagery could be used to predict bare peat cover over wider areas using low resolution Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The classified pixels from VHR data were aggregated to a percentage cover of bare peat at 10m spatial resolution. These data were used to train regression models to predict bare peat cover within Sentinel-2 imagery, allowing prediction over a much wider spatial extent. A variety of different predictor variables and machine learning algorithms were trialled, along with the sampling methodologies for selecting training points and the number of points required for an accurate prediction. The results of our first investigation showed that the APGB aerial photography displayed distinguishable differences between areas of vegetated and non-vegetated peat, and through thresholding derived indices of NDVI, Brightness, Red/Green and Red/Blue ratios was able to create fine-scale maps of bare peat. However, the methodology was unable to distinguish the bare peat pixels using the Pleiades imagery due to overlap in the spectral and indices signatures when compared with vegetated pixels. In addition, for both data sources, using a pixel-based indices thresholding approach to classify land areas had some limitations, with some neighbouring pixels not meeting threshold criteria as expected, and thresholding rules having limited transferability to different geographical areas. This was likely due to differences in atmospheric conditions, hill shade, blurriness from wind, and sun illumination during different flights impacting the spectral band values. Our research identified several options to address these deficiencies, which could be explored to help improve the fine-scale mapping approach. The results of our second investigation showed that regression modelling informed by the fine-scale bare peat maps and Sentinel-2 imagery, successfully scaled up these predictions to a wider landscape, producing maps of the amount of bare peat cover per 10m pixel. From our results, we recommend the following workflow (Figure 1) of how best to inform this type of analysis. Training the models with a range of values of bare peat cover per pixel was found to be key in generating accurate results, particularly in extrapolated regions. From this we demonstrate how Sentinel-2 imagery trained on aerial photography derived data, can be used to predict across large areas of the landscape the fraction of bare peat cover below 10m<sup>2</sup>. Highest accuracy was achieved where aerial photography was spatially distributed across an area and contained a range of pristine and degraded peatland conditions.

TI  - A Time-Efficient Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation Method Using the Dynamic Vegetation Growth Information From Time Series GLASS FVC Product
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important land surface parameter for many environmental and climate-related modeling and agricultural applications. Incorporating vegetation growth information into FVC estimation process could effectively improve FVC estimation accuracy. Methods utilizing vegetation growth information from field measurement and coarse resolution FVC product have been developed recently to estimate site-scale and finer spatial resolution FVC, and achieved satisfactory performances. However, the computational efficiency of these methods is not satisfactory and they are only feasible for analyzing historical data containing a complete vegetation growth cycle. This letter developed a time-efficient FVC estimation method at Landsat scale based on temporally rich data from coarse spatial resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC, which facilitates development of a time-efficient dynamic vegetation growth model, and radiative transfer models linking Landsat 7 reflectance to FVC, and all combined in a probabilistic dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) framework. In addition, the proposed method is also suitable for real-time FVC estimation and has the potential to be applied on a larger scale. Validation results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactory (R-2 = 0.889, RMSE = 0.0917) and comparable to previously developed inefficient but well-established FVC estimation method incorporating the vegetation growth model represented by modified Verhulst logistic equation (R-2 = 0.884, RMSE = 0.0913).

TI  - Mysterianism and the Division of Epistemic Labour
T2  - FILOZOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mysterianism has become a popular stance in philosophy of consciousness and other philosophical subdisciplines. The aim of this paper is to show that mysterianism is not justified, mainly because its inclination to epistemic defeatism and the misunderstanding of the division of epistemic labour. In the first part, I will present the history of mysterianism in the 19th and 20th century philosophy. Then, in the second part, I will point out how epistemic defeatism is founded in the unwarranted philosophical futurology. The third part will deal with the division of labour in society, language and knowledge. Because of the division of epistemic labour, the understanding is distributed among numerous agents without possibility of individual comprehension. Finally, I will coin the term "ignorance illusion" that plays the central role in the mysterians' worldview.

TI  - Surface Roughness Estimation in the Orog Nuur Basin (Southern Mongolia) Using Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series and Ground-Based Photogrammetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates an application-oriented approach to estimate area-wide surface roughness from Sentinel-1 time series in the semi-arid environment of the Orog Nuur Basin (southern Mongolia) to support recent geomorphological mapping efforts. The relation of selected mono- and multi-temporal SAR features and roughness is investigated by using an empirical multi-model approach and selected 1D and 2D surface roughness indices. These indices were obtained from 48 high-resolution ground-based photogrammetric digital elevation models, which were acquired during a single field campaign. The analysis is backed by a time series analysis, comparing Sentinel-1 features to temporal-corresponding observations and reanalysis datasets on soil moisture conditions, land surface temperature, occurrence of precipitation events, and presence and development of vegetation. Results show that Sentinel-1 features are hardly sensitive to the changing surface conditions over none to sparsely vegetated land, indicating very dry conditions throughout the year. Consequently, surface roughness is the dominating factor altering SAR intensity. The best correlation is found for the combined surface roughness index Z-Value (ratio between the root mean square height and the correlation length) and the mean summer VH intensity with an r(2) coefficient of 0.83 and an Root-Mean-Square Error of 0.032.

TI  - Sentinel Node Imaging and Radioguided Surgery in the Era of SPECT/CT and PET/CT Toward New Interventional Nuclear Medicine Strategies
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We review recent technological advances and new clinical indications for sentinel node (SN) and radioguided surgery in order to delineate future tendencies of interventional nuclear medicine in this field. A literature research was performed in PubMed to select relevant articles to be used as key references for analysis of the current approaches and tendencies in SN and radioguided surgery, as well as the evolving contribution of nuclear medicine intervention techniques to the various clinical applications. For classic indications such as melanoma and breast cancer, the incorporation of the SN approach based on the combined use of existing and new preoperative and intraoperative technologies in high-risk patient categories is becoming an emerging area of clinical indication. For SN biopsy staging in other malignancies with more complex lymphatic drainage, the incorporation of sophisticated tools is most helpful. The consecutive use of PET/CT and the SN procedure is increasing as a potential combined approach for the management of specific areas such as the axilla and the pelvis in patients at high risk of regional dissemination. Also, for the management of locoregional metastasis and oligometastatic disease, interventional nuclear medicine techniques are becoming valuable alternatives. The extended experience with SN biopsy is leading to technological advances facilitating the incorporation of this procedure to stage other malignancies with complex lymphatic drainage. New nuclear medicine-based approaches, incorporating SPECT/CT and PET/CT to guide resection of SNs and occult metastases, have recently been gaining ground.

TI  - Preoperative breast MRI in management of patients with needle biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 20-25% of patients with biopsy-proven DCIS underestimation occurs. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is offered to patients with biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and a high risk of occult invasive cancer. However, assessment of high risk is controversial. We aimed to improve selection of patients for SLNB with preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods: In this prospective observational study, MRI was offered to all subsequent patients with a biopsy-proven DCIS admitted to a large Dutch teaching hospital between April 2012 and March 2017. MRI images were analysed for signs of invasive cancer and the results were compared with the pathologic results after surgical treatment. The diagnostic accuracy of additional MRI in detecting occult invasive cancer was determined.Results: Of 211 patients eligible for additional MRI analysis, 149 underwent breast MRI. The majority (67%) received breast-conserving therapy, and the underestimation rate was 20%. Subsequent to MRI analysis, 20 additional invasive diagnostic procedures were performed. Occult invasive cancer was suspected on MRI in 46 patients (31%) and was confirmed in 18 (12%). In this study, breast MRI had a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 77%, and a true negative rate of 91%.Conclusion: Preoperative breast MRI cannot reliably predict the presence of invasive cancer in patients with biopsy proven DCIS. Therefore, it cannot be used to in the selection of patients for a SLNB. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in People With Asthma: A National Test-Negative Design Case-Control Study
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Influenza infection is a trigger of asthma attacks. Influenza vaccination can potentially reduce the incidence of influenza in people with asthma, but uptake remains persistently low, partially reflecting concerns about vaccine effectiveness (VE).Methods. We conducted a test-negative designed case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in people with asthma in Scotland over 6 seasons (2010/2011 to 2015/2016). We used individual patient-level data from 223 practices, which yielded 1 830 772 patient-years of data that were linked with virological (n = 5910 swabs) data.Results. Vaccination was associated with an overall 55.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.8-62.7) risk reduction of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in people with asthma over 6 seasons. There were substantial variations in VE between seasons, influenza strains, and age groups. The highest VE (76.1%; 95% CI, 55.6-87.1) was found in the 2010/2011 season, when the A(H1N1) strain dominated and there was a good antigenic vaccine match. High protection was observed against the A(H1N1) (eg, 2010/2011; 70.7%; 95% CI, 32.5-87.3) and B strains (eg, 2010/2011; 83.2%; 95% CI, 44.3-94.9), but there was lower protection for the A(H3N2) strain (eg, 2014/2015; 26.4%; 95% CI, -12.0 to 51.6). The highest VE against all viral strains was observed in adults aged 18-54 years (57.0%; 95% CI, 42.3-68.0).Conclusions. Influenza vaccination gave meaningful protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza in people with asthma across all seasons. Strategies to boost influenza vaccine uptake have the potential to substantially reduce influenza-triggered asthma attacks.

TI  - Opportunities for seagrass research derived from remote sensing: A review of current methods
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Seagrass communities provide critical ecosystem and provisioning services for both human populations and a wide range of associated species globally. However, it has been reported that seagrass area is decreasing at a rapid rate in many parts of the world, mostly due to anthropogenic activities including global change (pollution and climate change). The aim of this review article is to highlight the range of current tools for studying seagrasses as well as identify the benefits and limitations of a range of remote sensing and traditional methodologies. This paper provides a discussion of the ecological importance of seagrass meadows, and recent trends and developments in seagrass research methods are discussed including the use of satellite images and aerial photographs for seagrass monitoring and various image processing steps that are frequently utilised for seagrass mapping. The extensive use of various optical, Radar and LiDAR data for seagrass research in recent years has also been described in detail. The review concludes that the recent explosion of new methods and tools available from a wide range of platforms combined with the recent recognition of the importance of seagrasses provides the research community with an excellent opportunity to undertake a range of timely research. This research should include mapping the extent and distribution of seagrasses, identifying the drivers of change and factors that confer resilience, as well as quantification of the ecosystem services provided. Whilst remotely sensed data provides an important new tool it should be used in conjunction with traditional methods for validation and with a knowledge of the limitations of results and careful interpretation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of LANDSAT Satellite Imagery for Change Detection in Cesma Forest Ecosystem
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of remote sensing and increased availability of satellite imagery of different spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric characteristics makes information obtained from such sources of vital importance for studying and mapping vegetation. Vegetation indices have a significant role in vegetation change detection and tracking, whether in quantity or quality terms. Each index has specific significance and performance characteristics. A multiple regression statistical analysis of average vegetation index values (NDVI, NDWI, GNDVI, EVI and SAVI) was performed for 2012, 2013 and 2014 periods of a wider Cesma forest area near Vrbovec, Croatia. Further, rasters using three-year average values, sums, variances and standard deviations for all five indices were created. Differencing of average NDVI index values for years 2005 and 2014 was also performed. Imagery chosen was from the active vegetation period and used as a basis for cluster analysis detection of significant change areas. Cesma forest area was selected due to previous field monitoring and point analysis conducted (2012, 2013 and 2014) that serve as validation for this research. Finally, a raster analysis of select areas, surrounding accumulation dam and encompassing Cesma forest area exclusively, was conducted. The intention was determining vegetation index change dynamics. Spaciotemporal analysis around accumulation dams determined vegetation changes in dam areas. The advantage of the applied method is that, by using the Principal Components Analysis - PCA, it allows change detection, tracking and monitoring on wide areas more promptly than with other methods. The analysis itself was made using 92 LANDSAT images acquired over a 10-year period.

TI  - Multitemporal Analysis of Deforestation in Response to the Construction of the Tucurui Dam
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of hydroelectric dams that is planned, and under construction, in the Amazon basin is a proposal to generate "clean" energy, with the purposes of meeting the regional energy demand, and the insertion of Brazil into the international economic market. However, this type of megaproject can change the dynamics of natural ecosystems. In the present article, the spatiotemporal patterns of deforestation according to distance from the reservoir in the vicinity of the lake of Tucurui, and within a radius of 30 km from it, are analyzed. A linear spectral mixture model of segmented Landsat-thematic mapper (TM), enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and operational land imager (OLI) images, and proximity analysis were used for the mapping of the land-cover classes in the vicinity of the artificial lake of Tucurui. Likewise, landscape metrics were determined with the purpose of quantifying the reduction of primary forest, as a mechanism of loss of ecosystem services in the region. These methods were also used for the evaluation of the influence of the distance from the reservoir on the expansion of anthropogenic activities. This methodology was used for the scenarios of pre-inauguration, completion of phase I, beginning of construction phase II, full completion of the Tucurui hydroelectric project, and the current scenario of the region. The results showed that the highest deforestation rate occurred in the first period of the analysis, due to the areas submerged by the reservoir and due to the anthropogenic disturbances, such as timber extraction, road construction, and the conversion of forests into large areas of agribusiness.

TI  - National Scale Land Cover Classification for Ecosystem Services Mapping and Assessment, Using Multitemporal Copernicus EO Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-Use/Land-Cover (LULC) products are a common source of information and a key input for spatially explicit models of ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand. Global, continental, and regional, readily available, and free land-cover products generated through Earth Observation (EO) data, can be potentially used as relevant to ES mapping and assessment processes from regional to national scales. However, several limitations exist in these products, highlighting the need for timely land-cover extraction on demand, that could replace or complement existing products. This study focuses on the development of a classification workflow for fine-scale, object-based land cover mapping, employed on terrestrial ES mapping, within the Greek terrestrial territory. The processing was implemented in the Google Earth Engine cloud computing environment using 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Furthermore, the relevance of different training data extraction strategies and temporal EO information for increasing the classification accuracy was also evaluated. The different classification schemes demonstrated differences in overall accuracy ranging from 0.88% to 4.94% with the most accurate classification scheme being the manual sampling/monthly feature classification achieving a 79.55% overall accuracy. The classification results suggest that existing LULC data must be cautiously considered for automated extraction of training samples, in the case of new supervised land cover classifications aiming also to discern complex vegetation classes. The code used in this study is available on GitHub and runs on the Google Earth Engine web platform.

TI  - Periglacial vegetation dynamics in Arctic Russia: decadal analysis of tundra regeneration on landslides with time series satellite imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in vegetation productivity based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have been reported from Arctic regions. Most studies use very coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data that cannot isolate landscape level factors. For example, on Yamal Peninsula in West Siberia enhanced willow growth has been linked to widespread landslide activity, but the effect of landslides on regional NDVI dynamics is unknown. Here we apply a novel satellite-based NDVI analysis to investigate the vegetation regeneration patterns of active-layer detachments following a major landslide event in 1989. We analyzed time series data of Landsat and very high-resolution (VHR) imagery from QuickBird-2 and WorldView-2 and 3 characterizing a study area of ca. 35 km(2). Landsat revealed that natural regeneration of low Arctic tundra progressed rapidly during the first two decades after the landslide event. However, during the past decade, the difference between landslide shear surfaces and surrounding areas remained relatively unchanged despite the advance of vegetation succession. Time series also revealed that NDVI generally declined since 2013 within the study area. The VHR imagery allowed detection of NDVI change 'hot-spots' that included temporary degradation of vegetation cover, as well as new and expanding thaw slumps, which were too small to be detected from Landsat satellite data. Our study demonstrates that landslides can have pronounced and long-lasting impacts on tundra vegetation. Thermokarst landslides and associated impacts on vegetation will likely become increasingly common in NW Siberia and other Arctic regions with continued warming.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Coconut Trees in Tonga Using Very High Spatial Resolution WorldView-3 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a simple and efficient image processing method for estimating the number of coconut trees in the Tonga region using very high spatial resolution data (30 cm) in the blue, green, red and near infrared spectral bands acquired by the WorldView-3 sensor. The method is based on the detection of tree shadows and the further analysis to reject false detection using geometrical properties of the derived segments. The algorithm is evaluated by comparing coconut tree counts derived by an expert through photo-interpretation over 57 randomly distributed (4% sampling rate) segments of 200 m x 200 m over the Vaini region of the Tongatapu island. The number of detected trees agreed within 5% versus validation data. The proposed method was also evaluated over the whole Tonga archipelago by comparing satellite-derived estimates to the 2015 agricultural census data-the total tree counts for both Tonga and Tongatapu agreed within 3%.

TI  - Impact of a Two-Filter Cerebral Embolic Protection Device on the Complexity and Risk of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
T2  - THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is a growing use of cerebral protection devices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We aimed to analyze if the use of these devices itself has an impact on the complexity and the risk of TAVR.Methods Between February 2016 and July 2017, 391 patients underwent transfemoral TAVR with Medtronic CoreValve Evolut R ( n =196) or Edwards Sapien 3 ( n =195). In 39 patients, the Claret Sentinel (TM) embolic protection device (CS-EPD) was used. Prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed, comparing fluoroscopy/operation time, amount of contrast used, vascular events, and postprocedural renal function in TAVR patients with ( n =39) and without ( n =352) CS-EPD.Results The CS-EPD was placed through the right radial ( n =35) or brachial ( n =4) artery. Procedural success rate defined as correct deployment and retraction of both filters was 94.9%. No device-related vascular complications occurred. TAVR patients with CS-EPD showed a significantly higher total operation time, total fluoroscopy time, and amount of used contrast (85.439.3 vs. 64 +/- 29.8minutes, p =0.002; 20.7 +/- 9.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 7minutes, p <= 0.001; 133.7 +/- 42.6 vs. 109.7 +/- 44.5mL, p =0.001). Comparing the initial third of patients receiving a CS-EPD with the last third of CS-EPD cases, procedural time had decreased significantly (102.5 +/- 34.9 vs. 67 +/- 11.9; p =0.002). There were no differences in postprocedural renal failure ( p =0.80).Conclusion Our data add evidence that the application of the CS-EPD is not associated with an additional risk for the patient. Although procedural time and amount of contrast are still higher when using the CS-EPD, there were no device-related complications or increased incidence of renal failure.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Cross Ratio and Vegetation Optical Depth: A Comparison over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation products based on microwave remote sensing observations, such as Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), are increasingly used in a variety of applications. One disadvantage is the often coarse spatial resolution of tens of kilometers of products retrieved from microwave observations from spaceborne radiometers and scatterometers. This can potentially be overcome by using new high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from Sentinel-1. However, the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter to vegetation dynamics, or its use in radiative transfer models, such as the water cloud model, has only been tested at field to regional scale. In this study, we compared the cross-polarization ratio (CR) to vegetation dynamics as observed in microwave-based Vegetation Optical Depth from coarse-scale satellites over Europe. CR was obtained from Sentinel-1 VH and VV backscatter observations at 500 m sampling and resampled to the spatial resolution of VOD from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the Metop satellite series. Spatial patterns between median CR and ASCAT VOD correspond to each other and to vegetation patterns over Europe. Analysis of temporal correlation between CR and ASCAT VOD shows that high Pearson correlation coefficients (Rp) are found over croplands and grasslands (median Rp > 0.75). Over deciduous broadleaf forests, negative correlations are found. This is attributed to the effect of structural changes in the vegetation canopy which affect CR and ASCAT VOD in different ways. Additional analysis comparing CR to passive microwave-based VOD shows similar effects in deciduous broadleaf forests and high correlations over crop- and grasslands. Though the relationship between CR and VOD over deciduous forests is unclear, results suggest that CR is useful for monitoring vegetation dynamics over crop- and grassland and a potential path to high-resolution VOD.

TI  - A new IHS and wavelet based pansharpening algorithm for high spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing applications, pan-sharpening or image fusion focuses on improving the low spatial resolution (LSR) of multispectral (MS) images by injecting the details information selected from the panchromatic (PAN) images with high spatial resolution (HSR). This paper presents a new pansharpening alternative based on the combination of the well-known Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) method and multiscale analysis by using wavelets. The multiscale wavelet decomposition has been achieved by using the "a trous" wavelet transform (ATWT). In this novel approach, a new approximation of the weighting coefficients of the multispectral bands based on the combination of energy and correlation coefficients of the MS and PAN images is proposed. Therefore, the intensity element is extracted from the up-sampled MS images and the weighting coefficients of the intensity component are computed by using the average energy ratio and the correlation coefficients between the wavelet-based decomposed PAN image and the different MS bands in order to achieve more detail information. The detail information is then injected to the MS bands to obtain a fused image with high spectral and spatial information. The experimental results confirmed that a superior trade-off between spectral and spatial quality can be achieved by using the proposed approach. Moreover, compared to numerous classical and state-of-the-art pansharpening methods, the proposed scheme can inject more spatial information and guarantee more color preservation. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - The Comparison of Density-Based Clustering Approach among Different Machine Learning Models on Paddy Rice Image Classification of Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis, measurement, and computation of remote sensing images often require enhanced unsupervised/supervised classification approaches. The goal of this study is to have a better understanding of (a) the classification performance of multispectral image and hyperspectral image data; (b) the classification performance of unsupervised and supervised models; and (c) the classification performance of feature selection among different models. More specifically, the multispectral images and hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution are well accepted for improving land use and classification. Hence, this study used multispectral images (WorldView-2) and hyperspectral images (CASI-1500) and focused on the classifiers K-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and back-propagation neural network (BPN). Then the feature selection (principle component analysis, PCA) on four classifiers is studied. The results show that the image material of CASI-1500 classification accuracy is slightly better than that of WorldView-2. The overall classification of BPN is the best, the overall data has a kappa value of 0.89 and the overall accuracy is 97%. The DBSCAN presents a reality with good accuracy and the integrity of the thematic map. The DBSCAN can attain an accuracy of about 88% and save 95.1% of computational time.

AB  - Urban vegetation has an important role in ensuring the ecological security of cities. Rapid urbanization in China has radically changed the urban vegetation cover. Isolation of the contributions of human activities from observed vegetation can aid in understanding the effects of human activities on urban ecosystems. In this study, the Google Earth engine platform was employed, and the 1986-2017 archived Landsat data were used to derive the annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), i.e., the observed NDVI. This was combined with annual mean temperature and annual precipitation data; then, Theil-Sen median and Mann-Kendall trend analysis was used to study the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of NDVI. Residual analysis and relative effect analysis were used to analyze the contributions of human activities to vegetation cover changes in Harbin. The results of the study showed the following: (1) In 1986-2017, the NDVI of Harbin ranged from 0.36 to 0.67, and NDVI fluctuations are large. From a temporal scale, there were no clear trends in the observed annual mean NDVI values, but NDVI showed an increasing trend before 2000 and after 2010. (2) From a spatial perspective, the mean NDVI value of 32 years showed spatial variation, which was low in the center and high in the periphery, and the area of the vegetation improvement regions (38.04%) was greater than the area of the vegetation degradation regions (21.33%). (3) Regions in which human activities played a dominant role in vegetation degradation (relative effect of more than 50%) accounted for 67.14% of the entire degeneration regions, while regions in which human activities played a dominant role in vegetation improvement (relative effect of more than 50%) accounted for 84.64% of the entire improvement regions. Our study shows that over 32 years, an overall greening trend was observed in Harbin, but urban vegetation cover changes showed spatial variability, and human activities had a dominant effect on vegetation changes. Vegetation degradation was mainly caused by urban expansion. Greening projects in recent years such as tree planting, greening of the old city area, building of urban parks, and greening of city roads in Harbin can improve urban vegetation cover and are important measures for improving the urban ecological environment.

TI  - Image Spectral Resolution Enhancement for Mapping Native Plant Species in a Typical Area of the Three-River Headwaters Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale multispectral remote sensing data are often unavailable for some practical applications. Spectral resolution enhancement for large-scale multispectral remote sensing images by incorporating small-scale hyperspectral remote sensing images is an alternative way to generate remote sensing images with both large spatial range and high spectral resolution. This paper proposes an improved spectral resolution enhancement method (ISREM) using spectral matrix and weighting the spectral angle of the transformation matrix. ISREM is tested in a typical area of the Three-River Headwaters region (TRHR) to produce a synthetic hyperspectral image (HSI). Two existing spectral resolution enhancement methods, the color resolution improvement software package (CRISP) and spectral resolution enhancement method (SREM), are adopted to compare with ISREM. To further test the practicality of the synthetic HSIs generated by the ISREM, CRISP and SREM, they are used to estimate the coverage of native plant species (NPS) using support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) regressions. The experimental results are as follows. (1) For the Pearson correlation coefficient between the synthetic HSI and original image, ISREM yielded the largest value of 0.9582, followed by CRISP and SREM with values of 0.9480 and 0.9514. For spectral similarity, the HSI generated by the ISREM was the closest to the original reference HSI in the spectral curve. It also showed the best cumulative performance with the use of the three quality evaluation indexes. (2) The identification accuracies of native plant species were 93.51%, 90.91%, 89.61% and 89.61% using generated HSIs and original multispectral image (MSI) within a threshold of 20%, respectively. Compared with original MSI, the synthetic HSI showed better ability to identify NPS in the study area, which further illustrated the effectiveness of the ISREM. (3) The ISREM can reduce the strict requirement of pure pixels and maintain the quality of synthetic HSI by spectral angle weighting. Hence, the proposed ISREM outperforms the existing CRISP and SREM methods in image spectral resolution enhancement of multispectral remote sensing images.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability in long-term population exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and lung cancer mortality attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> across the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region over 2010-2016: A multistage approach
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, and is frequently influenced by fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Specifically, lung cancer mortality has been recognized as a major health burden associated with PM2.5. Therefore, this study developed a multistage approach 1) to first create dasymetric population data with moderate resolution (1 km) by using a random forest algorithm, brightness reflectance of nighttime light (NTL) images, a digital elevation model (DEM), and a MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and 2) to apply the improved population dataset with a MODIS-derived PM2.5 dataset to estimate the association between spatiotemporal variability of long-term population exposure to PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality attributable to PM2.5 across YRD during 2010-2016 for microscale planning. The created dasymetric population data derived from a coarse census unit (administrative unit) were fairly matched with census data at a fine spatial scale (street block), with R-2 and RMSE of 0.64 and 27,874.5 persons, respectively. Furthermore, a significant urban-rural difference of population exposure was found. Additionally, population exposure in Shanghai was 2.9-8 times higher than the other major cities (7-year average: 192,000 mu g.people/m(3).km(2)). More importantly, the relative risks of lung cancer mortality in high-risk areas were 28%-33% higher than in low-risk areas. There were 12,574-14,504 total lung cancer deaths attributable to PM2.5, and lung cancer deaths in each square kilometer of urban areas were 7-13 times higher than for rural areas. These results indicate that moderate-resolution information can help us understand the spatiotemporal variability of population exposure and related health risk in a high-density environment.

TI  - Mapping Freshwater Chlorophyll-a Concentrations at a Regional Scale Integrating Multi-Sensor Satellite Observations with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater over regional scales has been implemented through mapping chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations using multi-sensor satellite remote sensing data. Cloud-free satellite measurements and a sufficient number of matched-up ground samples are critical for constructing a predictive model for Chl-a concentration. This paper presents a methodological framework for automatically pairing surface reflectance values from multi-sensor satellite observations with ground water quality samples in time and space to form match-up points, using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. A support vector machine model was then trained using the match-up points, and the prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated and compared with traditional image processing results. This research demonstrates that the integration of multi-sensor satellite observations through Google Earth Engine enables accurate and fast Chl-a prediction at a large regional scale over multiple years. The challenges and limitations of using and calibrating multi-sensor satellite image data and current and potential solutions are discussed.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR measurements of deformation over discontinuous permafrost terrain, Northern Quebec, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) has been applied in permafrost environments to detect surface deformation caused by freeze-thaw processes in the active layer and underlying permafrost. The effectiveness of Sentinel-1 InSAR in monitoring ground surface deformation over continuous permafrost terrain above the treeline has been proven. The heterogeneous landscape and developed vegetation cover increase the difficulty of applying D-InSAR in sub-Arctic discontinuous permafrost terrain. The potential of Sentinel-1 InSAR in such an environment has not been fully explored. In this study, we explore the capabilities and limitations of applying Sentinel-1 time series data for monitoring surface deformation over discontinuous permafrost terrain. The interferometric coherence time series from September 2016 to April 2018 were analyzed over typical landscapes in discontinuous permafrost environments and their thaw subsidence curves are revealed by the small-baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR technique. The seasonal thaw subsidence in the summer of 2017 was in the range of 15-80 mm in the study area. The land cover types with thaw subsidence magnitudes from low to high are exposed land, peatland, lichen-low shrub, lichen-dominated and wetland low vegetation. The difference in displacement pattern between lichen-dominated and wetland-low vegetation-dominated permafrost terrains is especially clear at the end of the thawing stage, in September and October. The differences in thaw subsidence magnitude and pattern reveal the influence of the soil water content in the active layer and permafrost properties on the thaw subsidence patterns. We also compared the Sentinel-1 retrieved cumulative displacement with the X-band TerraSAR-X and L-band ALOS PALSAR results. The difference of retrieved deformation magnitude using the three sensors is amplified when shrubs are more developed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-1 time series with a 6-day or 12-day span work well over discontinuous permafrost terrain above the tree line (i.e., tundra, tundra wetlands and less developed shrub-tundra environments) during the thawed season, but the results and accuracy are not promising over developed shrub-tundra and, especially forest-tundra environments.

TI  - A New Algorithm for Sea Ice Melt Pond Fraction Estimation From High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt ponds occupy a large fraction of the Arctic sea ice surface during spring and summer. The fraction and distribution of melt ponds have considerable impacts on Arctic climate and ecosystem by reducing the albedo. There is an urgency to obtain improved accuracy and a wider coverage of melt pond fraction (MPF) data for studying these processes. MPF information has generally been acquired from optical imagery. Conventional MPF algorithms based on high-resolution optical sensors have treated melt ponds as features with constant reflectance; however, the spectral reflectance of ponds can vary greatly, even at a local scale. Here we use Sentinel-2 imagery to demonstrate those previous algorithms assuming fixed melt pond-reflectance greatly underestimate MPF. We propose a new algorithm ("LinearPolar") based on the polar coordinate transformation that treats melt ponds as variable-reflectance features and calculates MPF across the vector between melt pond and bare ice axes. The angular coordinate theta of the polar coordinate system, which is only associated with pond fraction rather than reflectance, is used to determinate MPF. By comparing the new algorithm and previous methods with IceBridge optical imagery data, across a variety of Sentinel-2 images with melt ponds at various stages of development, we show that the RMSE value of the LinearPolar algorithm is about 30% lower than for the previous algorithms. Moreover, based on a sensitivity test, the new algorithm is also less sensitive to the subjective threshold for melt pond reflectance than previous algorithms.Plain Language Summary Melt ponds are pools of open water that form on the sea ice surface in the Arctic in summer months. Sea ice covered by melt ponds absorbs more solar heat than solid ice which speeds up the rate of sea ice melt. To study this process, we need melt pond coverage data that are generally obtained from satellite observations. There are several methods to calculate the melt pond fraction from high-resolution optical satellite imagery but these methods assume that melt ponds have constant optical properties, which is not true. In this study, we show that these existing methods significantly underestimate melt pond fraction. To address this problem, we present a new method that treats melt ponds as features having variable optical properties. Images of sea ice from aircraft are used to assess the new algorithm and two previous methods, demonstrating that the new algorithm has higher accuracy and precision.Key PointsSentinel-2 and IceBridge imagery are used to show that algorithms assuming fixed melt pond-reflectance largely underestimate melt pond fraction A new algorithm based on the polar coordinate transformation that treats melt ponds as variable-reflectance has been developed The accuracy and precision of the new Sentinel-2 algorithm, assessed with IceBridge DMS imagery, are higher than previous algorithms

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Using Weakly Supervised Long Short-Term Memory Network with Time Series Sentinel Optical and SAR Images
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important staple food sources worldwide. Effective and cheap monitoring of rice planting areas is demanded by many developing countries. This study proposed a weakly supervised paddy rice mapping approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. First, standard temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter profiles for each land cover type were constructed on the basis of a small number of field samples. Weak samples were then labeled on the basis of their DTW distances to the standard temporal profiles. A time series feature set was then created that combined multi-spectral Sentinel-2 bands and Sentinel-1 SAR vertical received (VV) band. With different combinations of training and testing datasets, we trained a specifically designed LSTM classifier and validated the performance of weakly supervised learning. Experiments showed that weakly supervised learning outperformed supervised learning in paddy rice identification when field samples were insufficient. With only 10% of field samples, weakly supervised learning achieved better results in producer's accuracy (0.981 to 0.904) and user's accuracy (0.961 to 0.917) for paddy rice. Training with 50% of field samples also presented improvement with weakly supervised learning, although not as prominent. Finally, a paddy rice map was generated with the weakly supervised approach trained on field samples and DTW-labeled samples. The proposed data labeling approach based on DTW distance can reduce field sampling cost since it requires fewer field samples. Meanwhile, validation results indicated that the proposed LSTM classifier is suitable for paddy rice mapping where variance exists in planting and harvesting schedules.

TI  - Retrieval and Validation of AOD from Himawari-8 Data over Bohai Rim Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostationary satellite Himawari-8, possessing the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), which features 16 spectral bands from the visible to infrared range, is suitable for aerosol observations. In this study, a new algorithm is introduced to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land at a resolution of 2 km from the AHI level 1 data. Considering the anisotropic effects of complex surface structures over land, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model parameters product (MCD19A3) is used to calculate the surface reflectance for Himawari-8's view angle and band. In addition, daily BRDF model parameters are calculated in areas with dense vegetation, considering the rapid variation of surface reflectance caused by vegetation growth. Moreover, aerosol models are constructed based on long duration Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) single scattering albedo (SSA) values to stand for aerosol types in the retrieval algorithm. The new algorithm is applied to AHI images over Bohai Rim region from 2018 and is evaluated using the newest AERONET version 3 AOD measurements and the latest MODIS collection 6.1 AOD products. The AOD retrievals from the new algorithm show good agreement with the AERONET AOD measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12. In addition, the new algorithm increases AOD retrievals and retrieval accuracy compared to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) aerosol products. The algorithm shows stable performance during different seasons and times, which makes it possible for use in climate or diurnal aerosol variation studies.

TI  - Combined pattern matching and feature tracking for Bohai Sea ice drift detection using Gaofen-4 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is the main cause of winter marine disasters in the Bohai Sea, which is an important sea area in China. The sea ice in the Bohai Sea is easily deformed by strong water currents and rapid temperature changes. Consequently, low spatial and temporal resolution data cannot meet the needs of high-precision monitoring of the sea ice in the Bohai Sea. The geostationary satellite Gaofen-4 (GF-4) has the unique advantages of a high temporal resolution (20 s) and a high spatial resolution (50 m) and can be used to monitor sea ice drift in the Bohai Sea. We evaluate a new algorithm that combines the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique and the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method to obtain accurate sea ice drift information. The interclass separability method is used to determine the optimal band combination (OBC), and the results show that the OBC for distinguishing sea ice from sea water is B(2)x(B(1)x B-5)(-1). The proposed method improves noise immunity and calculation efficiency and considers the characteristics of ice blocks. The proposed algorithm can also obtain more correctly matched feature points than the NCC method and approximately 10 times more correct points than the SIFT technique. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the velocity obtained with the proposed algorithm is 0.1615 m s(-1)lower than those obtained with the SIFT and NCC methods, and the root mean square error of the velocity determination of the three algorithms is very small. The MAE of the ice movement direction obtained with the proposed algorithm is 0.605 degrees lower than those obtained with the SIFT and NCC methods, and the MAE of a second data set is 12.378 degrees better than that of the SIFT method. The motion of sea ice obtained by the proposed algorithm is close to the actual movement of the sea ice in the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Predicting soil organic carbon content in Spain by combining Landsat TM and ALOS PALSAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest carbon pool and a key property of ecosystems. Compared with traditional field surveys, remote sensing (RS) represents a more efficient approach to mapping SOC, especially in larger-scale areas. Hyperspectral imagery provides a great potential for SOC prediction, but predicting the SOC content at a regional scale for a given year remains a great challenge. Multispectral RS images (e.g., Landsat images) with middle spatial resolution can be used as an alternative to predict SOC amongst other images. However, multispectral images are commonly affected by cloud cover and lack information on the shallow soil surface and soil surface with vegetation. By contrast, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can capture shallow surface information, penetrate through vegetation and are not affected by cloud cover. In this study, a new approach was evaluated for the prediction of SOC content by integrating Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images. Mainland Spain (hereafter Spain) was used as the study site. Soil samples from the Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) European topsoil dataset in 2009 were utilized to fit a random forest (RF) model of the relationships between SOC content and several covariates in Spain. SOC prediction using only the Landsat TM image and only the ALOS PALSAR image was established as benchmarks to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. The results for Spain showed that the integrated approach holds the highest prediction accuracy, with R-2, RPD and RMSE of 0.59, 1.98 and 9.27 g kg(-1), respectively. The correlations between the SOC content and various covariates were investigated and discussed, and the derived indices presented high relationships with SOC. The proposed method can accurately map the SOC content covering a large area by combining spectral information on land cover from the Landsat TM and topsoil information from the ALOS PALSAR. Land covers and elevation are closely related to SOC prediction, where lands with high vegetation canopy density have high SOC content, and the SOC content in areas with slopes within 15 degrees is mainly concentrated between 3 and 26 g kg(-1).

TI  - A Scaling-Based Method for the Rapid Retrieval of FPAR From Fine-Resolution Satellite Data in the Remote-Sensing Trend-Surface Framework
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the fine-resolution fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) across broad spatial extents and long time periods requires efficient and applicable methods. The existing methods can hardly provide a balance between accuracy, simplicity, and transferability through space and time. Within the remote-sensing trend-surface conceptual framework, this article proposes a scaling-based method to efficiently retrieve FPAR from fine-resolution satellite data using coarse-resolution FPAR products as a reference. The method was particularly developed and applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FPAR product and Landsat imagery. First, necessary prior knowledge related to FPAR retrieval and scaling theories was used to explicitly linearize the complex relationship between MODIS FPAR and Landsat surface reflectance. Second, the explicit linear model for FPAR estimation was trained through one-pair image learning for each date to estimate FPAR from Landsat imagery in real time. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases were considered. The method was validated at ten selected worldwide sites from the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI) program and derived an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.133. A long time series of FPAR data set at the 30-m resolution was generated at the regional scale (approximately 2000 km(2)) for 13 years (20002012). The results were accurate (RMSE 0.072) and MODIS-consistent, which were significantly better than those of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) downscaling-based and regression tree methods. The scaling-based method provides accurate, MODIS-consistent and spatially consistent FPAR estimates in real time, is highly transferrable through space and time, and allows for future extension of FPAR estimates to the era of the Landsat series satellites.

TI  - The Microclimatic Effects of Ecological Restoration in Brownfield based on Remote Sensing Monitoring: The Case Studies of Landfills in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, brownfield is an important resource for land regeneration and restoration targeting to recover its ecosystem function. Landfills, as a type of brownfield distributed in the highly populated areas, occupy massive land resources. The ecological restoration of landfills becomes an engineering approach to achieve multiple effects of society, environment, and economy. This paper aims to monitor and assess the restoration microclimatic effects of landfills restoration in China with remote sensing data and techniques. We selected representative landfill restoration projects, including Nanhaizi Park in Beijing, Nanhu Park in Tangshan, and Tianziling Park in Hangzhou, as the study cases. Using the Landsat imagery, the scenes of the pre-restoration, mid-restoration, and post-restoration were retrieved, and the surface energy balance equation was applied to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (T-s), and evapotranspiration (ET), representing vegetation conditions and hydro-heat microclimate conditions. The study areas are divided into four subzones and extracted the calculated values for statistics and comparison. We defined an indicator of restoration intensity (RI) using the different subzones to the outer contour distance radius and restoration phases to evaluate the spatial-temporal restoration degrees. The spatial pattern dynamics was displayed in the urbanization context in the cases of Beijing and Tangshan. We examined and quantified the relations between RI and the key indicators, NDVI, T-s, and ET. The overall results revealed that with higher restoration intensity, NDVI and ET became higher, and T-s became lower. It suggested that the ecological restoration on the landfills brought better vegetation, cooling, and humidification effects for the microclimatic environment. Our research has the implications for monitoring and assessing the climatic effects of ecological restoration in the brownfield regeneration in a macroscopic and ecosystem perspective.

TI  - Comparison of indocyanine green fluorescence and methylene blue dye in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be successfully performed using methylene blue (MB); however, this method still has some drawbacks. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, as a selective method, has the potential for guiding SLNB. This study aimed to compare the clinical sensitivity and efficacy between ICG and MB in SLNB in breast cancer.Methods: A prospective study of 70 patients with biopsy-proven invasive breast cancer was conducted. Under the guidance of ICG and MB, administered by injection, SLNs were examined and removed. The detection rates, total number of SLNs detected, mean number of SLNs detected, and number of positive SLNs were compared between ICG and MB.Results: The SLN detection rate was 100% and 93% (65/70) for ICG and MB, respectively. More SLNs were detected in the ICG group (243) than in the MB group (169). The mean number of SLNs detected with ICG and MB was 3.5 +/- 1.73 and 2.4 +/- 1.49, respectively. Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between the number of SLNs detected using the two methods (t=6.648, P<0.05). Additionally, SLN metastasis was detected in 18 patients using ICG and 14 patients using MB; these patients immediately underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). No postoperative complications were reported.Conclusions: ICG demonstrated a higher detection rate and better accuracy, as well as a lower false negative rate, than MB in detecting SLNs in breast cancer. ICG has potential as an alternative tool that could be clinically applied to detect SLNs in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Mapping Soil Organic Carbon for Airborne and Simulated EnMAP Imagery Using the LUCAS Soil Database and a Local PLSR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil degradation is a major threat for European soils and therefore, the European Commission recommends intensifying research on soil monitoring to capture changes over time and space. Imaging spectroscopy is a promising technique to create spatially accurate topsoil maps based on hyperspectral remote sensing data. We tested the application of a local partial least squares regression (PLSR) to airborne HySpex and simulated satellite EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) data acquired in north-eastern Germany to quantify the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The approach consists of two steps: (i) the local PLSR uses the European LUCAS (land use/cover area frame statistical survey) Soil database to quantify the SOC content for soil samples from the study site in order to avoid the need for wet chemistry analyses, and subsequently (ii) a remote sensing model is calibrated based on the local PLSR SOC results and the corresponding image spectra. This two-step approach is compared to a traditional PLSR approach using measured SOC contents from local samples. The prediction accuracy is high for the laboratory model in the first step with R-2 = 0.86 and RPD = 2.77. The HySpex airborne prediction accuracy of the traditional approach is high and slightly superior to the two-step approach (traditional: R-2 = 0.78, RPD = 2.19; two-step: R-2 = 0.67, RPD = 1.79). Applying the two-step approach to simulated EnMAP imagery leads to a lower but still reasonable prediction accuracy (traditional: R-2 = 0.77, RPD = 2.15; two-step: R-2 = 0.48, RPD = 1.41). The two-step models of both sensors were applied to all bare soils of the respective images to produce SOC maps. This local PLSR approach, based on large scale soil spectral libraries, demonstrates an alternative to SOC measurements from wet chemistry of local soil samples. It could allow for repeated inexpensive SOC mapping based on satellite remote sensing data as long as spectral measurements of a few local samples are available for model calibration.

T2  - CIRCULATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The epidemiology and clinical features of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) in Japan have not been updated extensively.Methods and Results: This retrospective study used the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (JMHLW) medical support system database and associated health insurance data. The number of medical financial support recipients registered as TAO patients and estimated prevalence of TAO decreased from fiscal year (FY) 2000 (10,089 and 7.95 [95% confidence interval, CI: 7.79-8.10] per 100,000 population) to FY 2010 (7,147 and 5.58 [95% Cl: 5.45-5.71] per 100,000) and leveled off until 2014. The prevalence of TAO among patients with peripheral arterial occlusive diseases declined from 7.15% (95% Cl: 7.00-7.31) in FY 2008 to 6.12% (95% Cl: 5.98-6.26) in FY 2014. Clinicodemographic features were obtained from 89 new recipients in FY 2013 and 2014: 12 (13%) women, 36 (40%) aged >= 50 years, 26 (29%) had probable onset age >= 50 years, 7 (8%) were non-smokers, and 12 (13%) had arteriosclerosis-related comorbidities. The symptoms were similar regardless of registration age, smoking history, or sex. Although 40 (45%) had digit ulcers, only 12 (13%) fulfilled Shionoya's criteria. They rarely had infrapopliteal lesions combined with upper extremity involvement or phlebitis.Conclusions: The prevalence of TAO has decreased in Japan. In the current diagnosis of TAO, various clinical characteristics including late onset, arteriosclerotic factors, non-smoking, or mild symptoms should be considered.

TI  - Cloud detection for Landsat imagery by combining the random forest and superpixels extracted via energy-driven sampling segmentation approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary challenge in cloud detection is associated with highly mixed scenes that are filled with broken and thin clouds over inhomogeneous land. To tackle this challenge, we developed a new algorithm called the Random-Forest-based cloud mask (RFmask), which can improve the accuracy of cloud identification from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) images. For the development and validation of the algorithm, we first chose the stratified sampling method to pre-select cloudy and clear-sky pixels to form a prior-pixel database according to the land use cover around the world. Next, we select typical spectral channels and calculate spectral indices based on the spectral reflection characteristics of different land cover types using the top-of-atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature. These are then used as inputs to the RF model for training and establishing a preliminary cloud detection model. Finally, the Super-pixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling (SEEDS) segmentation approach is applied to re-process the preliminary classification results in order to obtain the final cloud detection results. The RFmask detection results are evaluated against the globally distributed United States Geological Survey (USGS) cloud-cover assessment validation products. The average overall accuracy for RFmask cloud detection reaches 93.8% (Kappa coefficient = 0.77) with an omission error of 12.0% and a commission error of 7.4%. The RFmask algorithm is able to identify broken and thin clouds over both dark and bright surfaces. The new model generally outperforms other methods that are compared here, especially over these challenging scenes. The RFmask algorithm is not only accurate but also computationally efficient. It is potentially useful for a variety of applications in using Landsat data, especially for monitoring land cover and land-use changes.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of physical-biogeochemical processes and intrinsic correlations in the semi-enclosed South Yellow Sea
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the spatiotemporal variability of biogeochemical processes and ecological responses under multiple physical controls in shelf seas is of great importance for obtaining an in-depth understanding of marine ecosystem. Based on a compiled data set of historical observations and remote sensing data, the spatiotemporal variability and heterogeneity of physical-biogeochemical processes in the semi-enclosed South Yellow Sea (SYS) are investigated, and the intrinsic connectivity among different subregions and the associated mechanisms are examined. The results show that the seasonal alternation between southward transport in cold seasons and upwelling-induced vertical delivery in warm seasons is the primary physical control of the biogeochemical processes and primary production off Shidao and in the area adjacent to the Haizhou Bay. The northeastward expansion of coastal waters in the Subei Shoal constitutes an important physical driver for the offshore transport of Ulva prolifera in summer. Stratification significantly affects the biogeochemical processes in the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM)-dominated area during warm seasons, and nutrients can accumulate in bottom waters from spring to autumn, making the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM) be an important nutrient pool. Upwelling around the YSCWM boundary in the stratified season leads to consistency among the high chlorophyll a (Chl a) area, high primary productivity region and low-temperature upwelling zone. During cold seasons, the interactions of the southward cold waters in the western nearshore area and the northward warm waters in the central region lead to an "S"-shaped front in the SYS. In summer, upwelling can extract nutrients from the YSCWM; thus, the biogeochemical-ecological processes inside the cold-water mass and in the frontal zone are well connected via upwelling, and three typical physical-biogeochemical coupling regions are generated, namely, the Shidao coast, the area beyond the Haizhou Bay and the area off the Subei Shoal. This work refines and integrates studies on regional oceanography in the SYS and provides a comprehensive and systematic framework of physical-biogeochemical-ecological processes.

TI  - A Relative Radiation Normalization Method of ISS Nighttime Light Images Based on Pseudo Invariant Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Space Station (ISS) offers a unique view from space that provides nighttime light (NTL) images of many parts of the globe. Compared with other NTL remote sensing data, ISS NTL multispectral images taken by astronauts with commercial digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras have the characteristics of free access, high spatial resolution, abundant data and no light saturation, so it plays a unique advantage in the research of small-scale urban planning, optimization of lighting resource allocation and blue light pollution. In order to improve the radiation consistency of ISS NTL images, a relative radiation normalization method of ISS NTL images is proposed in this paper. Pseudo invariant features (PIF) were identified in the cloud-free Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) time series NTL remote sensing annual composite product, and then they were used to derive the relative radiation normalization model of ISS NTL images. The results show that the radiation brightness of ISS NTL images in different regions is normalized to the same gray level with that of DMSP/OLS NTL remote sensing images in the same year, which improves the radiation brightness comparability between different regions of ISS NTL images. This method is universally applicable to all ISS NTL images, which is beneficial to the NTL comparability of ISS NTL image in the regional horizontal and temporal vertical.

TI  - Temperature Vegetation Precipitation Dryness Index (TVPDI)-based dryness-wetness monitoring in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) is a direct indicator of dryness of the land surface, and the amount of precipitation (P), vegetation status, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are directly related to SM; thus, these factors indirectly characterize the dryness of the land surface. However, there are limitations and shortcomings of using a single factor to assess dryness because of the interactions among factors. A method that can combine the advantages of the three factors is needed to better monitor dryness. In this study, a new Remote Sensing (RS) dryness index, called the Temperature Vegetation Precipitation Dryness Index (TVPDI), was defined and developed using the Euclidean distance method and three-dimensional (3D) P-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-LST.The reasonableness of this index was tested and verified using SM data, three variables (P, NDVI, and LST), other recognized dryness indices, crop yield per unit area and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). In addition, the reliability of the TVPDI results was analyzed at different spatial scales and using different data sources. The results demonstrated that the TVPDI was highly correlated with SM (R > 0.64, p < .01) and exhibited better performance than the P, NDVI, and LST results. The time series of the TVPDI and other dryness indices exhibited spatially good consistency. The TVPDI was temporally well-matched to the crop yield per unit area and NPP in most regions of China, and performed better than other dryness indices. Furthermore, in the four sample regions, the TVPDIMODIS results closely matched the TVPDILandsat and Landsat image results, indicating that the TVPDI is a reliable and robust index for dryness monitoring to some extent. Moreover, the application of the TVPDI for dryness-wetness monitoring in China indicated significant spatiotemporal differences in the dryness-wetness status at both monthly and annual scales. The distribution of dryness in China exhibited obvious differences in different agricultural regions. In conclusion, the TVPDI is an RS dryness index that can be applied to dryness assessments.

TI  - Spatial shifts in productivity of the coastal ocean over the past two decades induced by migration of the Pacific Anticyclone and Bakun's effect in the Humboldt Upwelling Ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification and poleward expansion of upwelling-favourable winds have been predicted as a response to anthropogenic global climate change and have recently been documented in most Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems of the world. To identify how these processes are impacting nearshore oceanographic habitats and, especially, long-term trends of primary productivity in the Humboldt Upwelling Ecosystem (HUE), we analysed time series of sea level pressure, wind stress, sea surface and atmospheric surface temperatures, and Chlorophylla, as a proxy for primary productivity, along 26 degrees-36.degrees S. Major artisanal and industrial fisheries are supported by phytoplankton productivity in this region and, therefore, identification of long-term trends and their spatial variability is critical for our ability to adapt to and to mitigate the effects of global climate change. We show that climate-induced trends in primary productivity are highly heterogeneous across the region. On the one hand, the well-documented poleward migration of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) has led to decreased spring upwelling winds in the region between ca. 30 degrees and 34 degrees S, and to their intensification to the south. Decreased winds have produced slight increases in sea surface temperature and a pronounced and meridionally extensive decrease in surface Chlorophyll-a in this region of central Chile. To the north of 30 degrees S, significant increases in upwelling winds, decreased SST, and enhanced chlorophyll-a concentration are observed in the nearshore. We show that this increase in upwelling-driven coastal productivity is probably produced by the increased land-sea pressure gradients (Bakun's effect) that have occurred over the past two decades north of 30 degrees S. Thus, climate drivers along the HUE are inducing contrasting trends in oceanographic conditions and primary productivity, which can have far-reaching consequences for coastal pelagic and benthic ecosystems and lead to geographic displacements of the major fisheries.

TI  - Green growth? On the relation between population density, land use and vegetation cover fractions in a city using a 30-years Landsat time series
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Both compact and dispersed green cities are considered sustainable urban forms, yet some developments accompanied with these planning paradigms seem problematic in times of urban growth. A compact city might lose urban green spaces due to infill and a dispersed-green city might lose green in its outskirts through suburbanisation. To study these storylines, we introduce an operationalised concept of contrasting changes in population density (shrinkage or growth) with vegetation density (sealing or greening) over time. These trends are ascribed to different land use classes and single urban development projects, to quantify threads and pathways for urban green in a densifying city. We mapped the development in vegetation density over 30 years as subpixel fractions based on a Landsat remote sensing time series (for 2015: MAE 0.12). The case study city Berlin, Germany, developed into a city that is both gaining in vegetation-greening-and population-growing-in recent years but featured highly diverse trends for both compact and green city districts before that. Pathways to achieve a greening-growing scenario in a compact city include green roofs, brownfield and industrial revitalisation, and bioswales in predominantly green city districts. A threat for compact cities pose infill developments without greening measures. A threat for dispersed-green cities is microsealing in private residential gardens-gravel gardens-or car parking infrastructure. We conclude that neither a compact nor a dispersed-green city form concept logically leads to a development towards more environmental quality-here vegetation density-in times of densification but rather context specific urban planning.

TI  - Clinical application of axillary reverse mapping in patients with breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique, identify and preserve arm nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), was developed to prevent breast-cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) remains controversial.Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline Ovid, Pubmed, Web of Science and the Cochrane CENTRAL databases was conducted from the inception till January 2020. The key word including "breast cancer", "axillary reverse mapping", and "lymphedema". Stata 15.1 software was used for the meta-analysis.Results: As a result, twenty-nine related studies involving 4954 patients met our inclusion criteria. The pooled overall estimate lymphedema incidence was 7% (95% CI 4%-11%, I-2 = 90.35%, P < 0.05), with SLNB showed a relatively lower pooled incidence of lymphedema (2%, 95% CI 1%-3%), I-2 = 26.06%, P = 0.23) than that of ALND (14%, 95% CI 5%-26%, I-2 = 93.28%, P < 0.05) or SLNB and ALND combined (11%, 95% CI 1%-30%). The ARM preservation during ALND procedure could significantly reduce upper extremity lymphedema in contrast with ARM resection (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.20-0.36, I-2 = 31%, P = 0.161). Intriguingly, the result favored ALND-ARM over standard-ALND in preventing lymphedema occurrence (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.31, I-2 = 43%, P = 0.153). The risk of metastases in the ARM-nodes was not significantly lower in the patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as compared to those without neoadjuvant treatment (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.74-1.94, I-2 = 49.4%, P = 0.095).Conclusions: ARM was found to significantly reduce the incidence of BCRL. The selection of patients for this procedure should be based on their axillary nodal status. Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has no significant impact on the ARM lymph node metastasis rate.

TI  - Spatial variability in Ontario Riesling vineyards. II. Berry composition
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variability of berry composition was studied over a 3-yr period in 10 Riesling vineyards in the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario. Vineyards were delineated using global positioning systems (GPS), and 75-80 sentinel vines were georeferenced within a sampling grid for data collection. During 2005-2007, vine water status measurements [leaf water potential (psi)] were collected biweekly from a subset of these sentinel vines. Data were collected on soil texture and composition, soil water content (SWC; %), leaf psi, and fruit composition. These variables were mapped using GIS software, and relationships between them were elucidated. Temporal stability in spatial patterns of soil texture and composition, SWC, leaf psi, soluble solids (Brix), titratable acidity, and monoterpenes were examined. Spatial trends in leaf psi and (or) SWC showed widespread evidence of temporal stability. Fruit composition variables were not as stable over a 3-yr period. Spatial trends in Brix were temporally stable in seven vineyards, free volatile terpenes were temporally stable in three vineyards, and potentially volatile terpenes were temporally stable in two vineyards. Consistent leaf psi zones were identified, and these were temporally stable despite different climatic conditions. Furthermore, some soil variables, and particularly vine water status, may contribute significantly to the terroir effect through their effects on vine size and fruit composition. For some vineyards, many viticulture and fruit composition variables were also temporally stable. There was evidence of strong spatial relationships between leaf psi and fruit composition, suggesting a strong relationship between berry composition and vine water status.

TI  - Definitions of "rural" and "urban" and understandings of economic transformation: Evidence from Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing effective policies for economic development often entails categorizing populations by their rural or urban status. Yet there exists no universal definition of what constitutes an "urban" area, and countries alternately apply criteria related to settlement size, population density, or economic advancement. In this study, we explore the implications of applying different urban definitions, focusing on Tanzania for illustrative purposes. Toward this end, we refer to nationally representative household survey data from Tanzania, collected in 2008 and 2014, and categorize households as urban or rural using seven distinct definitions. These are based on official administrative categorizations, population densities, daytime and nighttime satellite imagery, local economic characteristics, and subjective assessments of Google Earth images. These definitions are then applied in some common analyses of demographic and economic change. We find that these urban definitions produce different levels of urbanization. Thus, Tanzania's urban population share based on administrative designations was 28% in 2014, though this varies from 12% to 39% with alternative urban definitions. Some indicators of economic development, such as the level of rural poverty or the rate of rural electrification, also shift markedly when measured with different urban definitions. The periodic (official) recategorization of places as rural or urban, as occurs with the decennial census, results in a slower rate of rural poverty decline than would be measured with time-constant boundaries delimiting rural Tanzania. Because the outcomes of analysis are sensitive to the urban definitions used, policy makers should give attention to the definitions that underpin any statistics used in their decision making.

TI  - Soil Respiration Response to Rainfall Modulated by Plant Phenology in a Montane Meadow, East River, Colorado, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration is a primary component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, predicting the response of soil respiration to climate change remains a challenge due to the complex interactions between environmental drivers, especially plant phenology, temperature, and soil moisture. In this study, we use a 1-D diffusion-reaction model to calculate depth-resolved CO2 production rates from soil CO2 concentrations and surface efflux observations in a subalpine meadow in the East River watershed, CO. Modeled rates are compared to in situ soil temperature and moisture conditions and MODIS satellite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) representing plant phenology across three hydrologically distinct growing seasons from 2016-2018. While soil respiration correlated with temperature on diel timescales (p < 0.05), seasonal variability was dominated by soil moisture and plant phenology (p < 0.05). We observed significant respiration increases in response to precipitation events; however, magnitude and duration were significantly higher in 2017 than 2016 despite similar wetting characteristics. Based on MODIS EVI, we suggest that the respiration response to rainfall is controlled by plant phenology, which in turn reflects the capacity of plants to respond to precipitation via increased photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration, behavior that is not captured in typical soil respiration pulse models. Projected changes in montane climate such as earlier snowmelt and prolonged fore-summer drought may decrease soil respiration fluxes by decreasing the overlap between peak productivity and the summer monsoon. Finally, we observed significant late season CO2 fluxes from the deep subsoil (>165 cm) that support growing evidence for the importance of subsoil processes in driving integrated respiration fluxes.

TI  - Variability of Diurnal Sea Surface Temperature during Short Term and High SST Event in the Western Equatorial Pacific as Revealed by Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface diurnal warming is an important process in the climate system, driving exchanges of water vapor and heat between the ocean and the atmosphere. The occurrence of the hot event (HE) is associated with the high diurnal sea surface temperature amplitude (delta SST), which is defined as the difference between daily maximum and minimum sea surface temperature (SST). However, previous studies still show some inconsistency for the area of HE occurrence and high delta SST. The present study produces global delta SST data based on the SST, sea surface wind data derived from microwave radiometers, and solar radiation data obtained from visible/infrared radiometers. The value of delta SSTs are estimated and validated over tropical oceans and then used for investigating HE in the western equatorial Pacific. A three-way error analysis was conducted using in situ mooring buoy arrays and geostationary SST measurements by the Himawari-8 and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). The standard deviation error of daily and 10-day validation is around 0.3 degrees C and 0.14-0.19 degrees C, respectively. Our case study in the western Pacific (from 110 degrees E to 150 degrees W) shows that the area of HE occurrence coincided well with the area of high delta SST. Climatological analysis shows that the collocated area between high occurrence rate of HE and high delta SST, which coincides with the western Pacific warm pool region in all seasons. Thus, this study provides more persuasive evidence of the relation between HE occurrence and high delta SST.

TI  - Long-Term Dropout of Relativistic Electrons in the Outer Radiation Belt During Two Sequential Geomagnetic Storms
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 31 January 2016, the flux of >2 MeV electrons observed by Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-13 dropped to the background level during a minor storm main phase (-48 nT). Then, a second storm (-53 nT) occurred on 2 February; during the 3 days after its main phase, the flux remained at background level. Using data from various instruments on the GOES, Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP), Meteor-M2, and Fengyun-series spacecraft, we study this long-term dropout of MeV electrons during two sequential storms of similar magnitude under lightly disturbed solar wind conditions. Observations from low-altitude satellites show that the fluxes decreased first at higher L-shells and then gradually propagated inward. Moreover, the fluxes were almost completely lost and dropped to the background level at L > 5, while the fluxes at 4 < L < 5 were partly lost, as observed by RBSP and low-altitude satellites. Finally, observations show that on 5 February, only the fluxes at L > 5.5 recovered, while the fluxes at 4 < L < 5 did not return to the prestorm levels. These observations indicate that the loss and recovery processes developed first at higher L-shells. Phase space density (PSD) analysis shows that radial outward diffusion was the main reason for the dropout at higher L-shells. Regarding electron enhancement, stronger inward diffusion was accompanied by ultra-low-frequency (ULF) wave activities at higher L-shells, and chorus waves observed at outer L-shells provided conditions for relativistic electron flux recovery to the prestorm levels.

TI  - Ecological environment assessment for Greater Mekong Subregion based on Pressure-State-Response framework by remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The environment project in the greater Mekong sub-region was the largest multi -field environmental coopera-tion launched by six countries (China, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia) in 2006, since the cooperation mechanism was established by Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1992. How to establish the in-dicators to assess the achievements of the biological corridor construction and the status of ecological en-vironment quantitatively is one of the prerequisites for the future project ongoing phase. The popular Pressure -State-Response (PSR) framework was employed in this study to assess the natural and human pressure, the healthy state of regional natural environment, and the subsequent response of ecosystem dynamic change in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Instead of using surveying based data as driving parameters, large amount of driving factors were retrieved from multi-source remote sensing data from 2000 to 2017, which provides access to larger updated and real-time databases, more tangible data allowing more objective goal management, and better spatially covered. The driving factors for pressure analysis included digital elevation, land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, light index, road network map, land cover dynamic change and land use degree, which were derived directly and indirectly from remote sensing. The indicators for state evaluation were composed of ve-getation index, leaf area index, and fractional vegetation cover from remote sensing directly. The comprehensive response index was mainly determined by the pressure and state indicators. Through the analysis based on an overlay technique, it showed that the ecological environment deteriorated firstly from 2000 to 2010 and then started to improve from 2010 to 2017. The proofs indicated that the natural forest and wetland ecosystems were improved and the farmland area was decreased between 2000 and 2017. This study explored effective indicators from remote sensing for the ecological and environmental assessment, which can provide a strong decision -making basis for promoting the sustainable development of the ecological environment in the greater Mekong subregion, as well as the technological support for the construction of the biodiversity corridor.

TI  - Two decades of settlement of Hong Kong International Airport measured with multi-temporal InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) was constructed on a platform mainly reclaimed from the sea. The platform has experienced some significant settlement since its operation in 1998 due mainly to consolidation of the materials used in the land reclamation. Although some studies have been carried out to measure the settlement with techniques such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), the past studies have each only covered some limited time periods. Therefore, a complete history of settlement since the operation of the Airport has never been available to aid the understanding of the spatiotemporal behavior of the land settlement. We attempt for the first time to make full use of most of the available SAR data from multiple SAR sensors (ERS-2, ENVISAT ASAR, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), and Sentinel-1A) to generate a settlement time series of the HKIA over 1998-2018 with an improved multi-temporal InSAR technique. In order to fill the time gaps between the different SAR datasets, a settlement model is developed based on the InSAR measurements. The results reveal both the spatial and temporal variations of the land settlement. They also show for the first time that the accumulative settlement reaches up to 40 cm over the past two decades. The settlement is largely associated with the material types used in the landfill works and the underlying alluvial sediments as some earlier research has indicated, and the stages of the reclamation works. The results are validated through cross-validation between the datasets and with leveling and GPS measurements on the Airport platform.

TI  - Self-Attentive Generative Adversarial Network for Cloud Detection in High Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an important step in the processing of remote sensing images. Most methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cloud detection require pixel-level labels, which are time-consuming and expensive to annotate. To overcome this challenge, this letter proposes a novel semisupervised algorithm for cloud detection by training a self-attentive generative adversarial network (SAGAN) to extract the feature difference between cloud images and cloud-free images. Our main idea is to introduce visual attention into the process of generating "real" cloud-free images. The training of SAGAN is based on three guiding principles: expansion of attention maps of cloud regions which will be replaced with translated cloud-free images, reduction of attention maps to coincide with cloud boundaries, and optimization of a self-attentive network to handle the extreme cases. The inputs for SAGAN training are the images and image-level labels, which are easier, cheaper, and more time-saving than the existing methods based on CNN. To test the performance of SAGAN, experiments are conducted on the Sentinel-2A Level 1C image data. The results show that the proposed method achieves very promising results with only the image-level labels of training samples.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Data to Study the Coupling Relationship between Urbanization and Eco-Environment Change: A Case Study in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Promoting the coordinated development of urbanization and eco-environment is essential for the development of urban agglomerations. As an emerging economic growth pole in China, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, relevant studies in this area have been largely constrained by the incomparability of statistical data between the inland part of the GBA and the two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macao) of the GBA. This study used nighttime light data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to evaluate the level of urbanization and eco-environment in the GBA, respectively. Then we adopted the gravity center model to analyze the overall coupling situation between urbanization and eco-environment change. We also adopted a coordination index to determine the spatial differentiation characteristics of this coupling in the GBA from 2000 to 2018. The results show that (1) the spatial pattern of urbanization and eco-environment both show an approximately circular structure, and the change rates of these two variables show significant spatiotemporal differentiation; (2) on the whole, urban development and eco-environment construction became more coupled in the GBA during 2000-2018, as indicated by the continuously decreasing distance between the gravity centers of urbanization and eco-environment; and (3) as for the spatial differentiation characteristic of this coupling, the GBA was generally dominated by slightly uncoupled units, while the spatial distribution of different coupling types transformed from a circular structure to a relatively random form.

TI  - Enhanced Intensity Analysis to Quantify Categorical Change and to Identify Suspicious Land Transitions: A Case Study of Nanchang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional methods to analyze a transition matrix do not offer in-depth signals concerning land changes. The land change community needs an effective approach to visualize both the size and intensity of land transitions while considering possible map errors. We propose a framework that integrates error analysis, intensity analysis, and difference components, and then uses the framework to analyze land change in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi province, China. We used remotely sensed data for six categories at four time points: 1989, 2000, 2008, and 2016. We had a confusion matrix for only 2016, which estimated that the map of 2016 had a 12% error, while the temporal difference during 2008-2016 was 22% of the spatial extent. Our tools revealed suspected errors at other years by analyzing the patterns of temporal difference. For example, the largest component of temporal difference was exchange, which could indicate map errors. Our framework identified categories that gained during one time interval then lost during the subsequent time interval, which raised the suspicion of map error. This proposed framework facilitated visualization of the size and intensity of land transitions while illustrating possible map errors that the profession routinely ignores.

TI  - Analysis of land cover evolution within the built-up areas of provincial capital cities in northeastern China based on nighttime light data and Landsat data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastering the evolution of urban land cover is important for urban management and planning. In this paper, a method for analyzing land cover evolution within urban built-up areas based on nighttime light data and Landsat data is proposed. The method solves the problem of inaccurate descriptions of urban built-up area boundaries from the use of single-source diurnal or nocturnal remote sensing data and was able to achieve an effective analysis of land cover evolution within built-up areas. Four main procedures are involved: (1) The neighborhood extremum method and maximum likelihood method are used to extract nighttime light data and the urban built-up area boundaries from the Landsat data, respectively; (2) multisource urban boundaries are obtained using boundary pixel fusion of the nighttime light data and Landsat urban built-up area boundaries; (3) the maximum likelihood method is used to classify Landsat data within multisource urban boundaries into land cover classes, such as impervious surface, vegetation and water, and to calculate landscape indexes, such as overall landscape trends, degree of fragmentation and degree of aggregation; (4) the changes in the multisource urban boundaries and landscape indexes were obtained using the abovementioned methods, which were supported by multitemporal nighttime light data and Landsat data, to model the urban land cover evolution. Using the cities of Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin in northeastern China as experimental areas, the multitemporal landscape index showed that the integration and aggregation of land cover in the urban areas had an increasing trend, the natural environment of Shenyang and Harbin was improving, while Changchun laid more emphasis on the construction of artificial facilities. At the same time, the method proposed in this paper to extract built-up areas from multi-source city data showed that the user accuracy, production accuracy, overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are at least 3%, 1%, 1% and 0.04 higher than the single-source data method.

AB  - Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have successfully operated since their launches in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and generated various data products to support the Earth remote sensing disciplines and users worldwide for their research activities and applications, including studies of the Earth system, and its changes over time and geographic regions. The MODIS data have also significantly contributed to the continuity of multi-decadal satellite data records and led to major advances in the Earth remote sensing field. The long-term data records from MODIS observations have been and will continue to be extended by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments, currently operated aboard the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. The data quality of satellite instruments strongly depends on their calibration accuracy and stability. In order to help scientists and users gain a better understanding of MODIS and VIIRS data quality, this paper provides an overview of their on-orbit calibration methodologies, approaches, and results derived from instrument on-board calibrators and lunar observations, as well as select Earth view targets. What is also discussed is the calibration consistency between MODIS and VIIRS and its potential impact on producing multi-sensor long-term data records. As illustrated, the overall performance of both MODIS and VIIRS continues to meet their design requirements.

TI  - Comparisons of Performance Using Data Assimilation and Data Fusion Approaches in Acquiring Precipitable Water Vapor: A Case Study of a Western United States of America Area
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - There are two main types of methods available to obtain precipitable water vapor (PWV) with high accuracy. One is to assimilate observations into a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, for example, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to improve the accuracy of meteorological parameters, and then obtain the PWV with improved accuracy. The other is the direct fusion of multi-source PWV products. Regarding the two approaches, we conduct a comparison experiment on the West Coast of the United States of America with the data from May 2018, in which the WRF data assimilation (DA) system is used to assimilate the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) PWV, while the method by Zhang et al. to fuse the GNSS PWV, ERA5 PWV and MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) PWV. As a result, four groups of PWV products are generated: the assimilated GNSS PWV, the unassimilated GNSS PWV, PWV from the fusion of the GNSS PWV and ECWMF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA5 (ECWMF Reanalysis 5) PWV, and PWV from the fusion of the GNSS PWV, ERA5 PWV and MODIS PWV. Experiments show that the data assimilation based on the WRF model (WRFDA) and adopted fusion method can generate PWV products with similar accuracy (1.47 mm vs. 1.52 mm). Assimilating the GNSS PWV into the WRF model slightly improves the accuracy of the inverted PWV by 0.18 mm. The fusion of the MODIS PWV, GNSS PWV and ERA5 PWV results in a higher accuracy than the fusion of GNSS PWV and ERA5 PWV by a margin of 0.35 mm. In addition, the inland canyon topography appears to have an influence on the inversion accuracy of both the methods.

TI  - First study of Sentinel-3 SLSTR active fire detection and FRP retrieval: Night-time algorithm enhancements and global intercomparison to MODIS and VIIRS AF products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) now operates concurrently onboard the European Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites. Its observations are expected ultimately to become the main global source of active fire (AF) detections and fire radiative power (FRP) retrievals for the mid-morning and evening low earth orbit timeslots - data currently supplied by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra. Here we report for the first-time the significant adjustments made to the pre-launch Sentinel-3 AF detection and fire characterisation algorithm required to optimize its performance with real SLSTR data collected from the Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites. SLSTR possesses both an S7 'standard' and an F1 'fire' channel that operate in the same middle infrared (MIR) waveband, but which use different detectors with differing dynamic ranges and which are located at different focal plane locations. When S7 provides saturated observations, for example over higher FRP active fire pixels, F1 must be used to provide a reliable MIR spectral measurement. However, the two channels differing data characteristics (slightly different size, shape and spatial location of the matching pixels) means that swapping between their measurements is non-trivial. The main algorithm enhancement has therefore been the addition of a dedicated active fire pixel clustering component, required to cluster the detected AF pixels into individual fires as a solution to this issue. Focusing on night-time data due to the added complexity of daytime implementation, we compare AF information derived with this updated SLSTR algorithm to that from near-simultaneous MODIS Terra, and we find that SLSTR has a lower minimum FRP detection limit which enables more lower FRP active fire pixels to be identified than is the case with MODIS. When both sensors detect the same fire cluster at the same time, SLSTR typically measures a slightly higher FRP due to it being able to detect more of the low FRP AF pixels lying at the cluster edge (the OLS linear best fit between matched SLSTR and MODIS per-fire FRP matchups has a slope of 1.08). At the regional scale, SLSTR detects 90% of the AF pixels that the matching MODIS data contains, but also identifies an additional 44% more AF pixels - the vast majority of which have FRP < 5 MW. Regional FRP totals derived from SLSTR appear slightly higher than those from MODIS because of this, and the OLS linear best fit between these regional FRP matchup datasets has a slope of 1.10. Global fire mapping at 1 degrees grid cell resolution for January 2019 shows very similar fire patterns and FRP totals from SLSTR onboard of Sentinel-3B and MODIS Terra, with SLSTR detecting seven times more AF pixels but very similar FRP totals. Case studies in 5 degrees grid cell areas show the same pattern, and longer-term comparisons like these will provide the data required to mesh MODIS and SLSTR data into a single compatible time-series for long-term trend analysis. The night-time SLSTR AF product based largely on this algorithm has been fully operational from March 2020 and is available from near real-time feeds. A non-time critical (NTC) version based on a similar processing chain will follow shortly after, with products available from the Sentinel-3 Data Hub.

TI  - Twelve-Year Dynamics and Rainfall Thresholds for Alternating Creep and Rapid Movement of the Hooskanaden Landslide From Integrating InSAR, Pixel Offset Tracking, and Borehole and Hydrological Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hooskanaden landslide is a large (similar to 600 m wide x 1,300 m long), deep (similar to 30 - 45 m) slide located in southwestern Oregon. Since 1958, it has had five moderate/major movements that catastrophically damaged the intersecting U.S. Highway 101, along with persistent slow wet-season movements and a long-term accelerating trend due to coastal erosion. Multiple remote sensing approaches, borehole measurements, and hydrological observations have been integrated to interpret the motion behaviors of the slide. Pixel offset tracking of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images was carried out to reconstruct the 3-D displacement field of the 2019 major event, and the results agree well with field measurements. A 12-year displacement history of the landslide from 2007 to 2019 has been retrieved by incorporating offsets from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) gradients and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing of ALOS and Sentinel-1 images. Comparisons with daily/hourly ground precipitation reveal that the motion dynamics are predominantly controlled by intensity and temporal pattern of rainfall. A new empirical threefold rainfall threshold was therefore proposed to forecast the dates for the moderate/major movements. This threshold relies upon antecedent water-year and previous 3-day and daily precipitation and was able to represent observed movement periods well. Adaptation of our threshold methodology could prove useful for other large, deep landslides for which temporal forecasting has long been generally intractable. The averaged characteristic hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity were estimated as 6.6 x 10(-6) m/s and 6.6 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, respectively, based on the time lags between rainfall pulses and slide accelerations. Hydrologic modeling using these parameters helps to explain the ability of the new rainfall threshold.

TI  - Radar Satellite Image Time Series Analysis for High-Resolution Mapping of Man-Made Forest Change in Chongming Eco-Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are important oxygen sources and carbon sinks. They provide a series of ecosystem services that are crucial to eco-island sustainability, such as the protection of soils, conservation of biodiversity, and development of the eco-tourism, etc. Interestingly, Chongming eco-island is located in the borderlands between fresh- and saltwater environments, where the Yangtze River meets the East China Sea. Most forests in Chongming island are therefore man-made and very vulnerable to the ecological environment mixing of freshwater streams and rivers with salty ocean tides, and are affected by climate and human activity. Estimating and monitoring forest change within an estuary is required for the sustainable management of forest resources and forest-based eco-tourism. Most optical satellites are unsuitable for continuous forest mapping due to cloud cover and their relatively low spatial and temporal resolution. Here, using Sentinel-1 satellite carrying an imaging C-band synthetic aperture radar, radar vegetation index was derived to detect the forest dynamics on the island. Furthermore we quantified forest area change in three well known and the most strictly protected and representative areas, namely Dongping National Forest Park, Dongtan National Wetland Park, and Xisha National Wetland Park, in the Chongming eco-island over the past five years at 10-metre resolution. We recorded the early and mid summers when the forest canopies grew to the peak in the study areas. The planted forest in Dongping National Forest Park grew an area of 7.38 hectares from 2015 to 2019, and disappeared from an area of almost 2.59 hectares in 2018. The man-made forest of Xisha National Wetland Park increased at an area of almost 20.19 hectares over the past five years. The forest in Dongtan National Wetland Park increased to an area of almost 2.12 hectares in the period of 2015-2017 and 2018-2019. However, from 2017 to 2018, the area of planted forests in Dongtan National Wetland Park decreased by 1.35 hectares. This study shows man-made forest change can be measured and that evidence can be collected to show how the forest is altered by human activities, and informs forest management decision-making for Chongming eco-island.

TI  - Tree species classification using UAS-based digital aerial photogrammetry point clouds and multispectral imageries in subtropical natural forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species composition of forest stand is an important indicator of forest inventory attributes for assessing ecosystem health, understanding successional processes, and digitally displaying forest biodiversity. In this study, we acquired high spatial resolution multispectral and RGB imagery over a subtropical natural forest in southwest China using a fixed-wing UAV system. Digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) technique was used to generate multi-spectral and RGB derived point clouds, upon which individual tree crown (ITC) delineation algorithms and a machine learning classifier were used to identify dominant tree species. To do so, the structure-from-motion method was used to generate RGB imagery-based DAP point clouds. Then, three ITC delineation algorithms (i.e., point cloud segmentation (PCS), image-based multiresolution segmentation (IMRS), and advanced multiresolution segmentation (AMRS)) were used and assessed for ITC detection. Finally, tree-level metrics (i.e., multispectral, texture and point cloud metrics) were used as metrics in the random forest classifier used to classify eight dominant tree species. Results indicated that the accuracy of the AMRS ITC segmentation was highest (F-1-score = 82.5 %), followed by the segmentation using PCS (F-1-score = 79.6 %), the IMRS exhibited the lowest accuracy (F-1-score = 78.6 %); forest types classification (coniferous and deciduous) had a higher accuracy than the classification of all eight tree species, and the combination of spectral, texture and structural metrics had the highest classification accuracy (overall accuracy = 80.20 %). In the classification of both eight tree species and two forest types, the classification accuracies were lowest when only using spectral metrics, indicated that the texture metrics and point cloud structural metrics had a positive impact on the classification (the overall accuracy and kappa accuracy increased by 1.49-4.46 % and 2.86-6.84 %, respectively).

TI  - Sentinel nubbin: A potential pitfall in the management of undescended testis secondary to epididymo-testicular nonunion
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionEpididymal anomalies are common in boys with undescended testis. Epididymo-testicular non-union with a nubbin in the scrotum is a rare anomaly and may be confusing during management of cryptorchidism. The non-fused epididymis and vas deferens which are descended to the scrotum, may be regarded as nubbin tissue secondary to testicular atrophy and proximal testis may be overlooked.ObjectiveTo evaluate a relatively rare anomaly of epididymotesticular non-union in which vas deferens and epididymis are descended to the scrotum resembling a nubbin tissue, while a separate testis remains in a proximal peritoneal fold (hernia or processus vaginalis)which could potentially be missed during the management of patients with undescended testis.Study designThe charts of the fourteen patients with epididymotesticular non-union and a scrotal nubbin are retrospectively evaluated.ResultsMedian age of the patiens was 1.5 years (0.5-12), 11 were left and 3 were right. No connection could be demonstrated between the testis and vasoepididymal unit in any of the patients. Orchidopexy was performed in 13 patients while orchidectomy inl patient. The scrotal nubbin tissue is excised in 4 patients and histological examination revealed sections of vas deferens and epididymis. One of the patients underwent inguinal exploration and orchidectomy for assumed testicular atrophy else-where but histological examination revealed vas deferens and epididymis without any sign suggesting an atrophic testis. An intrabdominal testis was found incidentally in this patient and he underwent 2 additional procedures for orchidopexy.DiscussionAlthough epididymo-testicular anomalies are common in boys with undescended testis, nonunion is the rarest type of this anomaly. Similar cases are reported in the literature as simple fusion anomalies with indefinite clinical significance or even polyorchidism although no accessory testis could be demonstrated. However, the scrotal nubbin tissue which actually contains epididymis and vas is a potential decoy and may result in missing of the proximal testis if regarded as a sign of testicular atrophy and further evaluation is obviated. As this is retrospective study, actual incidence of the condition is yet to be determined.ConclusionA scrotal nubbin tissue may be secondary to epididymo-testicular nonunion as well as testicular atrophy. As feasibility of radiological imaging studies are limited, a laparoscopic exploration may be considered to confirm or to exclude a separate testis in patients with scrotal nubbin. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the actual incidence of the condition and gain-loss analysis of laparoscopic exploration[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Opportunities provided by remote sensing data for watershed management: example of Konya Closed Basin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data provides great opportunities in various steps of watershed management like characterization of watersheds that bear dynamic structure with large land, monitoring the physical variations within the basin, and conducting various scenario analyses to detect the response of the basin. The high resolution capacity of today's satellite images enables the production of land use/cover data of a basin in shorter period of time. In this study, it is aimed to demonstrate various aspects of remote sensing technology to be used in watershed management studies. For that purpose, MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel satellite data with different spatial resolutions were used to monitor the surface water bodies in Konya Closed Basin (KCB) of Turkey. In addition, high spatial Worldview-3 satellite data were used to extract detailed information about Akgol Wetland located in KCB. A methodology was developed on the utilization of remote sensing technology consisting of 3 main groups; field surveys, satellite images and ancillary data. In the study, 5 different spectral indices were applied to Sentinel 2 data to determine the areas of surface water bodies. Moreover, Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was applied to Worldview-3 satellite image to classify Akgol Wetland and its vicinity. The importance of establishing watershed information system together with a database reflecting the characteristics of watersheds was underlined. Various examples were given from KCB that is known as the largest closed basin of the country with a surface area of 5.426.480 ha. The basin owns 17 water bodies out of which 2 of them are RAMSAR sites. Within the scope of the study, information obtained from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images in the basin were discussed. More accurate results were achieved by Sentinel 2 than MODIS and Landsat data. In addition, detailed information about the wetland were extracted by means of Worldview-3 data and water bodies were monitored in all weather conditions via Sentinel 1 SAR data.

TI  - A synthesized approach for estimating the C-factor of RUSLE for a mixed-landscape watershed: A case study in the Gongshui watershed, southern China
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cover-management factor (C-factor) in the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) indicates the effects of vegetation cover and management practices on water erosion. The conditions governing the C-factor can be managed by farmers and managers to affect soil loss and soil carbon cycle. Currently, the most common approach for estimating the C-factor on large scales is using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) individually, which cannot precisely characterize the differences in the C-factor in various land-use types with the same degree of vegetation coverage. We developed a multiple-land-use synthesized C-factor (MLUS-C) model to capture the dynamics of the C-factor with a high spatio-temporal resolution for mixed-landscape watersheds. In this model, space-time fusion was executed based on mull-source remotely sensed data to estimate the phenological succession of vegetation cover, and the impacts of farmland management on large-scale evaluation of the C-factor were considered. A case study was conducted in the Gongshui watershed, southern China, where the dataset of precipitation and sediment yield covered a period of 11 years. We validated the simulation from the MLUS-C model and compared it with the results from NDVI-only approaches via conversion from the C-factor to sediment yield. The validation results showed that the MLUS-C model significantly improved the simulation accuracy and model adaptability. The root mean square error of our model was 71.5-95.5% lower than those of NDVI-only approaches. Our model has an advantage in estimating the C-factor in heterogeneous landscapes and provides a basis for implementing measurements to efficiently reduce soil loss.

TI  - A framework for estimating cloudy sky surface downward longwave radiation from the derived active and passive cloud property parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud-base temperature (CBT) is one of the parameters that dominates the cloudy sky surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR). However, CBT is rarely available at regional and global scales, and its application in estimating cloud sky SDLR is limited. In this study, a framework to globally estimate cloud sky SDLR during both daytime and nighttime is proposed. This framework is composed of three parts. First, a global cloudy property database was constructed by combing the extracted cloud vertical structure (CVS) parameters from the active CloudSat data and cloud properties from passive MODIS data. Second, the empirical methods for estimating cloud thickness (CT) under ISCCP cloud classification system and MODIS cloud classification system were developed. Additionally, the coefficients of CERES CT estimate models were refitted using the constructed cloud property database. With the estimated CT and reanalysis data, calculating the CBT is straightforward. The accuracy of the estimated CT for ISCCP cloud type is compared with the existing studies that were conducted at local scales. Our CT estimate accuracy is comparable to that of the existing studies. According to the validation results at ARM NSA and SGP stations, the CT estimated by the developed CT model for MODIS cloud type is better than that estimated by the original CERES CT model. Finally, the cloudy sky SDLR values were derived by feeding the estimated CBT and other parameters to the single-layer cloud model (SLCM). When validated by the ground measured SDLR collected from the SURFRAD network, the bias and RMSE are 5.42 W.m(-2) and 30.3 W.m(-2), respectively. This accuracy is comparable to the evaluation results of the mainstream SDLR products (Gui et al. 2010), the new evaluation results of SLCMs (Yu et al. 2018), and the accuracy of a new cloudy sky SDLR estimate method (Wang et al. 2018). All the derived CBTs improve the SDLR estimate accuracy more than the SLCM that directly uses cloud-top temperature (CTT). We will collect more ground measurements and continue to validate the developed framework in the future.

TI  - The predictive accuracy of satellite sign for hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage: A meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Satellite sign is a novel neuroimaging marker for predicting hematoma expansion (HE), which is closely related to unfavorable prognosis in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the predictive value of satellite sign varied according to previous studies. Thus, we conduct this metaanalysis to systematically review the application value of satellite sign in related studies.Methods: We searched the literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to April 10, 2020. Effect values, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio were pooled to assess the diagnostic value of satellite sign for HE in patients with ICH.Results: The meta-analysis included five studies with a total of 1493 patients. Results showed that the pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 0.50 (95 % CI, 0.31-0.70) and 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.56-0.83), respectively. In addition, the pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.7 (95 % CI, 1.5-2.1) and 0.70 (95 % CI, 0.54-0.89), respectively. No significant publication bias was found.Conclusion: Satellite sign exhibited moderate sensitivity and specificity for predicting HE in patients with ICH. Further studies are needed to explore its value in clinical application.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation phenology along the urban-rural gradient in Coastal Dalian, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies on vegetation phenology along the urban-rural gradient (URG) have focused on inland cities, with a comparative lack of research on coastal cities despite their different climatic background. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and land cover data to determine spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation phenology with respect to LST along the URG in China's coastal Dalian sub-province, with a focus on the main city of Dalian and three sub-cities (Pulandian, Wafangdian, and Zhuanghe). Our results were well-correlated with MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product (MCD12Q2) reference data and matched patterns found in previous studies, indicating that the amplitude method of TIMESAT for obtaining vegetation phenology is practical. Start of growing season (SOS) and end of growing season (EOS) of urban areas were earlier and later than rural areas, respectively. The four urban areas had dissimilar vegetation types and urbanization levels leading to different changes in SOS and EOS along the URG; the average oSOS (the difference in SOS along the URG) and oEOS (the difference in EOS along the URG) of the main and sub cities were 7.4 and 5.0 d, respectively. Changes in LST along the URG exhibited a non-linear relationship, with the maximum usually appearing 6-8 km from the urban areas. There was a strong linear relationship between vegetation phenology and LST along the URG. The winter-spring and yearly LSTs were negatively correlated with SOS, with both having roughly similar effects. The fall and yearly LSTs had significantly positive correlations with EOS, with the latter having a stronger effect. This study will be helpful for understanding climatic changes arising from urbanization in coastal areas and improving the management and productivity of the ecological environment.

TI  - Human activities and the natural environment have induced changes in the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Yunnan Province, China, over the past 19 years
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations exhibit distinct spatiotemporal heterogeneity, mainly due to the natural environment and human activities. Yunnan Province of China was selected as the research area, and a real-time measured PM2.5 concentration dataset was acquired from 41 monitoring stations in 16 major cities from February 2013 to December 2018. Aerosol optical depth (ACID) products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and data on four meteorological variables from 2000 to 2018 were employed. A novel hybrid model was constructed to estimate the historical missing PM2.5 values from 2000 to 2012, calculate the missing PM2.5 concentrations from 2012 to 2014 in some major cities, and analyze the driving factors of the PM2.5 concentration changes and causes of key pollution events in Yunnan Province over the past 19 years. The temporal analysis results indicate that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration in Yunnan Province exhibited three stages: continuous stability, a rapid increase and a rapid decrease. The year 2013 was an important breakpoint in the trend of the concentration change. The spatial analysis results reveal that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration in the north was lower than that in the south, and there was a significant difference between the east and the west. In addition, springtime biomass burning in Southeast Asia was found to be the main cause of PM2.5 pollution in Yunnan Province in spring. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Time Series Movement of the Cuolangma Glaciers, Southern Tibet with Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many debris-covered glaciers are broadly distributed across High Mountain Asia and have made a number of contributions to water circulation for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The formation of large supraglacial lakes poses risks for glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Therefore, it is important to monitor the movement of glaciers and to analyze their spatiotemporal characteristics. In this study we take Cuolangma glaciers in the central Himalayas as study targets, where glacier No.1 is a lake-terminating debris-covered glacier and glacier No.2 is a land-terminating debris-covered glacier. The 3D deformation time series is firstly estimated by using the Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subsets (PO-SBAS) based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets spanning from January to December 2018. Then the horizontal and vertical time series displacements are obtained to show their spatiotemporal features. The velocities of glacier No.1 in horizontal and vertical direction were up to 16.0 +/- 0.04 m/year and 3.4 +/- 0.42 m/year, respectively, and the ones of the glacier No.2 were 12.0 +/- 0.07 m/year and 2.0 +/- 0.27 m/year, respectively. Next, the correlation between the precipitation and the surface velocity suggests that the glacier velocity does not show a clear association with daily precipitation alone. Finally, the debris-covered glaciers evolution is evaluated which shows that the tongue of the glacier No.1 is wasting away and the transition of glacier No.2 from land-terminating to lake-terminating is a probable scenario in the later period of glacier wastage. This research can significantly serve for glacier multidimensional monitoring and the mitigation of hazardous disaster caused by debris-covered glaciers in the central Himalayas.

TI  - Crop Classification Method Based on Optimal Feature Selection and Hybrid CNN-RF Networks for Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although efforts and progress have been made in crop classification using optical remote sensing images, it is still necessary to make full use of the high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions of remote sensing images. However, with the increasing volume of remote sensing data, a key emerging issue in the field of crop classification is how to find useful information from massive data to balance classification accuracy and processing time. To address this challenge, we developed a novel crop classification method, combining optimal feature selection (OFSM) with hybrid convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) networks for multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. This research used 234 features including spectral, segmentation, color, and texture features from three scenes of Sentinel-2 images to identify crop types in the Jilin province of northeast China. To effectively extract the effective features of remote sensing data with lower time requirements, the use of OFSM was proposed with the results compared with two traditional feature selection methods (TFSM): random forest feature importance selection (RF-FI) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE). Although the time required for OFSM was 26.05 s, which was between RF-FI with 1.97 s and RF-RFE with 132.54 s, OFSM outperformed RF-FI and RF-RFE in terms of the overall accuracy (OA) of crop classification by 4% and 0.3%, respectively. On the basis of obtaining effective feature information, to further improve the accuracy of crop classification we designed two hybrid CNN-RF networks to leverage the advantages of one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG) with random forest (RF), respectively. Based on the selected optimal features using OFSM, four networks were tested for comparison: Conv1D-RF, VGG-RF, Conv1D, and VGG. Conv1D-RF achieved the highest OA at 94.27% as compared with VGG-RF (93.23%), Conv1D (92.59%), and VGG (91.89%), indicating that the Conv1D-RF method with optimal feature input provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation for multi-temporal crop-type classification.

TI  - Assessing the Fractional Abundance of Highly Mixed Salt-Marsh Vegetation Using Random Forest Soft Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are valuable and critical components of tidal landscapes, currently threatened by increasing rates of sea level rise, wave-induced lateral erosion, decreasing sediment supply, and human pressure. Halophytic vegetation plays an important role in salt-marsh erosional and depositional patterns and marsh survival. Mapping salt-marsh halophytic vegetation species and their fractional abundance within plant associations can provide important information on marsh vulnerability and coastal management. Remote sensing has often provided valuable methods for salt-marsh vegetation mapping; however, it has seldom been used to assess the fractional abundance of halophytes. In this study, we developed and tested a novel approach to estimate fractional abundance of halophytic species and bare soil that is based on Random Forest (RF) soft classification. This approach can fully use the information contained in the frequency of decision tree "votes" to estimate fractional abundance of each species. Such a method was applied to WorldView-2 (WV-2) data acquired for the Venice lagoon (Italy), where marshes are characterized by a high diversity of vegetation species. The proposed method was successfully tested against field observations derived from ancillary field surveys. Our results show that the new approach allows one to obtain high accuracy (6.7% < root-mean-square error (RMSE) < 18.7% and 0.65 < R-2 < 0.96) in estimating the sub-pixel fractional abundance of marsh-vegetation species. Comparing results obtained with the new RF soft-classification approach with those obtained using the traditional RF regression method for fractional abundance estimation, we find a superior performance of the novel RF soft-classification approach with respect to the existing RF regression methods. The distribution of the dominant species obtained from the RF soft classification was compared to the one obtained from an RF hard classification, showing that numerous mixed areas are wrongly labeled as populated by specific species by the hard classifier. As for the effectiveness of using WV-2 for salt-marsh vegetation mapping, feature importance analyses suggest that Yellow (584-632 nm), NIR 1 (near-infrared 1, 765-901 nm) and NIR 2 (near-infrared 2, 856-1043 nm) bands are critical in RF soft classification. Our results bear important consequences for mapping and monitoring vegetation-species fractional abundance within plant associations and their dynamics, which are key aspects in biogeomorphic analyses of salt-marsh landscapes.

TI  - Development and external validation of a nomogram to predict four or more positive nodes in breast cancer patients with one to three positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To develop a nomogram for predicting the possibility of four or more positive nodes in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN).Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of data of patients from two institutions was conducted. The inclusion criteria were: invasive breast cancer; clinically node negative; received lumpectomy or mastectomy plus SLN biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); and pathologically confirmed T1-2 tumor, with 1-3 positive SLNs. Patients from one institution formed the training group and patients from the other the validation group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictors of four or more positive nodes. These predictors were used to build the nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the accuracy of the model.Results: Of the 1480 patients (966 patients in the training group, 514 in the validation group), 306 (20.7%) had four or more positive nodes. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression showed number of positive (p < .001) and negative SLN (p < .001), extracapsular extension (p < .001), pT stage (p = .016), and tumor location in outer upper quadrant (p = .031) to be independent predictors of four or more positive nodes. The nomogram was built using these five factors. The AUC was 0.845 in the training group and 0.804 in the validation group.Conclusion: The proposed nomogram appears to accurately estimate the likelihood of four or more positive nodes and could help radiation oncologists to decide on use of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive nodes but no ALND.

TI  - GF-1 Satellite Observations of Suspended Sediment Injection of Yellow River Estuary, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the distribution of suspended sediments concentration (SSC) in the Yellow River Estuary based on data from GaoFen-1 (GF-1), which is a high-resolution satellite carrying a wide field-of-view (WFV) sensor and panchromatic and a multispectral (PMS) sensor on it. A new SSC retrieval model for the wide field-of-view sensor (M-WFV) was established based on the relationship between in-situ SSC and the reflectance in blue and near infrared bands. SSC obtained from 16 WFV1 images were analyzed in the Yellow River Estuary. The results show that (1) SSC in the study area is mainly 100-3500 mg/L, with the highest value being around 4500 mg/L. (2) The details of suspended sediment injection phenomenon were found in the Yellow River Estuary. The SSC distribution in the coastal water has two forms. One is that the high SSC water evenly distributes near the coast and the gradient of the SSC is similar. The other is that the high SSC water concentrates at the right side of the estuary (Laizhou Bay) with a significantly large area. Usually, there is a clear-water notch at the left side of the estuary. (3) Currents clearly influenced the SSC distribution in the Yellow River Estuary. The SSC gradient in the estuary was high against the local current direction. On the contrary, the SSC gradient in the estuary was small towards the local current direction. Eroding the coast and resuspension of the bottom sediments, together with currents, are the major factors influencing the SSC distribution in nearshore water in the Yellow River Estuary.

TI  - Investigating persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) technique efficiency for landslides mapping: a case study in Artvin dam area, in Turkey
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and determining landslides in dam reservoirs is very crucial as it is one of the main factors of dam failures in the world. Coruh river basin is one of the most important river basin in the Northeast part of Turkey which accompanies five big dams. Although persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) method is a powerful remote sensing technique which can measure and monitor displacements of the Earth's surface over time, its validation is a challenging issue because of the heterogeneous PS data. In this study, the efficiency of PSInSAR is investigated by proposing two different validation methods in order to see the consistency of the determined mean deformation velocities obtained with series of Sentinel-1A SAR-images. In the first method, 3D coordinates of reference points are projected to 1D displacement values in line of sight direction and then compared with the radar displacements of PS points. In the second method, new displacement values of PS points around reference points are identified from an interpolation map in order to be compared with the original displacements of reference points. In the end, it is showed that the displacements found by PSInSAR method are consistent with the reference points' displacements measured in the study area. Finally, this work's specific objectives are to present solutions to the challenging validation problem, to show the effectiveness of PSInSAR method and to describe the remaining challenges in PS analysis of landslide applications in dam areas.

T2  - AGRI-THE JOURNAL OF THE TURKISH SOCIETY OF ALGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of anesthesia can include the need to accommodate surgical interventions on multiple extremities in a single procedure. General anesthesia is usually preferred in such cases in order to prevent an overdose of local anesthetics. One of the major benefits of using ultrasonography to provide regional anesthesia is that it facilitates reducing the local anesthetic drug dose required to obtain a successful block.The use of multiple, ultrasound-guided extremity blocks can be a reasonable alternative approach to general anesthesia, especially in high-risk patients. This report describes the case of a patient with malignant melanoma of the left lateral forearm. Surgical resection of the lesion, dissection of the axillary sentinel lymph node, and grafting from the lateral left thigh were planned. As the surgical procedure involved more than one extremity, a combination of anesthetic blocks was applied using ultrasound guidance. The use of supraclavicular, intercostobrachial, and lateral femoral cutaneous blocks is explained in the context of the literature.

TI  - An achievement test for Chinese preschool children: Validity and social correlates
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Early childhood is a crucial period for human development that has long-term implications for one's life trajectories. During the years before formal schooling, brain size and structures, as well as cognitive abilities, undergo rapid development. Children's cognitive abilities develop by leaps and bounds and show great malleability. Cognitive development during early childhood exerts a long-lasting influence on children's life chances in adulthood. In China, however, there is no established reliable early childhood achievement test that can be used in a study. This study validates an achievement test for Chinese preschoolers. We analyze data from a nationally representative sample of children aged three to six who participated in the Zhang-Yeung Test of Achievement for Chinese Children (ZY-TACC) in 2012. The instrument consists of a 28-item verbal test and a 24-item numeracy test. Our evaluations indicate a satisfactory level of difficulty, as well as high internal consistency and reliability. This instrument exhibits ample ability to distinguish among children of different ages and varying family backgrounds in ways consistent with previous literature. Children's test scores are also found to correlate in the expected direction with their behavioral indicators. We demonstrate that the ZY-TACC is a psychometrically robust, culturally and contextually appropriate instrument for assessing Chinese preschool children's achievement. The instrument can make a significant contribution to research on early childhood development in China.

TI  - The abnormal change of air quality and air pollutants induced by the forest fire in Sumatra and Borneo in 2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We comprehensively integrated various remote sensing, modeling and meteorological datasets to assess and quantify the effects of Indonesia's forest fires in 2015 on the ambient atmosphere. When the forest fires occurred, the fire spots in Sumatra and Borneo increased sharply to 78,055 and fire radiative power (FRP) rose to 4.05 x 10(6) MW in September-October 2015. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and the retrieved concentration of PM2.5 around these two islands also peaked during this period. With the remote sensing data from 2016 and 2017 as the background, we found that the carbon monoxide (CO) anomalies along the equatorial Indian and Pacific Oceans (25 degrees S to 25 degrees N and 40 degrees E to 160 degrees E) reached 10.32 +/- 0.58 ML and 25.05 1.35 ML in September and October 2015, respectively. Meanwhile, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) changes were not so obvious; the NO2 anomalies within Sumatra and Borneo were only 0.46 +/- 0.14 Kt and 0.49 +/- 0.17 Kt, respectively. All the four indicators (AOD, PM2 5 concentration, CO and NO2 anomalies) revealed that the ambient air quality in October 2015 was even worse than that in September. The precipitation anomaly (PA) of these two islands decreased to -1.89 mm/day in September 2015, which is assumed to be the main meteorological factor to induce the forest fires. During the 1997/1998 El Nino event, the PA decreased to -3.04 mm/day on October 1997 and temperature anomaly (TA) increased to 1.52 degrees C on March 1998, the variation of which is more significant than other two El Nino events in 1982/1983 and 2015/2016.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the current study, the utility of sentinel node (SN) identification using indocyanine green (ICG) was investigated for oral cancers in the clinical N0 stage. The current study was a prospective, multicentre, phase II clinical trial that was conducted in Japan. A total of 18 patients were included. Before surgery, the patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy to map the SNs. During surgery, radioactive isotope (RI) mapping was used to detect the SNs, and ICG was subsequently injected. ICG mapping of the SNs was then performed through the skin. The primary tumour was resected, and a neck flap was elevated for neck dissection, followed by SN biopsy (SNB) using RI or ICG mapping. With the RI method, a total of 63 SNs were detected. Among these SNs, 8 (12.7%) were positive for metastasis, including those with isolated tumour cells (ITCs). The median number of SNs per patient identified by SNB was 4. With the ICG method, a total of 67 SNs were detected. Among these SNs, 7 (10.4%) were positive for metastasis, including those with ITCs. The median number of SNs per patient identified by SNB was 4 (range, 1-6). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of all patients was 83.3%, and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of all patients was 76.7%. The neck compression technique is a simple method that can be used to facilitate surgical procedures of ICG fluorescence navigated SNB for head and neck cancer.

AB  - Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is a key indicator of the ecosystem response to climate change and land use/cover change (LUCC) in arid areas. The available global GPP data sets cannot meet the demands for local applications in arid areas due to sparse vegetation and extreme climate conditions. Here, we developed a novel GPP estimation model for the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest inland river basin in northern China, and disentangled the impacts of climate change and LUCC on GPP. First, we calibrated the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) using CO2 flux observations from multiple stations in the HRB and developed a modified local GPP model (HRB-VPM). Then, we decoupled the joint effects of LUCC and climate change on GPP based on the log and differential transformation method. The results showed that HRB-VPM outperformed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and VPM GPP models in arid ecosystems. The root mean square error of HRB-VPM was 4.9 and 1.5 gCm(-2) day(-1) lower than those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and VPM models, respectively. We concluded that the underlying driving forces of the GPP changes were distinct across the HRB. In the upper reach, climate change accounted for 65.8% of GPP changes, while in the middle and lower reaches, LUCC contributed to 75.1% of GPP changes. Our research provides an effective way to monitor arid ecosystem degradation and is useful for mitigating the negative impacts of human activities and future climate change.

TI  - A novel GIS-based ensemble technique for rangeland downward trend mapping as an ecological indicator change
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands provide important ecosystem services worldwide. The present study was aimed to map rangeland degradation in a critical mountainous rangeland ecosystem of Iran. The study was carried out based on seven years intensive fieldwork and recording 1147 locations with downward trends in the quality of the rangelands. Twelve conditional factors and two important ensemble algorithms including Probability density-Index of en-tropy (PD-IOE) and Frequency ratio-Index of entropy (FR-IOE), were used to produce rangeland downward trend (RDT) susceptibility maps. The results of validation showed that PD-IOE hybrid model with area under curve (AUC = 0.901) and standard error (SE = 0.011) is more accurate than FR-IOE hybrid model (AUC = 0.881 and SE = 0.012). In addition, our results indicate that altitude, distance to river, and distance to road are the most important factors for rangeland degradation. In addition, the places with higher altitude and less distance to roads and rivers endured more degradation and these places have downward trends. Based on the achieved results, 2% and 10% of study area fall into the very high and high classes of downward trends, respectively. Overgrazing and early grazing are two main drivers for rangeland degradation in the study area, and the ran-geland managers and decision makers should define and develop strategies to reduce pressure on rangelands and promote strategies to restore these important ecosystems.

TI  - Hyperspectral Imagery Classification Based on Multiscale Superpixel-Level Constraint Representation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse representation (SR)-based models have been widely applied for hyperspectral image classification. In our previously established constraint representation (CR) model, we exploited the underlying significance of the sparse coefficient and proposed the participation degree (PD) to represent the contribution of the training sample in representing the testing pixel. However, the spatial variants of the original residual error-driven frameworks often suffer the obstacles to optimization due to the strong constraints. In this paper, based on the object-based image classification (OBIC) framework, we firstly propose a spectral-spatial classification method, called superpixel-level constraint representation (SPCR). Firstly, it uses the PD in respect to the sparse coefficient from CR model. Then, transforming the individual PD to a united activity degree (UAD)-driven mechanism via a spatial constraint generated by the superpixel segmentation algorithm. The final classification is determined based on the UAD-driven mechanism. Considering that the SPCR is susceptible to the segmentation scale, an improved multiscale superpixel-level constraint representation (MSPCR) is further proposed through the decision fusion process of SPCR at different scales. The SPCR method is firstly performed at each scale, and the final category of the testing pixel is determined by the maximum number of the predicated labels among the classification results at each scale. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral datasets including a GF-5 satellite data verified the efficiency and practicability of the two proposed methods.

TI  - Refocusing High-Resolution SAR Images of Complex Moving Vessels Using Co-Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase the global convergence and processing efficiency of particle swarm optimization (PSO) applied in the adaptive joint time-frequency, in this study an improved PSO is proposed to refocus the high-resolution SAR images of complex moving vessels in high sea states. According to the characteristics of the high-order multi-component polynomial phase signal, this algorithm provides parallel processing and co-evolution methods by setting the different permissions of the sub-population and sharing its search information. As a result, the multiple components can be extracted simultaneously. Experiments were conducted using the simulation data and Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR data. Results showed the processing speed increased by more than 40% and the global convergence was significantly improved. The imaging results verify the efficiency and robustness of this co-evolutionary PSO.

TI  - Assessment of Cornfield LAI Retrieved from Multi-Source Satellite Data Using Continuous Field LAI Measurements Based on a Wireless Sensor Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and continuous monitoring of leaf area index (LAI), a widely-used vegetation structural parameter, is crucial to characterize crop growth conditions and forecast crop yield. Meanwhile, advancements in collecting field LAI measurements have provided strong support for validating remote-sensing-derived LAI. This paper evaluates the performance of LAI retrieval from multi-source, remotely sensed data through comparisons with continuous field LAI measurements. Firstly, field LAI was measured continuously over periods of time in 2018 and 2019 using LAINet, a continuous LAI measurement system deployed using wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, over an agricultural region located at the Heihe watershed at northwestern China. Then, cloud-free images from optical satellite sensors, including Landsat 7 the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 the Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2A/B Multispectral Instrument (MSI), were collected to derive LAI through inversion of the PROSAIL radiation transfer model using a look-up-table (LUT) approach. Finally, field LAI data were used to validate the multi-temporal LAI retrieved from remote-sensing data acquired by different satellite sensors. The results indicate that good accuracy was obtained using different inversion strategies for each sensor, while Green Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen) and a combination of three red-edge bands perform better for Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 LAI inversion, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated LAI has good consistency with in situ measurements at vegetative stage (coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.74, and root mean square error RMSE = 0.53 m(2) m(-2)). At the reproductive stage, a significant underestimation was found (R-2 = 0.41, and 0.89 m(2) m(-2) in terms of RMSE). This study suggests that time-series LAI can be retrieved from multi-source satellite data through model inversion, and the LAINet instrument could be used as a low-cost tool to provide continuous field LAI measurements to support LAI retrieval.

TI  - Topography, drainage capability, and legacy of drought differentiate tropical ecosystem response to and recovery from major hurricanes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-carbon sequestrations of tropical montane forests and coastal mangroves have been greatly disturbed by intensified extreme climate events such as alternating hurricanes and droughts. However, few studies of the hurricane impact have taken into consideration the legacy of past climate events and analyzed the heterogeneity of hurricane impacts between montane forests and coastal mangroves. Here, we studied the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 on coastal mangroves and upland forests in Puerto Rico after a severe drought during 2015-2016. We investigated the island-wide immediate impact on greenness using fused vegetation index from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, and the impact on and the recovery of 62 homogeneous vegetation patches by deriving an impact index and one-year recovery ratio (RR). A linear mixed-effect model was applied to explore roles of hurricane wind, rainfall, topography, and biological components in the impact and the recovery. Island-wide, the immediate impact is highly spatial-heterogeneous. Although most of the island was browned, a green-up strip in the dry south showed benefits from the hurricane rain which relieved the prior drought stress. Coastal mangroves experienced the greatest impact and slowest recovery with relative recovery of 0.44 compared to recovery greater than 0.70 for upland forests, and evergreen forests sustained significantly more damage than deciduous forests. The recovery of evergreen forests was on average 11 days earlier and faster than that of mangroves. Mangrove recovery was mostly limited by inundation-related factors such as elevation, slope, and drainage capacity. While higher elevation relates to slower recovery for upland forests, it favors mangrove recovery. Particularly, mangrove recovery is facilitated by river presence, explaining 65% variation in RR. The differentiated response, recovery, and underlying mechanisms highlighted a complicated array of external forces, geophysical/ biological modulators, and legacy of past climate events in determining and understanding hurricanes' impact on tropical ecosystems.

TI  - A Novel Model Integrating Deep Learning for Land Use/Cover Change Reconstruction: A Case Study of Zhenlai County, Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, land use/cover change (LUCC) due to urbanization, deforestation, and desertification has dramatically increased, which changes the global landscape and increases the pressure on the environment. LUCC not only accelerates global warming but also causes widespread and irreversible loss of biodiversity. Therefore, LUCC reconstruction has important scientific and practical value for studying environmental and ecological changes. The commonly used LUCC reconstruction models can no longer meet the growing demand for uniform and high-resolution LUCC reconstructions. In view of this circumstance, a deep learning-integrated LUCC reconstruction model (DLURM) was developed in this study. Zhenlai County of Jilin Province (1986-2013) was taken as an example to verify the proposed DLURM. The average accuracy of the DLURM reached 92.87% (compared with the results of manual interpretation). Compared with the results of traditional models, the DLURM had significantly better accuracy and robustness. In addition, the simulation results generated by the DLURM could match the actual land use (LU) map better than those generated by other models.

TI  - A new accuracy evaluation method for water body extraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper employs the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Near-Infrared (NIR) threshold methods to extract the boundaries of Hongjiannao Lake, Zasak reservoir and Changjiagou reservoir. The real boundary of the water bodies was obtained by visual interpretation from high-resolution imagery. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) is further used to calculate the net shoreline movement (NSM) between the real lake boundary and the lake boundary extracted by the NDWI, AWEI, MNDWI and NIR threshold methods. We quantitatively evaluated the accuracy of each water body extraction method by NSM, which was competed with kappa coefficient (kappa) and edge detection. The results showed that the average of the |NSM| of the NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI and NIR threshold methods are 12.77 m, 16.76 m, 28.65 m and 31.43 m, respectively. The kappa is 0.9869, 0.9855, 0.9747 and 0.9736, respectively and the correct extracted (T) ratios for the edge detection are 84.06%, 82.68%, 56.8% and 53.52%, respectively. The mean value of |NSM| for NDWI is the smallest, while kappa andTare the highest. It indicates that the accuracy of NDWI is the highest in Hongjiannao lake. The smaller the |NSM| is, the larger kappa and the higherTare. This shows that the |NSM| is consistent with the commonly used accuracy verification method such as kappa and edge detection. The results of water extraction from the other two reservoirs also support this conclusion. Therefore, the accuracy verification of NSM can reflect the spatial position information and has reliability. It provides a new approach in verifying the accuracy of water body extraction methods. The optimum water extraction index for different study areas is different. The NIR band threshold method and AWEI can accurately extract water boundaries with a small amount of aquatic vegetation. However, NDWI and MNDWI are more suitable for extracting water bodies located in complex terrains.

TI  - Land Cover Classification Using Extremely Randomized Trees: A Kernel Perspective
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of the ever-increasing collections of remotely sensed images is a key but challenging task. In this letter, we introduce the use of extremely randomized trees known as Extra-Trees (ET) to create a similarity kernel [ET kernel (ETK)] that is subsequently used in a support vector machine (SVM) to create a novel classifier. The performance of this classifier is benchmarked against that of a standard ET, an SVM with both conventional radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and a recently introduced random forest-based kernel (RFK). A time series of Worldview-2 images over smallholder farms is used to illustrate our study. Four sets of features were obtained from these images by extending their original spectral bands with vegetation indices and textures derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrices. This allows testing the performance of the classifiers in low- and high-dimensional problems. Our results for the high-dimensional experiments show that the SVM with tree-based kernels provide better overall accuracies than with the RBF kernel. For problems with lower dimensionality, SVM-ETK slightly outperforms SVM-RFK and SVM-RBF. Moreover, SVM-ETK outperforms ET in most of the experiments. Besides an improved overall accuracy, the main advantage of ETK is its relatively low computational cost compared to the parameterization of the RBF and RFK. Thus, the proposed SVM-ETK classifier is an efficient alternative to common classifiers, especially in problems involving high-dimensional data sets.

T2  - REVISTA INCLUSIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines proverbial units in relation to the concept viewed as the cognitive structure of knowledge. The relevance of this research area derives from theoretical and practical issues in modern linguistics that focuses on linguistic identity, interaction between language and culture as well as the linguistic worldview encrypted in the language in general and in the proverbial lexicon in particular. Language reinforces and implements the results of human reflective mental activities. Proverbs and sayings most clearly demonstrate this point, as they represent the distinctive features of the mentality, cognition and worldview of a nation speaking a specific language, along with its cultural values. The study focuses on the following objectives: determining basic representations of the conceptual content of the notion of money; identifying lexical units that are representative of this concept in Russian and French linguistic mentalities; classifying proverbs according to frames reflecting the multidimensional content of proverbs related to the concept under investigation; and describing the universal and national components of importance for the linguistic awareness of the Russians and the French. The author used a method known as the definitional analysis with a view to identify the main points of the conceptual content of the notion of money and the corpus of lexical representatives of the concept under consideration. The above-mentioned method revealed that basic representations of the conceptual content of the notion of money and comparisons of Russian and French dictionary entries for 'money' / 'argent' generally coincide. The concept of MONEY verbalized by Russian and French proverbial units can be regarded as a special type of proverbial concepts. Combining several research methods, including the definitional analysis, the cognitive and semantic analysis of proverbs and the frame classification of proverbs proved to be a highly fruitful approach. Frames are an efficient way to transmit information and to speed up its processing, given that they contain both apparent and hidden/implied data.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Technique to Upscale Methane Emission Flux in a Subtropical Peatland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of methane (CH4) gas emission from peat is critical to understand CH4 budget from natural wetlands under a climate warming scenario. Previous studies have focused on prediction and mapping of CH4 emission flux using process-based models, while application of statistical-empirical models for upscaling spatially sparse in situ measurements is scarce. In this study, we developed an empirical remote sensing upscaling approach to estimate CH4 emission flux in the Everglades using limited in situ point-based CH4 emission flux measurements and Landsat data during 2013-2018. We spatially and temporally linked in situ data with Landsat surface reflectance based on temporally composite data sets and developed an object-based machine learning framework to model and map CH4 emission flux. An ensemble analysis of two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), shows that the upscaling approach is promising for predicting CH4 emission flux with a R-2 of 0.65 and 0.87 based on a fivefold cross-validation for a dry season and wet season estimation, respectively. We generated emission flux map products that successfully revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CH4 emission within the dominant freshwater marsh ecosystem in the Everglades. We conclude that Landsat is promising for upscaling and monitoring CH4 emission flux and reducing the uncertainty in emission estimates from wetlands.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Method Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on Gabor Transform and Attention Mechanism with Dark Channel Subnet for Remote Sensing Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection, as a crucial step, has always been a hot topic in the field of optical remote sensing image processing. In this paper, we propose a deep learning cloud detection Network that is based on the Gabor transform and Attention modules with Dark channel subnet (NGAD). This network is based on the encoder-decoder framework. The information on texture is an important feature that is often used in traditional cloud detection methods. The NGAD enhances the attention of the network towards important texture features in the remote sensing images through the proposed Gabor feature extraction module. The channel attention module that is based on the larger scale features and spatial attention module that is based on the dark channel subnet have been introduced in NGAD. The channel attention module highlights the important information in a feature map from the channel dimensions, weakens the useless information, and helps the network to filter this information. A dark channel subnet with spatial attention module has been designed in order to further reduce the influence of the redundant information in the extracted features. By introducing a "dark channel", the information in the feature map is reconstructed from the spatial dimension. The NGAD is validated while using the Gaofen-1 WFV imagery in four spectral bands. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of NGAD reaches 97.42% and the false alarm rate reaches 2.22%. The efficiency of cloud detection using NGAD exceeds the state-of-art image segmentation network model and remote sensing image cloud detection model.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOBASED MATERIALS AND BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities and the demand for biomass and biobased energy can lead to changes in land use. Songyuan City is a typical farming-pastoral ecotone in northeast China, to investigate the land use change in this area, the Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images in 2000, 2010 and 2019 were analyzed. The land use in the ecotone in 2030 was predicted, as well as the changing characteristic of its ecosystem services value (ESV). The results showed that paddy field has had the highest annual growth rate and the ESV has increased by 338.6 million Chinese Yuan (CNY) in the past 19 years. The areas of dry field, paddy field, water bodies, wetland, and building land showed an upward trend with the dry field having the most growth of 49,596 hm(2), whereas the areas of forestland, meadowland, and unused land showed a downward trend; and ESV increases from 3.5714 billion CNY in 2010 to 3.6236 billion CNY in 2030. Accuracy check and sensitivity analysis indicated a reliable result, which could provide reference to the ecologically sustainable development.

TI  - A Feature Difference Convolutional Neural Network-Based Change Detection Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection based on remote sensing (RS) images has a wide range of applications in many fields. However, many existing approaches for detecting changes in RS images with complex land covers still have room for improvement. In this article, a high-resolution RS image change detection approach based on a deep feature difference convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. This approach uses a CNN to learn the deep features from RS images and then uses transfer learning to compose a two-channel network with shared weight to generate a multiscale and multidepth feature difference map for change detection. The network is trained by a change magnitude guided loss function proposed in this article and needs to train with only a few pixel-level samples to generate change magnitude maps, which can help to remove some of the pseudochanges. Finally, the binary change map can be obtained by a threshold. The approach is tested on several data sets from different sensors, including WorldView-3, QuickBird, and Ziyuan-3. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better performance compared with other classic approaches and has fewer missed detections and false alarms, which proves that the proposed approach has strong robustness and generalization ability.

TI  - Integrating Landsat Time Series Observations and Corona Images to Characterize Forest Change Patterns in a Mining Region of Nanjing, Eastern China from 1967 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term surface mining and subsequent vegetation recovery greatly alter land cover types, reshape landscape patterns and impose several impacts on local ecosystem services. However, studies on the history of forest changes in mining areas from the 1960s to the present have not been reported. This study developed a new idea to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest cover in a mining area of Mufu Mountain (Mt. Mufu) from 1967 to 2019 by integrating Landsat and Corona data, and to explore the relationships among the forest changes, landscape structures and ecosystem functions. Firstly, we applied the vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm and visual interpretation to create annual forest change datasets. Subsequently, the forest loss process was divided into subdivision, shrinkage, perforation and attrition components. An improved forest restoration model in this study extended the recovery process to bridge, branch, infilling and increment components. Finally, remote sensing variables and crown density were coupled to assess the forest aboveground biomass (AGB) to reflect the ecosystem function in the restoration area. Results showed that the combined use of Corona and the dense time series of Landsat can provide more detailed information on forest changes. Forest cover sharply decreased from 343.89 in 1967 to 298.44 ha in 1990, and after 2003, the forest area substantially increased and finally reached a maximum of 434.16 ha in 2019. Subdivision and bridge not only occupied the larger areas in the process of forest loss and restoration, but also they had strong correlations with forest changes and the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were respectively 0.96 and 0.91. These all revealed that forest changes mainly affected landscape structure connectivity. The total forest AGB of Mt. Mufu increased from 20,173.35 in 2006 to 31,035.77 t in 2017, but the increases in AGB were only 30-40 t/ha in most recovery areas with high structure connectivity (bridge regions), indicating there is room for improving restoration projects in the future. The obtained findings can provide mining site restoration managers with clear, long-term forest change information and mine restoration assessment methods.

TI  - Probabilistic Numerical Modeling of Compound Flooding Caused by Tropical Storm Matthew Over a Data-Scarce Coastal Environment
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The passage of a tropical storm, as the main driver of storm surge and high waves in many coastal regions, can also generate heavy rainfall and cause river overflow. The resulting combination of riverine, pluvial, and coastal flood hazard can result in catastrophic losses particularly in densely populated coastal environments. In this study, we characterize compound flooding caused by Tropical Storm Matthew and assess the significance and associated uncertainties of multiple contributing factors over a data-scarce coastal region. A hydrological model combined with a simplified two-dimensional hydrodynamic model are set up and validated to investigate the compounding effects of storm tide, wave runup, rainfall, and river overflow at the southern coast of Saint Lucia in the Caribbean Sea. Pleiades-1 and Sentinel-1 satellite imageries are used to determine the flood-impacted areas. The analyses are performed based on deterministic and probabilistic approaches and the effects of uncertain boundary conditions and model parameters are investigated. Results show that the individual analysis of flood hazards, in isolation, can lead to substantial underestimation of flood risks. Heavy rainfall and wave runup are the most significant contributors to compound flooding in Saint Lucia. In addition, the interactions between seawater and streamflow can exacerbate riverine flood hazards particularly upstream of the river mouth. Communities in western Vieux Fort, and the Hewanorra International Airport, have high exposure to compound flooding, which is projected to intensify under climate change.

TI  - Using LiDAR-DEM based rapid flood inundation modelling framework to map floodplain inundation extent and depth
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping floods is important for policy makers to make timely decisions in regards to emergency responses and future planning. It is therefore crucial to develop a rapid inundation modelling framework to map flood inundation. This study develops an airborne scanning laser altimetry (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) based Rapid flood Inundation Modelling framework (LiDAR-RIM) for assessment of inundation extent, depth, volume and duration for flood events. The modelling framework has been applied to the mid-Murrumbidgee region in the southeast Murray-Darling Basin, Australia for two flood events occurred in December 2010 and March 2012. The inundation extents estimated using this methodology compared well to those obtained from two Landsat ETM+ images, demonstrating suitability and applicability of this method. For testing possibility of larger area application, the framework also uses 30-m resolution shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM)-DEM to replace LiDAR-DEM for the same modelling. The inundation extents obtained by using the SRTM-DEM are smaller than those obtained using the LiDAR-DEM, especially for large flood events. A possible reason is that the river cross sections obtained from the SRTM-DEM are not accurate enough for inundation modelling. The LiDAR-RIM has an advantage for process modelling and scenario modelling under future climatic conditions.

TI  - Evaluating Spatial Heterogeneity of Land Surface Hydrothermal Conditions in the Heihe River Basin
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface hydrothermal conditions (LSHCs) reflect land surface moisture and heat conditions, and play an important role in energy and water cycles in soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Based on comparison of four evaluation methods (namely, the classic statistical method, geostatistical method, information theory method, and fractal method), this study proposed a new scheme for evaluating the spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs. This scheme incorporates diverse remotely sensed surface parameters, e.g., leaf area index-LAI, the normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, net radiation-Rn, and land surface temperature-LST. The LSHCs can be classified into three categories, namely homogeneous, moderately heterogeneous and highly heterogeneous based on the remotely sensed LAI data with a 30 m spatial resolution and the combination of normalized information entropy (S ') and coefficient of variation (CV). Based on the evaluation scheme, the spatial heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions at six typical flux observation stations in the Heihe River Basin during the vegetation growing season were evaluated. The evaluation results were consistent with the land surface type characteristics exhibited by Google Earth imagery and spatial heterogeneity assessed by high resolution remote sensing evapotranspiration data. Impact factors such as precipitation and irrigation events, spatial resolutions of remote sensing data, heterogeneity in the vertical direction, topography and sparse vegetation could also affect the evaluation results. For instance, short-term changes (precipitation and irrigation events) in the spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs can be diagnosed by energy factors, while long-term changes can be indicated by vegetation factors. The spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs decreases when decreasing the spatial resolution of remote sensing data. The proposed evaluation scheme would be useful for the quantification of spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs over flux observation stations toward the global scale, and also contribute to the improvement of the accuracy of estimation and validation for remotely sensed (or model simulated) evapotranspiration.

TI  - How Do Urban Parks Provide Bird Habitats and Birdwatching Service? Evidence from Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Parks are an important green infrastructure. Besides other benefits for human and animals, parks provide important bird habitats and accommodate most human-bird interactions in cities. Understanding the complex dynamics among park characteristics, bird habitats and park attractiveness to birdwatchers will inform park designers and managers. However, previous studies often examined factors influencing bird habitats and birdwatching activities separately. To fill this gap, we aim to study the whole picture of "parks, birds and birdwatchers" in Beijing, China for its spatial patterns and possible factors which influence bird habitat areas and birdwatching services. We conducted a three-month bird census in at 159 sites and mapped bird habitat areas in parks of Beijing through the maximum entropy method based on results of the bird survey as well as high-resolution remote sensing data. We derived the number of birdwatching records to describe birdwatching activities from the China Birdwatching Record Center website. We used correlation analysis, regression and analysis of variance to investigate factors that may influence areas of bird habitats and the number of birdwatching records for each park. Our results showed that among the 102 parks, 61 provide habitats to breeding birds with an average of 17 ha, and 26 parks generated a total of 330 birdwatching records. Park size, age, proportion of pavement, landscape connectedness, pavement largest patch index and woodland patch density explained 95% of the variation in habitat areas altogether. Bird habitat area alone explained 65% of the variation in the number of birdwatching records. Furthermore, parks with birdwatching records are significantly larger, older, closer to the city center and more accessible than those have no reported birdwatching. These findings have important implications for park management. While park size or age cannot be easily changed, modifying landscape patterns can increase bird habitats in parks, and improving accessibility may attract more birdwatchers to parks that already have considerable bird habitats.

TI  - Global and Local Modeling of Land Use Change in the Border Cities of Laredo, Texas, USA and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico: A Comparative Analysis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper estimates global logistic regression and logistic geographically weighted regression (GWR) models of urban growth in the adjacent border cities of Laredo, Texas in the United States and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas in Mexico, for two time periods from 1985 to 2014. Historical land use and land cover patterns were monitored through Landsat imagery from the United States Geological Survey to identify instances of urban growth through land type change. Data on socioeconomic variables related to urban growth were collected from various sources and used as independent variables. In both time periods, the logistic GWR was proven to be a complementary model for the global logistic regression to explore the urban growth effect. In addition, GWR outperformed the global logistic regression model with respect to goodness of fit. These results suggest that local models are complementary to global models to empirically analyze the determinants of urban growth in study areas that contain political borders, presumably because the relationships between socioeconomic factors and urban growth are characterized by spatial heterogeneity in such areas. The spatial variable of the relationship between urban growth and the neighborhood interactions and proximity effect present the idea of complexity and interconnections between the land use change and associated factors.

TI  - Long-term (2002-2017) impacts of Danjiangkou dam on thermal regimes of downstream Han River (China) using Landsat thermal infrared imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work quantified the long-term (2002-2017) impacts of the Danjiangkou dam (China) on the thermal regimes of downstream Han River using Landsat thermal infrared imageries, with an emphasis on the effect of dam heightening. The accuracy assessment of satellite-derived temperatures indicated a root-mean-square error of 0.95 degrees C, suggesting an accurate retrieval of water temperature. The long-term analysis detected a seasonal cycle of thermal impacts, with strong cooling in summer, moderate cooling in spring and autumn whereas no significant changes in winter. The cycle was likely attributed to the seasonal thermal stratification in the dammed reservoir. The analysis also revealed a pronounced year-to-year variability in the thermal impacts. This was especially the case after the heightening of dam in 2013, which led to a stronger cooling effect and a longer cooling duration. The inter-annual variability can be largely explained by the varying reservoir water levels associated with dam operation and dam heightening, as well as tributary inflows and water diversion projects. The longitudinal thermal profile analysis suggested at least a length of 20 km downstream river was thermally affected. The cooling effects may be significant to the aquatic ecosystems of downstream river, especially with respect to the delay of Famous Four species of Chinese Carp spawning or the reduction and downstream shift of spawning sites. The findings provide new scientific understandings about the long-term seasonal thermal regimes of dammed rivers and the techniques can be extended to the global scale to investigate thermal effects of large dams.

TI  - Joint Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using Hierarchical Random Walk and Deep CNN Architecture
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation using multisensor data is drawing increasing attention. Fusing remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data helps to increase application performance. In this article, joint classification of hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data is investigated using an effective hierarchical random walk network (HRWN). In the proposed HRWN, a dual-tunnel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is first developed to capture spectral and spatial features. A pixelwise affinity branch is proposed to capture the relationships between classes with different elevation information from LiDAR data and confirm the spatial contrast of classification. Then in the designed hierarchical random walk layer, the predicted distribution of dual-tunnel CNN serves as global prior while pixelwise affinity reflects the local similarity of pixel pairs, which enforce spatial consistency in the deeper layers of networks. Finally, a classification map is obtained by calculating the probability distribution. Experimental results validated with three real multisensor remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed HRWN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. For example, the two branches CNN classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.91 on the University of Houston campus data set, while the proposed HRWN classifier obtains an accuracy of 93.61, resulting in an improvement of approximately 5.

TI  - Characterizing the Error and Bias of Remotely Sensed LAI Products: An Example for Tropical and Subtropical Evergreen Forests in South China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area is a key parameter underpinning ecosystem carbon, water and energy exchanges via photosynthesis, transpiration and absorption of radiation, from local to global scales. Satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) can provide estimates of leaf area index (LAI) with global coverage and high temporal frequency. However, the error and bias contained within these EO products and their variation in time and across spatial resolutions remain poorly understood. Here, we used nearly 8000 in situ measurements of LAI from six forest environments in southern China to evaluate the magnitude, uncertainty, and dynamics of three widely used EO LAI products. The finer spatial resolution GEOV3 PROBA-V 300 m LAI product best estimates the observed LAI from a multi-site dataset (R-2 = 0.45, bias = -0.54 m(2) m(-2), RMSE = 1.21 m(2) m(-2)) and importantly captures canopy dynamics well, including the amplitude and phase. The GEOV2 PROBA-V 1 km LAI product performed the next best (R-2 = 0.36, bias = -2.04 m(2) m(-2), RMSE = 2.32 m(2) m(-2)) followed by MODIS 500 m LAI (R-2 = 0.20, bias = -1.47 m(2) m(-2), RMSE = 2.29 m(2) m(-2)). The MODIS 500 m product did not capture the temporal dynamics observed in situ across southern China. The uncertainties estimated by each of the EO products are substantially smaller (3-5 times) than the observed bias for EO products against in situ measurements. Thus, reported product uncertainties are substantially underestimated and do not fully account for their total uncertainty. Overall, our analysis indicates that both the retrieval algorithm and spatial resolution play an important role in accurately estimating LAI for the dense canopy forests in Southern China. When constraining models of the carbon cycle and other ecosystem processes are run, studies should assume that current EO product LAI uncertainty estimates underestimate their true uncertainty value.

TI  - A thirty-year Landsat study reveals changes to a river-lake junction ecosystem after implementation of the three Gorges dam
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems at the junctions of large lakes and rivers are a significant resource which are yet susceptible to changes in the various water bodies. One of the most crucial river-lake junction points in China is the junction of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River (JPLYR), with the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) upstream. Based on remote sensing images of the dry season from 1987 to 2018, landcover change of JPLYR was obtained using the random forest classification method. Linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to determine relationships between 16 hydrological variables regarding magnitude, duration, timing, variation, and vegetation area throughout different operational stages of the TGD. Results showed that the operation of the TGD has anticipated and elongated the dry seasons, with a consequential shortening of the flood seasons that now occur later in the year. The peak water level was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while the minimum water level remained unchanged throughout the study period. There was a 344% increase in vegetation coverage across the JPLYR from 1987 (0.677 km(2)) to 2018 (3.005 km(2)). The earlier beginning of dry season (BDS) was found to be most significant in affecting the increased vegetation area before and after the operation of TGD. The results provide an essential reference for assessing the potential influence of newly proposed dams in river-lake junctions and for optimizing future operations.

TI  - Detection of City Integration Processes in Rapidly Urbanizing Areas Based on Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Since China's reform and development commenced, in the context of rapid urbanization and coordinated regional development, Chinese cities with a close geographic proximity and social ties have gradually formed an integrated city development model. As a new phenomenon in China's urbanization process, existing research on China's integrated cities mainly focuses on typical case studies, and most research has been limited to literature reviews and theoretical analyses. The growing application of remote sensing technology in urbanization research in recent years has provided new opportunities for the analysis of city integration. Therefore, based on multi-spectral Landsat-8 and nighttime light images (SNPP/VIIRS, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), this paper selects four of the most representative integrated cities with different backgrounds in China to analyze the land-use conversion, plot light fluctuation, and light gravity center shift in the boundary zone between cities. The results show that (1) Guangfo has the highest level of integration and urban expansion is mainly concentrated in the south-central part of the boundary area; (2) Guanshen's level of integration is second to Guangfo's and is mainly concentrated in the west; (3) HuSu's integration is still in the initial stage and its increase in light intensity lags behind the expansion of building land during the study period; (4) although the light intensity and building land area increased significantly during the study period in Xixian, the overall development level of Xixian still lagged behind coastal cities due to the restriction of its geographical location. Our application results expand the data sources for integrated city research and the obtained results can potentially support decision-making and planning in the process of urban development.

TI  - Impact of state-led food localization on suburban districts' farmland use transformation: Greenhouse farming expansion in Nanjing city region, China
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - State-led efforts of food localization have been conducted across mainland China under the umbrella of Vegetable Basket Project since the end of the 1980s, with the purpose of addressing urban food security. Food localization as a counter movement to globalization has been extensively studied for its debatable role in promoting the sustainability of food systems in developed economies. Previous studies failed to recognize food localization initiatives driven by the state and its significant impact on suburban farmland use. To fill this gap, this study discusses the key features of state-led food localization with the case of Nanjing, China through examining governmental policy documents, local food production plans and the remote sensing data of greenhouse expansion. Furthermore, the impacts of a state-led food localization strategy on the transition of suburban farmland use, particularly on the expansion of greenhouses, have been investigated by employing the binary logistic regression model. We argue that state-led food localization has substantially promoted the expansion of greenhouse farming for the purpose of stabilizing a sufficient local food supply, particularly vegetables. It has also provided support through means such as subsidy, agriculture extension service and technology training to smallholders, including local and migrant farmers.

AB  - In this paper, the infrared cloud images from Fengyun series geostationary satellites and the best track data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA-BST) in 2015-2017 are used to investigate the effects of two multi-factor models, generalized linear model (GLM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, for tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation based on the deviation angle variance (DAV) technique. For comparison, the typical single-factor Sigmoid function model (SFM) with the map minimum value of DAV is also used to produce TC intensity estimation. Sensitivity experiments regarding the DAV calculation radius and different training data groups are conducted, and the estimation precision and optimum calculation radius for DAV in the western North Pacific (WNP) are analyzed. The results show that the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the single-factor SFM is 8.79-13.91 m s(-1) by using the individual years as test sets and the remaining two years as training sets with the optimum calculation radius of 550 km. However, after selecting and using the high-correlation multiple factors from the same test and training data, the RMSEs of GLM and LSTM models decrease to 5.93-8.68 and 4.99-7.00 m s(-1) respectively, with their own optimum calculation radii of 350 and 400 km. All the sensitivity experiments indicate that the SFM results are significantly influenced by the DAV calculation radius and characteristics of the training set data, while the results of multi-factor models appear more stable. Furthermore, the multi-factor models reduce the optimum radius within the process of DAV calculation and improve the precision of TC intensity estimation in the WNP, which can be chosen as an effective approach for TC intensity estimation in marine areas.

TI  - Landslide Characterization Applying Sentinel-1 Images and InSAR Technique: The Muyubao Landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a common natural hazard that causes casualties and unprecedented economic losses every year, especially in vulnerable developing countries. Considering the high cost of in-situ monitoring equipment and the sparse coverage of monitoring points, the Sentinel-1 images and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique were used to conduct landslide monitoring and analysis. The Muyubao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study. A total of 37 images from March 2016 to September 2017 were collected, and the displacement time series were extracted using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) small baselines subset method. The comparison to global positioning system monitoring results indicated that the InSAR processing of the Muyubao landslide was accurate and reliable. Combined with the field investigation, the deformation evolution and its response to triggering factors were analyzed. During this monitoring period, the creeping process of the Muyubao landslide showed obvious spatiotemporal deformation differences. The changes in the reservoir water level were the trigger of the Muyubao landslide, and its deformation mainly occurred during the fluctuation period and high-water level period of the reservoir.

TI  - The relationship between solar-induced fluorescence and gross primary productivity under different growth conditions: global analysis using satellite and biogeochemical model data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has become a milestone for estimating terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) at the global scale, and therefore it is important to understand how the relationship between SIF and GPP varies with environmental stresses and canopy structures. Our study investigated the impact of environmental conditions on the relationship between SIF and GPP at the global scale based on Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2) SIF and Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) GPP. GOME-2 SIF had strong correlations with gridded GPP data at instantaneous (R-2 = 0.618,p< 0.001) and daily timescales (R-2 = 0.621,p< 0.001) across the globe in eleven major biomes. Strong linear relationships were also consistently found for nine individual biomes at the daily timescale (R-2 = 0.512-0.839,p< 0.001) but were not found for evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF) (R-2 = 0.142,p< 0.001) and closed shrublands (R-2 = 0.395,p< 0.001). Generally, high coefficients of determination (R-2 > 0.8) were mainly distributed in southern Europe, southern and central Africa, northeastern and central China, North America, India and southern Russia, and the slope had a similar spatial distribution as the coefficients of determination. The relationship between SIF and GPP varied with air temperature (T-Air), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf area index (LAI). The slope of the SIF-GPP relationship had a maximal value when the air temperature ranged between approximately 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C, when the linear relationships between SIF and GPP were also the strongest. Our analysis based on the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model also indicated that the SIF-GPP relationship was complex and affected byT(Air), VPD and LAI. Our study can improve our understanding of the functional relationship between SIF and GPP and the information contained in remotely sensed SIF.

TI  - An Improved Temperature and Emissivity Separation Algorithm for the Advanced Himawari Imager
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an improved temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for simultaneously retrieving the land surface temperature and emissivity (LSTE) from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data, including a modified water vapor scaling (WVS) method and a calibrated empirical relationship over vegetated surfaces. The modified WVS algorithm is comparable to the original WVS algorithm in deriving the LSTE but expands the application scope of the original WVS algorithm. The calibrated empirical relationship improved the LSTE and retrieval accuracy over vegetated surfaces by up to 0.165 K and 0.004, respectively. Comprehensive validation and evaluation are conducted in this study. <italic>In situ</italic> measurements from three networks are collected for the temperature-based validation. The bias and RMSE are 0.19 and 2.93 K in the daytime, and 0.43 and 1.95 K in the nighttime, respectively. Radiance-based LST validation shows that the bias and RMSE are 0.25 and 1.88 K, respectively. In addition, the AHI LST is evaluated using the MYD11 LST over large inland lakes, and the bias and RMSE are 0.25 and 1.12 K, respectively. The AHI LST is also compared to the MYD21 LST. The spatial distributions of the two LSTs are similar, and the LST differences are mostly within 4 K. The bias of the AHI LST ranges from 0.57 to 0.36 K, and the RMSE ranges from 1.7 to 2.64 K. The retrieved AHI LSE is compared with the latest MYD21 LSE. The biases and RMSEs are smaller than 0.005 and 0.014, respectively, for the three AHI bands. The improved TES algorithm is proven to be capable of obtaining accurate LST and LSE from AHI data.

TI  - Reconstruction of time series leaf area index for improving wheat yield estimates at field scales by fusion of Sentinel-2,-3 and MODIS imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous time series crop growth monitoring during the main crop growth and development period at field scales is very important for crop management and yield estimation. For more than a decade, the time series leaf area index (LAI) products obtained from high temporal resolution satellites have been widely used in global crop growth monitoring. However, the spatial resolutions (250-1000 m) of these satellite sensors are too coarse for areas with complex and diverse land-use types, especially in China, which causes great uncertainties in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation results. In addition, due to the infiuence of clouds, optical remote sensing satellites cannot obtain continuous time series data at a given time step over the main crop growth and development period. In this paper, a method based on spatiotemporal data fusion and singular vector decomposition (SVD) is proposed to reconstruct field-scale time series LAI imagery over the main growth and development period of winter wheat. In this method, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Refiectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) is used to fuse the refiectance imagery of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, and a linear regression model between the LAI data retrieved from the fused refiectance data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data is established to reconstruct the continuous time series field-scale LAI imagery at a given time step. The accuracy of the reconstructed LAI and its capability for winter wheat yield estimation were tested on the Guanzhong Plain of China. The results indicate that (1) the ESTARFM model can fuse the refiectance bands from visible to shortwave infrared of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 on the Guanzhong Plain accurately within a 20-day interval of the winter wheat growth and development period; (2) the 4-day interval field-scale LAI imagery over the main winter wheat growth and development period can be accurately reconstructed based on the linear regression models between the fused LAI data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval MODIS LAI data; and (3) the yield map estimated from the reconstructed field-scale LAI shows more yield distribution details than MODIS yield estimation results. This study shows the feasibility of reconstructing continuous time series field-scale LAI data over the main winter wheat growth and development period on the Guanzhong Plain by combining the spatiotemporal data fusion model with SVD and the potential for estimating the winter wheat yield at field scales.

TI  - Development of a Machine Learning-Based Radiometric Bias Correction for NOAA's Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the development of a dynamic over-ocean radiometric bias correction for the Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS) which accounts for spatial, temporal, spectral, and angular dependence of the systematic differences between observed and forward model-simulated radiances. The dynamic bias correction, which utilizes a deep neural network approach, is designed to incorporate dependence on the atmospheric and surface conditions that impact forward model biases. The approach utilizes collocations of observed Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (SNPP/ATMS) radiances and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model analyses which are used as input to the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) forward model to develop training data of radiometric biases. Analysis of the neural network performance indicates that in many channels, the dynamic bias is able to reproduce realistically both the spatial patterns of the original bias and its probability distribution function. Furthermore, retrieval impact experiments on independent data show that, compared with the baseline static bias correction, using the dynamic bias correction can improve temperature and water vapor profile retrievals, particularly in regions with higher Cloud Liquid Water (CLW) amounts. Ocean surface emissivity retrievals are also improved, for example at 23.8 GHz, showing an increase in correlation from 0.59 to 0.67 and a reduction of standard deviation from 0.035 to 0.026.

TI  - Modeling the Effects of Global and Diffuse Radiation on Terrestrial Gross Primary Productivity in China Based on a Two-Leaf Light Use Efficiency Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation significantly affects terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the relationship between GPP and solar radiation is nonlinear because it is affected by diffuse radiation. Solar radiation has undergone a shift from darker to brighter values over the past 30 years in China. However, the effects on GPP of variation in solar radiation because of changes in diffuse radiation are unclear. In this study, national global radiation in conjunction with other meteorological data and remotely sensed data were used as input into a two-leaf light use efficiency model (TL-LUE) that simulated GPP separately for sunlit and shaded leaves for the period from 1981 to 2012. The results showed that the nationwide annual global radiation experienced a significant reduction (2.18 MJ m(-2) y(-1); p < 0.05) from 1981 to 2012, decreasing by 1.3% over this 32-year interval. However, the nationwide annual diffuse radiation increased significantly (p < 0.05). The reduction in global radiation from 1981 to 2012 decreased the average annual GPP of terrestrial ecosystems in China by 0.09 Pg C y(-1), whereas the gain in diffuse radiation from 1981 to 2012 increased the average annual GPP in China by about 50%. Therefore, the increase in canopy light use efficiency under higher diffuse radiation only partially offsets the loss of GPP caused by lower global radiation.

TI  - Dust Aerosol Retrieval Over the Oceans With the MODIS/VIIRS Dark Target Algorithm: 2. Nonspherical Dust Model
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dark-target (DT) aerosol algorithm retrieves spectral Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and other aerosol properties from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) reflectance observations. Over the ocean, the DT algorithm is known to contain scattering-angle-dependent biases in its retrievals of AOD, Angstrom Exponent (AE), and Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) for dust aerosols. Following a two-step strategy to improve the DT retrieval of dust over ocean, for which the first step is to identify dusty pixels (reported in "Part 1"), in this "Part 2," we report on construction of a new dust model lookup table (LUT) and the strategy for applying it within the existing DT algorithm. In particular, we evaluate different characterizations of dust optical properties from a variety of frameworks and databases, and compare them with the current DT retrieval assumptions. Substituting the standard operational LUT with a spheroid dust model with identified dusty pixels shows significant improvement when compared with collocated AERONET-identified dusty pixels. Specifically, the application of the new dust model to dusty pixels reduces their AOD bias from 0.06 to 0.02 while improving the fraction of retrievals within expected error from 64% to 82%. At the same time, the overall bias in AE is reduced from 0.13 to 0.06, and the scattering-angle-dependent AE bias is largely eliminated. In testing on two full months of data (April and July), the new retrieval will reduce the monthly mean AOD by up to 0.1 and 0.2 in the north Atlantic and Arabian seas, respectively. The average AE and FMF are also reduced in these dust heavy regions.

TI  - Dust Aerosol Retrieval Over the Oceans With the MODIS/VIIRS Dark-Target Algorithm: 1. Dust Detection
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To prepare for implementation of a new aerosol retrieval specifically designed for dust aerosol over ocean in the operational Dark-Target (DT) algorithms for the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite sensors, we focus on the challenge of detecting dust. We first survey the literature on existing dust detection algorithms and then develop an innovative algorithm that combines near-UV (deep blue), visible, and thermal infrared (TIR) wavelength spectral tests. The new detection algorithm is applied to Terra and Aqua MODIS granules and compared with other dust detection possibilities from existing MODIS products. Quantitative evaluation of the new dust detection algorithm is conducted using both a collocated AERONET-MODIS data set and collocated Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO)-MODIS data set. From comparison with both AERONET and CALIOP measurements, we estimate the new dust detection algorithm detects about 30% of weakly dusty pixels and more than 80% of heavily dusty pixels, with false detections in the range of 1-2%. The very low false detection rate is particularly noteworthy in comparison with existing literature. Compared with the dust flag currently available as part of the MODIS cloud mask product (MOD35/MYD35), and dust classification based on commonly used thresholds with aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE), the new dust detection algorithm finds more dusty pixels and fewer false detections.Plain Language Summary The Dark-Target (DT) aerosol retrieval is applied to measurements from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites to retrieve spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land and ocean. The algorithm generally provides high-quality retrievals within specified error bar. However, the DT-Ocean algorithm tends to provide biased retrievals of AOD, Angstrom exponent (AE), and fine mode fraction (FMF) for scenes containing dust aerosol of African or Asian origin. These biases are scattering angle dependent, which suggests errors in the assumed optical properties and phase function from the spherical dust models used. Therefore, we aim to improve the DT retrieval of dust over ocean with a two-step strategy. Here in Part 1, we describe Step 1 in which we develop an innovative dust detection algorithm that combines deep-blue, visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared wavelength spectral tests that are based on a survey of existing dust detection algorithms. Step 2 is described in Part 2, where we develop new nonspherical dust models and apply it to identified heavy dust pixels. Combing dust detection and nonspherical dust model has led to significant improvements in retrieved AOD, AE, and FMF in dust regions.

TI  - Integrating cross-sensor high spatial resolution satellite images to detect subtle forest vegetation change in the Purple Mountains, a national scenic spot in Nanjing, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the location and magnitude of vegetation change in scenic areas can guide the configuration of tourism facilities and the formulation of vegetation protection measures. High spatial resolution remote sensing images can be used to detect subtle vegetation changes. The major objective of this study was to map and quantify forest vegetation changes in a national scenic location, the Purple Mountains of Nanjing, China, using multi-temporal cross-sensor high spatial resolution satellite images to identify the main drivers of the vegetation changes and provide a reference for sustainable management. We used Quickbird images acquired in 2004, IKONOS images acquired in 2009, and WorldView2 images acquired in 2015. Four pixel-based direct change detection methods including the normalized difference vegetation index difference method, multi-index integrated change analysis (MIICA), principal component analysis, and spectral gradient difference analysis were compared in terms of their change detection performances. Subsequently, the best pixel-based detection method in conjunction with object-oriented image analysis was used to extract subtle forest vegetation changes. An accuracy assessment using the stratified random sampling points was conducted to evaluate the performance of the change detection results. The results showed that the MIICA method was the best pixel-based change detection method. And the object-oriented MIICA with an overall accuracy of 0.907 and a kappa coefficient of 0.846 was superior to the pixel-based MIICA. From 2004 to 2009, areas of vegetation gain mainly occurred around the periphery of the study area, while areas of vegetation loss were observed in the interior and along the boundary of the study area due to construction activities, which contributed to 79% of the total area of vegetation loss. During 2009-2015, the greening initiatives around the construction areas increased the forest vegetation coverage, accounting for 84% of the total area of vegetation gain. In spite of this, vegetation loss occurred in the interior of the Purple Mountains due to infrastructure development that caused conversion from vegetation to impervious areas. We recommend that: (1) a local multi-agency team inspect and assess law enforcement regarding natural resource utilization; and (2) strengthen environmental awareness education.

TI  - Cloud Computing Based on Computational Characteristics for Disaster Monitoring
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Resources related to remote-sensing data, computing, and models are scattered globally. The use of remote-sensing images for disaster-monitoring applications is data-intensive and involves complex algorithms. These characteristics make the timely and rapid processing of disaster-monitoring applications challenging and inefficient. Cloud computing provides a dynamically scalable resource over the Internet. The rapid development of cloud computing has led to an increase in the computational performance of data-intensive computing, providing powerful throughput by distributing computation across many distributed computers. However, the use of current cloud computing models in scientific applications using remote-sensing image data has been limited to a single image-processing algorithm rather than a well-established model and method. This poses problems for the development of complex disaster-monitoring applications on cloud platform architectures. For example, distributed computing strategies and remote-sensing image-processing algorithms are highly coupled and not reusable. The aims of this paper are to identify computational characteristics of various disaster-monitoring algorithms and classify them according to different computational characteristics; explore a reusable processing model based on the MapReduce programming model for disaster-monitoring applications; and then establish a programming model for each type of algorithm. This approach provides a simpler programming method for programmers to implement disaster-monitoring applications. Finally, some examples are given to explain the proposed method and test its performance.

TI  - CSR-Net: Camera Spectral Response Network for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification in Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become one of the most significant tasks in the field of hyperspectral analysis. However, classifying each pixel in HSI accurately is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality and limited training samples. In this paper, we present an HSI classification architecture called camera spectral response network (CSR-Net), which can learn the optimal camera spectral response (CSR) function for HSI classification problems and effectively reduce the spectral dimensions of HSI. Specifically, we design a convolutional layer to simulate the capturing process of cameras, which learns the optimal CSR function for HSI classification. Then, spectral and spatial features are further extracted by spectral and spatial attention modules. On one hand, the learned CSR can be implemented physically and directly used to capture scenes, which makes the image acquisition process more convenient. On the other hand, compared with ordinary HSIs, we only need images with far fewer bands, without sacrificing the classification precision and avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The experimental results of four popular public hyperspectral datasets show that our method, with only a few image bands, outperforms state-of-the-art HSI classification methods which utilize the full spectral bands of images.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Participating in sports is a great way to gain physical, psychological, and social benefits. However, it also carries the risk of injury. Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide, and in recent years, there have been concerns about potential vulnerabilities to head injuries.Objectives: To investigate soccer-related head injuries (SRHIs), using data from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) surveillance system. Specifically, we aim to compare characteristics of SRHI cases to all head injury cases within the eCHIRPP database.Methods: Descriptive analyses of emergency department (ED) injury surveillance data (2011 to 2017) for individuals aged 5 to 29 years from all participating eCHIRPP sites. Computation of proportionate injury ratios (PIR) comparing SRHIs to all head injuries reported to eCHIRPP, and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: A total of 3,970 SRHIs were reported to eCHIRPP. Injuries were from contact with another player, the ball, ground, goal-post, and other causes. Of the injuries caused by contact with the ball, 9% were from purposely directing the ball with the head (heading). A higher proportion of concussions (PIR=1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27 to 1.37) and minor closed head injuries (PIR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.26) were observed in soccer players. Higher proportions of head injuries occurred in organized soccer and soccer played outdoors. However, admission to the ED for a SRHI was rare (PIR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.55).Conclusions: Overall, elevated proportions of brain injuries were observed among soccer players, however, these injuries were unlikely to result in a hospital admission. Moreover, purposely heading the ball contributed to few ED visits.

TI  - R/UAStools::plotshpcreate: Create Multi-Polygon Shapefiles for Extraction of Research Plot Scale Agriculture Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural researchers are embracing remote sensing tools to phenotype and monitor agriculture crops. Specifically, large quantities of data are now being collected on small plot research studies using Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS, aka drones), ground systems, or other technologies but data processing and analysis lags behind. One major contributor to current data processing bottlenecks has been the lack of publicly available software tools tailored towards remote sensing of small plots and usability for researchers inexperienced in remote sensing. To address these needs we created plot shapefile maker (R/UAS::plotshpcreate): an open source R function which rapidly creates ESRI polygon shapefiles to the desired dimensions of individual agriculture research plots areas of interest and associates plot specific information. Plotshpcreate was developed to utilize inputs containing experimental design, field orientation, and plot dimensions for easily creating a multi-polygon shapefile of an entire small plot experiment. Output shapefiles are based on the user inputs geolocation of the research field ensuring accurate overlay of polygons often without manual user adjustment. The output shapefile is useful in GIS software to extract plot level data tracing back to the unique IDs of the experimental plots. Plotshpcreate is available on GitHub (https://github.com/andersst91/UAStools).

TI  - Earth Observations for Coastal Hazards Monitoring and International Services: A European Perspective
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to provide a tour of satellite missions for Coastal Hazards Monitoring, of relevant applications, as well as the downstream International Services such as the Copernicus Ocean and Land Monitoring Services. Earth observation (EO) satellite remote sensing provides global, repetitive and long-term observations with increasing resolution with every new generation of sensors. They permit the monitoring of small-scale signals like the ones impacting the coastal zone. EO missions are showcased in this article. Transforming the data products based on the satellite mission ground segment (usually called geophysical products, geophysical data records or so-called Level 2 products) into information useable by managers and decision-makers is done by downstream international services. This is an essential step to increase the uptake of satellite data for the benefit of society. Here, the type of services provided by, e.g., the European Copernicus Programme, is described along with examples of applications, such as monitoring storm surges.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with indocyanine green in cervical cancer patients undergoing open radical hysterectomy: a single-institution series
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To assess the rate of bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection with indocyanine green (ICG), to evaluate the sensitivity and the negative predictive value of cervical cancer patients undergoing open radical hysterectomy; to compare open versus minimally invasive SLN biopsy performance and to assess factors related to no/unilateral SLN mapping. Methods We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with FIGO 2018 stage IA1 with lymph-vascular space involvement to IIB and IIIC1p cervical carcinoma who underwent SLN mapping with ICG followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy between 05/2017 and 06/2020. Patients were divided according to surgical approach for statistical analysis. Results Eighty-five patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven (31.8%) underwent open and 58 (68.2%) underwent minimally invasive SLN mapping. No difference in any SLN mapping (laparotomy 92.6% and minimally invasive 91.4%) or in SLN bilateral detection (laparotomy 72.0% and minimally invasive 84.9%) (p = 0.850 andp = 0.222, respectively), in median number of SLNs mapped and retrieved (2 in both groups,p = 0.165) and in site of SLN mapping per hemi-pelvis (right side,p = 0273 and left side,p = 0.618) was evident between open and minimally invasive approach. Per-patient sensitivity of SLN biopsy in laparotomy was 83.3% (95% CI 35.9-99.6%) and the negative predictive value was 95.0% (95% CI 76.0-99.1%). No difference in per-patient sensitivity was noted between two approaches (p = 0.300). None of the analyzed variables was associated with no/unilateral SLN mapping. Conclusion The use of ICG to detect SLN in cervical cancer treated with open surgery allows a bilateral detection, sensitivity and negative predictive value comparable to minimally invasive surgery with potential advantages of ICG compared to other tracers.

TI  - "I Still Love My Hood": Passive and Strategic Aspects of Role Residual Among Former Gang Members
T2  - CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - One important aspect of gang disengagement that has been largely overlooked is the role of identity in the time following membership. Research has shown that former gang members often retain social and emotional ties with their former gang peers and may experience role ambiguity as a result. Despite this, there has been virtually no examination of role residual-the lingering aspects of one's former identity-that may exist among these individuals. Using life history interviews, the current study addresses this gap by examining role residual among a sample of 30 former gang members. A total of 25 participants (83%) identified three types of role residual-symbolic, demeanor, and worldview. In contrast to previous scholarship, role residual appeared to manifest as passive and strategic occurrences.

TI  - Satellite radar interferometry for assessing coseismic liquefaction in Portoviejo city, induced by the Mw 7.8 2016 Pedernales, Ecuador earthquake
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Portoviejo city, located in the central part of the Ecuadorian Pacific Coast (province of Manabi), was severely affected during the Pedernales Mw 7.8 earthquake of April 16, 2016, accompanied by coseismic liquefaction phenomena that induced processes of ground subsidence, lateral spreading, sinkhole, and sand boils. The present study proposes the detection and delimitation of the areas affected by the relief deformation, associated liquefaction processes, which occurred in the urban area of Portoviejo city and especially in the Zero Zone of greater destruction after the earthquake, through the application of Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) methodology, using Sentinel 1A satellite images, plus the support of geological-geotechnical data obtained from boreholes and standard penetration tests to evaluate the liquefaction potential of the layers of the subsoil based on the Potential Liquefaction Index, considering the seismic scenario ofa(max)0.5 g for the urban area and the Zero Zone. This procedure allowed the delimitation of areas of high seismic risk for the proper coordination and management of the construction and reconstruction processes in the city of Portoviejo and specifically in the Ground Zero.

TI  - Cultural worldviews and perceived risk of colon cancer and diabetes
T2  - HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Individuals with different cultural worldviews conceptualise risks in distinct ways, yet this work has not extended to personal illness risk perception. The purpose of this study was to 1) examine the relationships between two types of cultural worldviews (Hierarchy-Egalitarian; Individualism-Communitarianism) and perceived risk (perceived severity and susceptibility) for diabetes and colon cancer, 2) test whether health literacy modifies the above relationships, and 3) investigate whether trust in government health information functions as a putative mediator of the relations between cultural worldviews and disease perceived risk. We recruited (N = 600) participants from a nationally-representative Internet survey panel. Results were weighted so the findings are representative of the general United States population. People with a more hierarchical worldview expressed lower perceived susceptibility to developing both diabetes and colon cancer, and perceived these diseases to be less severe, relative to those with a less hierarchical (more egalitarian) worldview. There was no significant association between individualistic worldview and perceived risk. Health literacy modified the relationships between hierarchical worldview and perceived risk; the associations between hierarchical worldview and lower perceived severity were stronger for those with limited health literacy. We did not observe indirect effects of cultural worldviews on perceived risk through trust in health information from government sources. It may be useful to identify specifically tailored risk communication strategies for people with hierarchical and individualistic worldviews, especially those with limited health literacy, that emphasise their important cultural values. Further research examining cultural components of illness risk perceptions may enhance our understanding of risk-protective behaviours.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the inflow of water into the Thamalakane River had been predicted to alter snail population dynamics and influence the risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Maun. We determined the abundance of schistosome intermediate host snails along the Thamalakane River and evaluated the risk of schistosomiasis infection within Maun. A retrospective study utilised snail survey data previously collected from the Thamalakane River in Maun between June 2009 and July 2012. A total of 3 563 freshwater snails were collected from 10 sentinel sites along Thamalakane River.The snails collected wereBulinus globosus, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Lymnaea natalensis, Bellamya capillata,Pila occidentalisandLanistes ovum.Bulinus globosussnails were more abundant thanB. pfeifferi.None of the intermediate host snails (IHS) collected shed cercariae. The absence of infected IHS suggests that there was no active transmission of schistosomiasis during the study period. Furthermore, the presence ofB. globosusin the Thamalakane River suggests the potential risks ofSchistosoma haematobiuminfection when transmission conditions become conducive.

TI  - Spatial modeling to detect potential incidence zones of harmful algae blooms in Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are proliferations of microscopic algae associated with rapid production of biomass and/or toxic substances. This production's accumulation may cause massive death of marine life and affect human health with devastating economic repercussions. Monitoring HABs usually involves precise but costly field sampling and laboratory analyses. Satellite images and some of its derived products such as the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) have become cost-effective tools that have been proved useful for identification and monitor HABs at the Florida coast. In this study we used a spatially explicit modeling approach to identify potential incidence zones of HABs at Veracruz, Mexico. We relied on two sets of data: The first set consists of reports of HABs-related events published in both scientific journals and journalistic notes for the 2004 to 2015 period. The second set is comprised of FLH monthly products derived from the MODIS-Aqua satellite imagery for the same period. We conducted a retrospective analysis of monthly FLH values to analyze the spatial and temporal extent of potential HABs and compared them with published reports. It was noted that HABs events registered in literature for that period were identified with our spatial analysis, but most of the events identified as potential HABs with our analysis were not registered in literature. We conducted a "Hot- spots" analysis and identified four well-defined incidence zones for the entire coast of Veracruz state: the Port of Veracruz, Alvarado, Coatzacoalcos, and the Tamiahua Lagoon. Of the four zones, only the Port of Veracruz has been reported as an incidence zone for HABs events, while the other three have very few or no reports of HABs related events. We found this technique is accurate for HABs detection, as the analysis is based upon the local knowledge of harmful algae species.

TI  - Innate Immune Responses to Acute Viral Infection During Pregnancy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunological adaptations in pregnancy allow maternal tolerance of the semi-allogeneic fetus but also increase maternal susceptibility to infection. At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells-principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells-which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity. Despite extensive progress in unraveling the immunological adaptations of pregnancy, pregnant women remain particularly susceptible to certain acute viral infections and continue to experience mortality rates equivalent to those observed in pandemics several decades ago. Here, we focus specifically on the pregnancy-induced vulnerabilities in innate immunity that contribute to the disproportionately high maternal mortality observed in the following acute viral infections: Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever, hepatitis E, influenza, and novel coronavirus infections.

TI  - A tale of two cities: different urban heat mitigation efficacy with the same strategies
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent intensification of urban heat islands (UHIs) poses a great threat to public health, promoting studies on UHI mitigation strategies. However, the question about the transferability of a mitigation method from a specific city to another remains largely unanswered. This study compares common UHI mitigation strategies (including green roofs, cool roofs, and changing urban building structure) for two Chinese megacities suffered from summer heat stress: Xi'an with a semi-humid climate and Wuhan with a humid climate, through the use of the urbanized-high-resolution land data assimilation system (u-HRLDAS) modeling tool and remote-sensing data. The results reveal that (1) all UHI mitigation strategies work more efficiently for Xi'an than that for Wuhan, particularly for the strategy of modifying urban fraction and associated green roof fraction; (2) the difference in cooling efficacy between the two cities is insignificant during relatively cool periods. Under hot weather conditions, the best choice of UHI mitigation strategy depends on urban land use categories in Xi'an; and (3) the differences in UHI mitigation efficacy are likely caused by the differing regional climate. This study highlights the need to better understand the transferability of UHI mitigation strategies in different climate zones.

TI  - Sleep and Safety Decision-Making Among Truck Drivers
T2  - WORKPLACE HEALTH & SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Restorative sleep is essential for the level of cognitive performance required of truckers to drive safely. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to describe and explore sleep-related and safety decision-making among truck drivers. Methods: Flyers and snowball sampling were used to recruit truck drivers into the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine personal and professional influences on sleep and safety decision-making and preferences for receiving health information. Thematic analysis was conducted to generate descriptions of participants' experiences. Findings: The sample consisted of 10 White males with a mean of 22 years of truck-driving experience. Weather conditions and drowsiness were the most commonly described conditions that required sleep decision-making by the participants. Four themes impacting sleep- and safety-related decision-making emerged including sentinel events, evolving driver characteristics, relationships, and company-level factors. Conclusion/Application to Practice: Findings from this study suggest that there are both internal and external factors influencing sleep and safety decision-making among truck drivers. Personal relationships with important others, such as family members, and professional relationships with company dispatchers were important influences among participants. During encounters with truck drivers, occupational health nurses should assess sleep quality and quantity and review healthy sleep hygiene strategies with them and their family members, if they are available. Future larger studies are necessary to inform the development of interventions and company policies to promote healthy sleep among truck drivers.

TI  - Between Conspiracy Beliefs, Ingroup Bias, and System Justification: How People Use Defense Strategies to Cope With the Threat of COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current situation around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) portrays a threat to us in several ways: It imposes uncertainty and a lack of control and reminds us of our own mortality. People around the world have reacted to these threats in seemingly unrelated ways: From stockpiling yeast and toilet paper to favoring nationalist ideas or endorsing conspiratorial beliefs. According to theGeneral Process Model of Threat and Defense, the confrontation with a threat - a discrepant experience - makes humans react with both proximal and distal threat responses. While the proximal response manifests in behavioral inhibition that leads to heightened anxious arousal and vigilance, distal responses seek to lower behavioral inhibition and the associated state of anxiety and vigilance through engaging in distal defenses. In the present research, we propose that the reactions to COVID-19 may represent distal defense strategies to the pandemic and, therefore, can be explained and forecasted by the model. Thus, we hypothesized increased perceived COVID-19 threat to lead to a proximal threat response in the form of heightened behavioral inhibition. This, in return, should enhance the use of distal defenses (i.e., several ingroup biases, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs) overlapping with the reactions observed as a response to COVID-19. This hypothesized mediated effect of increased perceived COVID-19 threat on distal defenses was tested in two preregistered studies: In Study 1 (N= 358), results showed perceived COVID-19 threat to be related to behavioral inhibition and, in turn, to be associated with increased distal defenses (i.e., higher entitativity, control restoration motivation, passive party support). In Study 2 (N= 348), we manipulated COVID-19 threat salience and found results suggesting the distal defenses of ingroup entitativity, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs to be mediated by the proximal threat response. The results of the present research hint toward a common mechanism through which the seemingly unrelated reactions to COVID-19 can be explained. The results might help to predict future behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic and to design measures to counteract the detrimental effects of the pandemic.

TI  - Impact of Competition Versus Centralisation of Hospital Care on Process Quality: A Multilevel Analysis of Breast Cancer Surgery in France
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The implications of competition among hospitals on care quality have been the subject of considerable debate. On one hand, economic theory suggests that when prices are regulated, quality will be increased in competitive markets. On the other hand, hospital mergers have been justified by the need to exploit cost advantages, and by evidence that hospital volume and care quality are related. Methods: Based on patient-level data from two years (2005 and 2012) we track changes in market competition and treatment patterns in breast cancer surgery. We focus on technology adoption as a proxy of process quality and examine the likelihood of offering two innovative surgical procedures: immediate breast reconstruction (IBR), after mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We use an index of competition based on a multinomial logit model of hospital choice which is not subject to endogeneity bias, and estimate its impact on the propensity to receive IBR and SLNB by means of multilevel models taking into account both observable patient and hospital characteristics. Results: The likelihood of receiving these procedures is significantly higher in hospitals located in more competitive markets. Yet, hospital volume remains a significant indicator of quality, therefore benefits of competition appear to be sensitive to the estimates of the impact of volume on care process. In France, the centralisation policy, with minimum activity thresholds, have contributed to improving breast cancer treatment between 2005 and 2012. Conclusion: Finding the right balance between costs and benefits of market competition versus concentration of hospital care supply is complex. We find that close to monopolistic markets do not encourage innovation and quality in cancer treatment, but highly competitive markets where many hospitals have very low activity volumes are also problematic because hospital quality is positively linked to patient volume.

TI  - Evaluation of vegetation and evapotranspiration changes in Iran using satellite data and ground measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the water cycle on a global scale. Changes in leaf area index (LAI) influence ET changes. Satellite products are among the effective methods of estimating ET and LAI at local, regional, and global scales. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate three global remote sensing products of ETand two products of LAI and investigate their simultaneous changes in Iran over the 2000 to 2015 period. Selected ET products include Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS2.0), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ET (MODIS ET) products. LAI products include MODIS LAI and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI products. Validation using the 23 selected evaporation stations showed that among the three ET products MODIS has the best performance. Three ET products consistently show an increasing trend in annual ET over a large part of Iran. The mean annual trend values obtained from GLEAM3.0a, GLDAS, and MODIS ET products are 2.022, 1.359, and 0.429 mm/year, respectively. Among LAI products, GLASS had the highest correlation with the selected ET product (0.78). On average, the trend of intra-annual changes of LAI across Iran did not show a significant increasing or decreasing trend. Moreover, in areas where no significant change was observed in LAI, ET changes were unpredictable and depended on other factors. Overall, the results showed a relatively strong correlation between the selected ET and vegetation satellite products in the study area.

TI  - Remote sensing data fusion as a tool for biomass prediction in extensive grasslands invaded by <i>L. polyphyllus</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data fusion is a powerful tool to gain information of quantitative and qualitative vegetation properties on field level. The aim of this study was to develop prediction models from sensor data fusion for fresh and dry matter yield (FMY/DMY) in extensively managed grasslands with variable degree of invasion byL. polyphyllus. Therefore, a terrestrial 3d laser scanner (TLS) and a drone-based hyperspectral camera was used to collect high resolution 3d point clouds and hyperspectral aerial orthomosaics of four extremely heterogenous grasslands. From 3d point clouds multiple features (vegetation height, sum of voxel, point density and surface structure) were extracted and combined with hyperspectral data to develop an optimized biomass model from random forest regression algorithm to predict FMY and DMY (n(train) = 130, n(test) = 33). Models from hyperspectral data solitarily had the lowest prediction performance (FMY:R-2 = 0.61, nRMSE(r) = 17.14; DMY:R-2 = 0.59, nRMSE(r) = 19.37). Higher performance was gained by models derived from 3d laser data (FMY:R-2 = 0. 76, nRMSE(r) = 13.3; DMY:R-2 = 0. 74, nRMSE(r) = 15.1). A fusion of both sensor systems increased the FMY prediction performance up toR(2) = 0.8; nRMSE(r) = 12.02 and the DMY prediction performance toR(2) = 0.81 and nRMSE(r) = 12.06. The fusion of complementary sensor systems can increase the power to predict biomass yields of heterogenous and extensively managed grasslands. It is a novel alternative to labour-intensive, traditional biomass prediction methods and to remote sensing methods using only single sensor data.

TI  - Longitudinal study of land surface temperature (LST) using mono- and split-window algorithms and its relationship with NDVI and NDBI over selected metro cities of India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was designed to compare the pattern of land surface temperature (LST) over four metro cities of India (Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Kolkata) selected on a longitudinal basis in relation to the built-up and vegetation indices. Two different methods were employed for the retrieval of LST, i.e., mono-window algorithm (MWA) and split-window algorithm (SWA) on the Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) datasets, to analyze the spatial pattern of LST over selected cities in relation to normalized differential built-up index (NDBI) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). The result shows that the LST was high over the densely built areas while low over the densely vegetated areas. The highest LST, NDBI, and NDVI were found in Mumbai, while Kolkata records the lowest LST and NDVI. Furthermore, the spatial analysis of LST shows that the LST was high in central parts of all cities except in the case of Delhi where some peripheral areas also record high LST. The comparison from in situ LST (field observations) reveals that the SWA has higher accuracy in the retrieval of LST in maritime areas like Mumbai and Chennai because it reduces the atmospheric effects, while the MWA has higher accuracy for inland areas like Delhi. The spatial relationships of LST with NDVI and NDBI show that vegetation cover has more impact on LST in Delhi while low in Chennai and Mumbai, and the built-up surfaces have a higher impact on LST in Chennai and Mumbai than Kolkata and Delhi.

TI  - Impact of Land Cover Changes on the Soil and Water Quality of Greens Bayou Watershed
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid land use and land cover changes have a significant effect on ecology, environment, and human health in urban watersheds. With increase in frequency and intensity of the urban flooding events and repeated inundation of the neighborhoods, it is important to monitor the water and soil chemical characteristics in Greens Bayou Watershed (GBW) region. The objectives of this study were to (1) analyze the nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in water and soil samples along the Greens Bayou, (2) monitor the historical water quality data, and (3) identify and analyze land cover changes in the watershed using Landsat imagery. A total of 12 water and 12 soil samples, from four different sampling locations along the Greens Bayou, were collected during two seasons and processed for chemical analysis. Our water sample analysis revealed that the As, Cd, Pb, and Hg concentrations were higher in the fall compared with the summer and exceeded the critical limit. The soil analysis indicated that the Zn and Pb concentrations were higher in the fall over summer season and exceeded the background concentrations. Remote sensing analysis revealed that the impervious surface in the GBW increased by about 62.2% while the vegetative surface decreased by 30.6% during the period of 1984 to 2018. Environmental chemical analysis coupled with geospatial data demonstrated the impact of land cover changes on water and soil quality along the Greens Bayou by identifying areas vulnerable to change, which can be better managed to preserve the health of this urban watershed ecosystem.

TI  - The last strategy for re-dissemination of HPV vaccination in Japan while still under the suspension of the governmental recommendation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, the governmental recommnendation of HPV vaccine has been suspended since June 2013, due to media reports of alleged adverse vaccination events. Although evidence of effectiveness and safety of the HPV vaccine has been universally demonstrated, and the medical and academic organizations across Japan have requested the resumption of the government's recommendation, the Japanese government has not changed their official stance towards the HPV vaccine. Under the current suspension of the national government's recommendation, one local government Isumi City started sending a leaflet containing information of cervical cancer and HPV vaccine, but not recommendation for the vaccine, to the tagted girls born in the fiscal year (FY) 2003. The cumulative vaccination rate of them reached 10.07% (14/139), which was significantly higher than that (0.00%) for girls born in FY 2002 who did not receive such a leaflet (p < 0.001). We sincerely ask the national government to change their stance towards the HPV vaccine. We also strongly suggest that, in the meantime, local governments immediately begin to provide an appropriate information of cervical cancer and HPV vaccine to the targeted girls and their parents in a way similar to what Isumi City has now shown to be effective.

TI  - Registration errors among patients receiving blood transfusions: a national analysis from 2008 to 2017
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives The key first step for a safe blood transfusion is patient registration for identification and linking to past medical and transfusion history. In Canada, any deviation from standard operating procedures in transfusion is an error voluntarily reportable to a national database (Transfusion Error Surveillance System [TESS]). We used this database to characterize the subset of registration-related errors impacting transfusion care, including where, when and why the errors occurred, and to identify frequent high-risk errors. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on transfusion errors reported to TESS by sentinel reporting sites relating to patient registration and patient armbands, between 2008 and 2017. Free-text comments describing the error were coded to further categorize into common error types. The number of specimens received in the transfusion laboratory was used as the denominator for rates to allow for comparison between hospital sites. Results Five hundred and fifty-four registration errors were reported from 10 hospitals, for a global error rate of 5 center dot 4/10 000 samples (median 5 center dot 0 [interquartile range 3 center dot 7-7 center dot 0]). The potential severity was high in 85 center dot 7% of errors (n = 475). The patient experienced a consequence in 10 center dot 8% of errors (n = 60), but none resulted in patient harm. Rates varied widely and differed by nature across sites. Errors most commonly occurred in outpatient clinics or procedure units (n = 160, 28 center dot 8%) and in emergency departments (n = 130, 23 center dot 5%). Conclusion Registration errors affect transfusion at every step and location in the hospital and are commonly high risk. Further research into common root causes is warranted to identify preventative strategies.

TI  - Risk factors for complications and implant loss after prepectoral implant-based immediate breast reconstruction: medium-term outcomes in a prospective cohort
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Prepectoral implant-based breast reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix has become an increasingly popular option for selected patients. There are no randomized data to demonstrate short- or long-term outcomes. Cohort studies to date have demonstrated safety, but risk factors for complications are unknown. Methods This was a prospective cohort study of all patients undergoing prepectoral implant-based breast reconstruction between 2013 and 2019. Clinical factors and those related to reconstruction were analysed in relation to complications and implant loss using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results A total of 469 reconstructions were undertaken in 289 women; the majority of reconstructions were performed using a one-stage direct-to-implant technique with acellular dermal matrix. Median follow-up was 21 (range 2-71) months. Minor complications were seen after 11 center dot 2 per cent of reconstructions, major complications after 5 center dot 9 per cent, and the rate of implant loss by 3 months was 3 center dot 1 per cent. In the final multivariable model, sentinel node biopsy (odds ratio (OR) 5 center dot 06, 95 per cent c.i. 2 center dot 00 to 12 center dot 80), axillary clearance (OR 6 center dot 67, 1 center dot 17 to 37 center dot 94) and adjuvant radiotherapy (OR 7 center dot 11, 1 center dot 60 to 31 center dot 61) were independent risk factors for development of a major complication, and sentinel node biopsy (OR 4 center dot 32, 1 center dot 23 to 15 center dot 22) for implant loss. Conclusion Prepectoral implant-based breast reconstruction has acceptable medium-term results but careful patient selection is advised.

TI  - Reduction of Atmospheric Effects in Satellite Images During the COVID-19 Induced Lockdown
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of satellite images is affected due to the scattering and absorption of sunlight by atmospheric molecules and aerosols. Aerosols are small particles suspended in the atmosphere which affects the air quality. The concentration and characteristics of the atmospheric aerosols can vary from place to place. Aerosols are major constituents for the formation of haze and thus responsible for degradation in the satellite images. During the novel corona virus disease pandemic (COVID-19) countrywide lockdown in India, aerosols level significantly lowered in the north Indian cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain. In this paper, an analysis of image quality was done for Sentinel-2A/2B satellite images for different north Indian cities with respect to the impact of aerosols on image sharpness and surface reflectance values during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period. The image quality of the images was evaluated through the power spectrum, gradient, and reflectance values in the image. It was observed that the sharpness of the satellite images increased during the lockdown period due to the reduction in aerosols levels in the atmosphere. There was an increase in the power spectrum values from 5% (minimum) to 12% (maximum) in the blue band, 4% (minimum) to 10% (maximum) in the green band, and 1.7% (minimum) to 6% (maximum) in the red band in the satellite images of major cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain during the lockdown period. Since haze is an additive component in the images, thus it was also observed that surface reflectance values had decreased in visible bands for the features which have low surface reflectance values like water (30%), vegetation (21%) and barren land (17%) and surface reflectance values had increased in visible bands for the features which have high surface reflectance values like building (19%) during the lockdown period.

TI  - Urban Change Detection Analysis during 1978-2017 at Kolkata, India, using Multi-temporal Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focused on urban change detection and growth pattern analysis for the period of 1978-2017 at Kolkata using remote sensing data and GIS. The supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification technique is used to classify the multi-temporal satellite data in five classes which are urban built-up, open land, vegetation, agricultural land and water body. Results revealed that urban built-up area has progressively increased by about 21.17% (239.097 km(2)) during study period due to the new construction of roads, flyovers, settlements, etc. Other geographical features such as open land, vegetation, agricultural land and water body have gradually declined. To assess the accuracy of classification, 88.27%, 92.42%, 91.62%, 90.18% and 89.34% overall accuracy and 0.851, 0.904, 0.893, 0.875 and 0.866 Kappa statistic have been achieved for the images of 1978, 1988, 2000, 2010 and 2017, respectively. The degree of magnitude of urban sprawl has measured using the Shannon entropy method which demonstrates that the overall entropy values are progressively increased throughout the entire region that means the urban built-up is gradually extended in different positions. Moreover, entropy outcomes revealed that urban development occurred more in the northern and southern regions as compared with the other regions. From this study, four urban growth patterns have been found which are low density continuous, continuous linear, noncontiguous linear, and leapfrog development. The important patterns are continuous linear and noncontiguous linear because most of the urban development happened along the sides of the major roads or highways. Future prediction has been obtained using CA-Markov chain model and estimates that the urban built-up may be increased by about 56.18% (509.82 km(2)) in the year of 2031.

TI  - Scenario-based estimation of catchment carbon storage: linking multi-objective land allocation with InVEST model in a mixed agriculture-forest landscape
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study performed a scenario-based land allocation in a mixed agriculture-forest landscape in northern Iran to investigate how different land use policies contribute to changes in carbon storage. In pursuit of this goal, a temporal profile of the trade-off between the region's land use land cover (LULC) classes was produced using Landsat image of the year 2016. The weighted linear combination procedure was also used to map the suitability of land for agriculture, forest, urban, and rangeland based on ecological and socio-economic criteria. The suitability maps were analyzed through the Multi-Objective Land Allocation procedure under five scenarios with differing areas devoted to each LULC to generate different patterns of LULC distribution in the region. In addition, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model was used to estimate the potential of LULC classes in carbon storage. The amount of carbon storage differed significantly between the scenarios, ranging from 1.29 tons/ha/year when the majority of the land was devoted to agriculture (76% of the area) to 5.40 tons/ha/year when the landscape was dominated by forest (77% of the area). The extreme conditions presented in this research may not be as likely to occur, but opens a dialog between different stakeholders and informs of a probable trend of ecosystem service loss due to agricultural land expansion.

TI  - Research agenda for the Russian Far East and utilization of multi-platform comprehensive environmental observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Russian Far East is a region between China and the Russian Arctic with a diverse climatological, geophysical, oceanic, and economical characteristic. The southern region is located in the Far East monsoon sector, while the northern parts are affected by the Arctic Ocean and cold air masses penetrating far to the south. Growing economic activities and traffic connected to the China Belt and Road Initiative together with climate change are placing an increased pressure upon the Russian Far East environment. There is an urgent need to improve the capacity to measure the atmospheric and environmental pollution and analyze their sources and to quantify the relative roles of local and transported pollution emissions in the region. In the paper, we characterize the current environmental and socio-economical landscape of the Russian Far East and summarize the future climate scenarios and identify the key regional research questions. We discuss the research infrastructure concept, which is needed to answer the identified research questions. The integrated observations, filling in the critical observational gap at the Northern Eurasian context, are required to provide state-of-the-art observations and enable follow-up procedures that support local, regional, and global decision making in the environmental context.

TI  - Optimizing the Achievable Information Content Extraction from WorldView-4 Stereo Imagery
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, DigitalGlobe's third-generation commercial Earth observation satellite WorldView-4 (WV-4), which offered 31 cm spatial resolution for panchromatic imagery, was launched and was active up to January 2019. Together with WorldView-3, this is the highest ground resolution of civilian optical space-borne missions. In this study, the information content of WV-4 ' s pan-sharpened stereo imagery is comprehensively investigated by manual and automatic object extraction approaches in a study area with rolling urban topography. The potential of automatic extraction was maximised by a group of refinement methods supported by the normalised digital surface model (NDSM) generated from WV-4 stereo pair. The NDSM was used as an additional band in the segmentation for revealing the object height heterogeneity. The results demonstrated that our method increased the precision, completeness and overall quality of WV-4 automatic extraction up to 8.4% for the number of buildings and up to 3.4% for the road length.

TI  - Two centuries of water-level records at Lake George, NSW
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The year 2020 marked the 200th anniversary of European settlers first encountering the 'noble expanse of water' of Lake George in New South Wales. Since 1820, unofficial observations and official measurements of the lake's water-level have been recorded almost continuously by various individuals, research teams, government departments and private companies. The lake's recent hydrographic history has been characterised by periods of flood and drought, which correspond with the prevailing climate conditions of SE Australia. This is the longest water-level record of its sort in the Southern Hemisphere and hence of great scientific and historic value. Here, we have compiled all available historic water-level data for Lake George, referenced them to common datums and presented a methodology for continuing the record using satellite imagery in lieu of on-site measurements.

TI  - Dynamics of the Confluence of Malvinas and Brazil currents, and a southern Patagonian spawning ground, explain recruitment fluctuations of the main stock of<i>Illex argentinus</i>
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Argentine shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) sustains one of the world's largest squid fisheries. This squid presents strong interannual fluctuations in abundance, attributed to its semelparous life strategy coupled with environmental influences on recruitment. Several stocks have been identified, but the south patagonic stock (SPS) is the most abundant and the main support (ca. 80%) of the Argentine fishery. SPS spawns in autumn-winter, but there are controversies regarding the spawning ground location. We studied the relationship between the recruitment variability and oceanographic conditions to which eggs and paralarvae are exposed, considering two possible spawning ground locations: Patagonia and Southern Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that the SPS recruitment variability could be controlled by oceanographic fluctuations related to the transport of the egg masses spawned on each of the two grounds, to their retention on the continental shelf and to the attainment of the thermal habitat required for eggs hatching. We used a 24- years long time series (1993-2017) of catch per unit effort of the squid fishery, and a shorter stock-assessment series as recruitment proxies; and satellite data of SST and of geostrophic velocities derived from sea surface height. This information was employed to model the advection of the squid egg masses along the external shelf and slope and to estimate the annual recruitment success. Results show that if spawning occurs in Patagonia, 52% of the recruitment variability could be explained. On the other hand, if spawning occurs in southern Brazil, it does not result in successful recruitments for the SPS.

TI  - Risk of Stroke and Bleeding in Atrial Fibrillation Treated with Apixaban Compared with Warfarin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A previous FDA study reported a favorable benefit risk for apixaban compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in older non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients (>= 65 years). However, it remains unclear whether this favorable benefit risk persists in other populations including younger users. We examined if a similar benefit risk was observed in the Sentinel System and if it varied by age group. Objective To examine the risk of ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in apixaban users compared with warfarin users in Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD). Design and Participants A retrospective new user cohort study was conducted among patients, 21 years and older initiating apixaban and warfarin for NVAF, between December 28, 2012, and June 30, 2018, in the SDD. Main Measures Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome (ischemic stroke, GI bleeding, and ICH) in propensity score matched apixaban users compared with the warfarin users. Subgroup analyses by age (21-64, 65-74, and 75+ years) were conducted. Key Results After matching, 55.3% and 58.4% (n = 55,038) of the apixaban and warfarin users were included in the main analysis. GI bleeding was the most common outcome. The HR (95% CI) for GI bleeding, ICH, and ischemic stroke in apixaban users compared with warfarin users were 0.57 (0.50-0.66), 0.53 (0.40-0.70), and 0.56 (0.45-0.71) respectively. The reduced risk of these outcomes in apixaban compared with warfarin users persisted across age groups. Conclusion In NVAF patients of all ages initiating either apixaban or warfarin for stroke prevention in the Sentinel System, apixaban was associated with a decreased risk of GI bleeding, ICH, and ischemic stroke compared with warfarin. Among patients less than 65 years of age, apixaban use was associated with a decreased risk of GI bleeding and ischemic stroke.

TI  - Toward Sustained Monitoring of Subsidence at the Coast Using InSAR and GPS: An Application in Hampton Roads, Virginia
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hampton Roads is among the regions along the U.S. Atlantic Coast experiencing high rates of relative sea level rise. Partly to mitigate subsidence from aquifer compaction, Hampton Roads is injecting treated wastewater into the underlying aquifer. However, the GPS (Global Positioning System) station spacing (similar to 30 km) is too coarse to capture the spatial variability of subsidence and potential uplift from the injection. We present a cost-effective workflow for generating an InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and GPS combined displacement product. We leverage a live, open-access archive of InSAR products generated from Sentinel-1 data. We find an overall subsidence rate of-3.6 +/- 2.3 mm/year with considerable spatial variability. The effects of groundwater injection are currently below detection. The workflow presented here is an asset for sustained monitoring of the injection effort and regional subsidence that is applicable along the U.S. coasts for assisting in mitigation and adaptation of relative sea level rise.Plain Language Summary Hampton Roads in coastal Virginia is among the regions experiencing high rates of relative sea level rise. This rate exceeds the global average primarily due to ongoing land subsidence. In part to reduce this subsidence, Hampton Roads has begun injecting treated wastewater into the underlying aquifer. However, the rate of subsidence and potential uplift from the injection is not uniform but varies spatially, such that the existing network of sensors is unsuitable for monitoring. Here we implement a cost-effective approach for ongoing monitoring that leverages publicly available data products derived from the Sentinel-1 satellite. Overall, we find that Hampton Roads is sinking at a rate of -3.6 +/- 2.3 mm/year, with considerable differences at the neighborhood scale. The effects of the injection cannot yet be seen but will have a larger impact at the surface as more wastewater is injected at full-scale facilities later this year. The workflow presented here is a valuable asset for sustained monitoring of the injection effort and regional subsidence that can be applied along the U.S. coasts for assisting in mitigation and adaptation of relative sea level rise.

TI  - Conjugation of AMUL and ISRO: Development of Feed and Fodder for Dairy Industries
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feed and fodder comprises about 65% of the cost of milk production of a dairy industry. It is a crucial input for enhancing the milk production. To address the issue of fodder availability at first, its assessment is required. Thus, we have implemented remote sensing technique for fodder crop assessment at state level to create a baseline for fodder crop availability for dairy managers to plan for its procurement during deficit and for better management purposes during its excess. We have devised a technique for remote sensing-based fodder crop assessment based on spectral pattern of growth, i.e. normalised difference vegetation index profile and land surface wetness index profile of series of IRS LISS-III satellite data taken during the crop growth cycle for a hybrid method of crop classification. Second objective to address the issue of mitigating the deficit of fodder crops, we have demonstrated the satellite derived intersection of probable high soil wetness area and available current fallows during a crop growing season which can be utilised for growing fodder crops. For macro-level planning in a state for developing new fodder-growing areas, we have demonstrated the availability of soil wetness factor from SMAP data. Fallow land available between two cropping seasons can be identified through remote sensing for growing short duration fast growing fodder crops. This project has been a demonstration project for AMUL in Gujarat to implement it subsequently at national level.

TI  - Estimation of hydraulic conductivity in fractured crystalline aquifers using remote sensing and field data analyses: An example from Wadi Nasab area, South Sinai, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractured crystalline aquifer is considered as the main source of water supply in most of the arid and semi-arid regions. Fractures play an essential role as pathways through which groundwater flows from high catchments to supply the productive wells in lowlands. The hydraulic conductivity measurements for highly fractured crystalline aquifers are a must for optimal management of groundwater extraction from these aquifers. The current work aims at estimating the hydraulic conductivity of the crystalline aquifer by using an unconventional approach based entirely on the processing of remotely-sensed lineament data and field observations. Extracted lineaments at four sites near the productive wells along Wadi Nasab area (WNA) were traced from Landsat (ETM+7) and other ancillary geological data by using image processing and GIS tools. Hence, four discrete fracture networks (DFN) were designed and practiced for the selected test sites to model the groundwater flow through the fracture system in order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the investigated crystalline aquifer. The achieved results indicated that the hydraulic conductivity of fractured basement aquifer of WNA varied between 2.3 x 10(-7)and 6.1 x 10(-7)m/s. The estimated hydraulic conductivity values are close to the values of previous field infiltration tests in the nearby area at Sinai. The previously estimated infiltration rates (expressing the vertical hydraulic conductivity) on the fractured crystalline outcrops ranged between 2.6 x 10(-6)and 6.5 x 10(-7)m/s, which are concordant with achieved results. Moreover, the achieved values match the previously published values of hydraulic conductivity for similar crystalline aquifers around the world, reflecting the high validity of the used unconventional, low-cost approach to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of fractured crystalline aquifers. The designed approach can be potentially practiced on similar basins in Sinai peninsula and other comparable basins having similar geological and climatic environments around the world.

TI  - Near-real time forest change detection using PlanetScope imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To combat global deforestation, monitoring forest disturbances at sub-annual scales is a key challenge. For this purpose, the new Planetscope nano-satellite constellation is a game changer, with a revisit time of 1 day and a pixel size of 3-m. We present a near-real time forest disturbance alert system based on PlanetScope imagery: the Thresholding Rewards and Penances algorithm (TRP). It produces a new forest change map as soon as a new PlanetScope image is acquired. To calibrate and validate TRP, a reference set was constructed as a complete census of five randomly selected study areas in Tuscany, Italy. We processed 572 PlanetScope images acquired between 1 May 2018 and 5 July 2019. TRP was used to construct forest change maps during the study period for which the final user's accuracy was 86% and the final producer's accuracy was 92%. In addition, we estimated the forest change area using an unbiased stratified estimator that can be used with a small sample of reference data. The 95% confidence interval for the sample-based estimate of 56.89 ha included the census-based area estimate of 56.19 ha.

TI  - Periclavicular Lymph Node Activation Maintains the Lymphatic Circulation of Upper Extremity Following Breast Cancer Surgery with Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds:Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can cause breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). However, ALND does not always produce lymphedema to the breast cancer survivors. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the correlation between the finding of lymphoscintigraphy and lymphedema in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with ALND. Methods and Results:Patients with BCRL (n = 73, mean age: 53.92 +/- 11.13 years) after full ALND (levels I, II, and III) were retrospectively included in this study. All patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy and according to the findings of the imaging, patients were divided into three groups: negative group, periclavicular lymph nodes (P-LN) activation, and axillary lymph nodes (A-LN) activation. According to the extent of radiation therapy, groups were classified as the following: no radiation group (None), breast radiation group (BI), and breast irradiation in addition to P-LN (BI+PC). The percentage difference in the upper extremities was used as the marker of severity of lymphedema. The subjects in the negative group, P-LN, and A-LN were 34 (46.6%), 33 (45.2%), and 6 (8.2%) patients, respectively. The findings of lymphangiography showed statistically significant relationship with the severity of lymphedema. The extent of radiation therapy did not have statistically significant relationship. Despite ALND, 53.4% patients had active L/N capable of removing the upper limb lymphatic fluids and 45.2% patients showed activation of collateral formation of lymphatic circulation after ALND. Conclusion:The collateral lymphatic formation was provoked after breast cancer operation with ALND, which decreased the severity of lymphedema in breast cancer survivors.

TI  - <i>Bacillus velezensis</i>DP-2 isolated from Douchi and its application in soybean meal fermentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Soybean meal (SBM) is the most common protein source used in the poultry and livestock industries. It has high-quality protein, an excellent amino acid (AA) profile, and positive isoflavone properties. However, the antigen proteins in SBM are unsuitable for young animals. The objective of this study was to identify aBacillusstrain that can degrade soybean antigen proteins, and to evaluate the feasibility of its application in SBM fermentation. RESULTS Bacillus velezensisDP-2 was isolated from Douchi, a fermented Chinese food. It degraded 96.14% and 66.51% of glycinin and beta-conglycinin, and increased the trichloroacetic acid-soluble protein (TCA-N) content by 5.46 times in the SBM medium. DP-2 could secrete alkaline protease and neutral protease, with productivities of 5.85 and 5.99 U mL(-1). It had broad-spectrum, antibacterial activities againstRhizopus nigricansHR,Fusarium oxysporumACCC37404,Penicillium digitatumSQ2,Aspergillus flavusC1,Aspergillus nigerACCC30005,Trichoderma virideYZ1,Candida tropicalisCICC1630, andSalmonellasp. ZY.For SBM fermentation, the optimal inoculum rate, temperature, and fermentation time of DP-2 were 2.21 x 10(7)CFU g(-1), 37 degrees C, and 48 h, respectively. The fermented soybean meal (FSBM) was cream-colored and glutinous. Its crude protein (CP), soluble protein, and TCA-N content were improved by 13.45%, 12.53%, and 6.37 times, respectively. The glycinin and beta-conglycinin content were reduced by 78.00% and 43.07%, respectively, compared with raw SBM. CONCLUSIONS Bacillus velezensisDP-2 has potential as a starter culture for SBM fermentation. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Ischemic Stroke With Cerebral Protection System During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
T2  - JACC-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to evaluate in-hospital outcomes with use of the Sentinel cerebral protection system (CPS) in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).BACKGROUND The role of the Sentinel CPS in preventing clinical ischemic stroke has been controversial.METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from the last three quarters of 2017, after the approval of the Sentinel CPS device, was queried to identify hospitalizations for TAVR. A 1:2 propensity score-matched analysis to compare in-hospital outcomes with versus without use of the CPS. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic strokes.RESULTS A total of 36,220 weighted discharges of patients who underwent TAVR (525 with the CPS and 35,695 without) were identified. The overall percentages of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively. After propensity score matching (525 CPS, 1,050 no CPS), the risk for ischemic stroke was tower with use of the CPS (1 % vs. 3.8%, odd ratio [OR]: 0.243 (95% confidence interval: 0.095 to 0.619); p = 0.003). The cost of the index hospitalization was higher with use of the CPS ($47,783 vs. $44,578; p = 0.002). In multivariate regression analysis, use of the CPS was independently associated with a lower risk for ischemic stroke (OR: 0.380; 95% confidence interval: 0.157 to 0.992; p = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS Use of the Sentinel CPS in patients undergoing TAVR is associated with a tower incidence of ischemic stroke and in-hospital mortality, without an increased risk for procedural complications but with an increased cost of the index hospitalization.

TI  - On the performance of fusion based planet-scope and Sentinel-2 data for crop classification using inception inspired deep convolutional neural network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research work aims to develop a deep learning-based crop classification framework for remotely sensed time series data.Tobaccois a major revenue generating crop of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan, with over 90% of the country'sTobaccoproduction. In order to analyze the performance of the developed classification framework, a pilot sub-region named Yar Hussain is selected for experimentation work. Yar Hussain is a tehsil of district Swabi, within KP province of Pakistan, having highest contribution to the gross production of the KPTobaccocrop. KP generally consists of a diverse crop land with different varieties of vegetation, having similar phenology which makes crop classification a challenging task. In this study, a temporal convolutional neural network (TempCNNs) model is implemented for crop classification, while considering remotely sensed imagery of the selected pilot region with specific focus on theTobaccocrop. In order to improve the performance of the proposed classification framework, instead of using the prevailing concept of utilizing a single satellite imagery, both Sentinel-2 and Planet-Scope imageries are stacked together to assist in providing more diverse features to the proposed classification framework. Furthermore, instead of using a single date satellite imagery, multiple satellite imageries with respect to the phenological cycle ofTobaccocrop are temporally stacked together which resulted in a higher temporal resolution of the employed satellite imagery. The developed framework is trained using the ground truth data. The final output is obtained as an outcome of the SoftMax function of the developed model in the form of probabilistic values, for the classification of the selected classes. The proposed deep learning-based crop classification framework, while utilizing multi-satellite temporally stacked imagery resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 98.15%. Furthermore, as the developed classification framework evolved with specific focus onTobaccocrop, it resulted in bestTobaccocrop classification accuracy of 99%.

TI  - Power politics: Armed non-state actors and the capture of public electricity in post-invasion Baghdad
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars observe that armed non-state actors (NSAs) often provide social services to reinforce their popular support and legitimacy as guarantors of local order. On the other hand, NSAs usually face funding constraints that make the independent provision of distributive goods difficult. This article argues that armed NSAs employ an alternative, more cost-effective tactic to deliver services. It argues that militant groups can leverage their armed capacity to capture control of and monopolize access to state-sponsored services. As an example, it documents the capture of public electricity infrastructure that took place in post-invasion Baghdad under the Sadrist Movement, an armed group formed shortly after the ouster of the Ba'athist state. Using local-level information about the location of Sadrist offices and remote sensing data, it estimates that Sadrist-affiliated neighborhoods in Baghdad saw an average increase in access to electricity between 2003 and 2006 that was significantly greater than in other areas of the city. The article concludes by addressing threats to inference, showing that these differences are not alternatively explained by demographic differences or changes therein due to ongoing conflict. It also discusses how this NSA strategy might contribute to an equilibrium of low state legitimacy and weak capacity in fragile contexts like that of post-2003 Iraq.

TI  - Digital stories for transition: co-constructing an evidence base in the early years with autistic children, families and practitioners
T2  - EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns have been raised about the quality of practice-focused research in education generally and in early years education specifically. Chris Pascal and Tony Bertram argue that a shift in worldview is needed to improve the robustness and overall quality of participatory research in the early years and proposed a "praxeological framework" for research comprising praxis, power, values, and methodology. This paper provides an example of how this praxeological framework was applied within an existing research-practice partnership focusing on autism education in the early years. We used a "non-orthodox" Digital Storytelling methodology to co-construct knowledge between researchers, practitioners, children and families about educational transitions. Our co-construction of knowledge involved the embodied knowledge of children and the exemplary (practical) knowledge of families and practitioners, leading to new insights into educational practices. In adopting a knowledge co-creation approach from the start, we established a powerful pathway to impact through which our research is already making a difference to practice. We propose that pathway to impact is an important element that could be made more explicit within a praxeological framing of research.

TI  - Impact of Forest Fire Frequency on Tree Diversity and Species Regeneration in Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest of Panna Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study analyzes the tree diversity and regeneration status of species between repeated forest fires and unburned areas of the tropical dry deciduous forest of Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR), Madhya Pradesh, Central India. Fire frequency maps were prepared with the help of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images, and the study area was classified into seven fire frequency classes (B1 to B7) and one control class (B0). Five plots were laid in every fire class including the control. A total of 45 tree species belonging to 33 genera and 20 families were recorded during the study period and of these, 44, 26, and 25 species were recorded in the three-growth stages: trees, saplings, and seedlings, respectively. Of the 7873 individuals recorded, 2667, 1243, and 3963 were seedlings, saplings, and trees, respectively. Our results showed that tree species diversity was higher at moderate fire frequencies than controls, but decreased with increasing fire frequency classes. Regeneration of species was significantly different among all fire frequency classes. Certain fire-tolerant species were increasingly dominant with increasing fire frequency classes. With fires left to continue unabated, the dry deciduous forest of the Central Indian region could have lower tree diversity in the future.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy in the Time of COVID-19: Effect of Molybdenum-99 Shortage on Feasibility of Sentinel Node Mapping
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:In the current study, we reported our experience on sentinel node mapping of breast cancer patients during the extreme shortage of Mo99-Tc99m generators using Tc-99m phytate. Methods and Results:During the period from March 7, 2019, to April 18, 2020, due to disruption of molybdenum supply chain, we used low specific activity Tc-99m pertechnetate elute (0.5-2 mCi of(99m)TcO(4)in 5 mL) for each kit preparation. Two or three intradermal periareolar injections were done for each patient (0.02-0.1 mCi/0.2 mL for each injection). Immediately following injection, dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was done. Surgery was done the same day of injection and the axillary sentinel node was sought using a gamma probe. Overall, 35 patients were included in the study. The specific activity of the Tc-99m elute (in 5 mL) used for kit preparation was 2 mCi/10 mg in four, 1.5 mCi/10 mg in eight, 1.25 mCi/10 mg in eight, 1 mCi/10 mg in three, 0.75 mCi/10 mg in five, and 0.5 mCi/10 mg of(99m)Tc-Phytate in seven patients. For the first four groups of patients, we used two 0.2 mL injections, while in the latter two groups, three 0.2 mL injections were used. At least one sentinel node was detected in all patients but three in whom axilla was involved. Conclusion:Sentinel node biopsy can be achieved with low specific activity of Tc-99m elute at the time of Mo99-Tc-99m generator shortage. If special personal protection is used, sentinel node mapping can be done in nuclear medicine departments with excellent results despite the COVID-19 pandemic and disruption of generator shipment.

TI  - Remembering IRS-1C Mission: The "Game Changer" of Indian Earth Observation Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - India's second-generation earth observation satellite series started with the launch of IRS-1C in December 1995, twenty-five years ago. It is considered to be a "game changer" for Indian earth observation program. With a 5.8 m panchromatic (PAN) camera onboard, IRS-1C became the highest spatial resolution civilian operational satellite at the time of launch and maintained this status till the launch of IKONOS satellite in 1999. IRS-1C also had a unique feature of 3-tier imaging geometry that drew the attention of global remote sensing user community. Other than the PAN camera, the 23.5 m multispectral camera including a shortwave infrared band and the high repetitive coarse-resolution two-band camera facilitated many newer applications and scientific investigations. Commercially, it was one of the most successful missions of the IRS program. The lessons learnt from this mission were even more significant, as these have led to many dedicated theme-missions subsequently.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Migration of the River Ganga in Middle Ganga Plane: Application of Remote Sensing and GIS Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of channel migration becomes crucial to a populace living in or near the floodplain or to government organizations involved in planning or upholding the infrastructure within or nearby the floodplains. Spatiotemporal migration of the River Ganga in the Middle Ganga Plain for about forty years (1972-2018) was measured using Landsat images, coupled with extensive ground checks. Assessment of satellite images of 1972, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018 reveals the Ganga River migrated within its valley, demonstrating significant changes in the channel geometry on a decadal scale. Heavy rains promote the enhancement of the sediment load in the channel triggering a further increase in the sinuosity index. However, the overall sinuous nature of the Ganga River channel is mainly fault-controlled. The variable lateral migration of the channel seems related to heavy rains and reactivation of chute channels within the river valleys. The lateral movement of the river is one of the critical factor responsible for the failure of the older floodplain (bank) within the valley by the undercutting process.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical staging remains the standard primary treatment of endometrial cancer. Lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor which helps in deciding adjuvant treatment. Extensive lymphadenectomy is associated with increased incidence of morbidity. The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical staging is still controversial especially in early stage disease. The surgico-pathological pattern of 155 patients with apparently stage 1 cancer endometrium who had undergone pelvic alone or pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection and its correlation to the grade of the tumour, myometrial infiltration and presence of peritoneal disease and incidence of peri-operative morbidity are analysed and described.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis of the dark spectrum fitting atmospheric correction for metre- and decametre-scale satellite imagery using autonomous hyperspectral radiometry
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of the dark spectrum fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction algorithm is evaluated using matchups between metre- and decametre-scale satellite imagery as processed with ACOLITE and measurements from autonomous PANTHYR hyperspectral radiometer systems deployed in the Adriatic and North Sea. Imagery from the operational land imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 A and B, and the PlanetScope CubeSat constellation was processed for both sites using a fixed atmospheric path reflectance in a small region of interest around the system's deployment location, using a number of processing settings, including a new sky reflectance correction. The mean absolute relative differences (MARD) between in situ and satellite measured reflectances reach <20% in the Blue and 11% in the Green bands around 490 and 560 nm for the best performing configuration for MSI and OLI. Higher relative errors are found fig the shortest Blue bands around 440 nm (30-100% MARD), and in the Red-Edge and near-infrared bands (35-100% MARD), largely influenced by the lower absolute data range in the observations. Root mean squared differences (RMSD) increase from 0.005 in the NM to about 0.015-0.020 in the Blue band, consistent with increasing atmospheric path reflectance. Validation of the Red-Edge and NW bands on Sentinel-2 is presented, as well as for the first time, the Panchromatic band (17-26% MARD) on Landsat 8, and the derived Orange contra-band (8-33% MARD for waters in the algorithm domain, and around 40-80% MARD overall). For Sentinel-2, excluding the SWIR bands from the DSF gave better performances, likely due to calibration issues of MSI at longer wavelengths. Excluding the SWIR on Landsat 8 gave good performance as well, indicating robustness of the DSF to the available band set. The DSF performance was found to be rather insensitive to (1) the wavelength spacing in the lookup tables used tbr the atmospheric correction, (2) the use of default or ancillary information on gas concentration and atmospheric pressure, and (3) the size of the ROI over which the path reflectance is estimated. The performance of the PlanetScope constellation is found to be similar to previously published results, with the standard DSF giving the best results in the visible bands in terms of MARD (24-40% overall, and 18-29% for the turbid site). The new sky reflectance correction gave mixed results, although it reduced the mean biases for certain configurations and improved results for the processing excluding the SWIR bands, giving lower RMSD and MARD especially at longer wavelengths (>600 nm). The results presented in this article should serve as guidelines for general use of ACOLITE and the DSF.

TI  - Onboard absolute radiometric calibration and validation of the satellite calibration spectrometer on HY-1C
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the reference radiometric calibration standard of sensors on the Haiyang-1C (HY-1C) satellite platform, the satellite calibration spectrometer (SCS) is equipped with an onboard calibration system composed of double solar diffusers and an erbium-doped diffuser to monitor the postlaunch radiometric response change. Herein, through onboard calibration data analysis, the calibration diffuser performance remains stable without degradation, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra is adopted as a reference to repeatedly verify onboard radiometric calibration results by selecting different dates and reflectance scenes. The SCS equivalent reflectance is obtained by combining the mean digital number (DN) of the SCS crossing area image with the radiometric calibration coefficient. The spectral reflectance is obtained via interpolation and iteration, which is adopted as the actual MODIS incident pupil spectral reflectance because the small imaging time interval can be ignored and almost vertically observed, and it is convoluted with the MODIS spectral response function to obtain the predicted equivalent reflectance. Validation is completed by comparing the predicted MODIS equivalent reflectance to the measured value based on the onboard calibration coefficient. The results show that (1) the difference between the measured and predicted MODIS band equivalent reflectance is between -0.00466 and 0.0039, and (2) the percentage difference between the measured and predicted MODIS band equivalent reflectance ranges from 4.17% and 1.24%, indicating that the calibration system carried on HY-1C can perform high-precision SCS radiometric calibration, meeting the cross-calibration accuracy requirements of other loads on the same platform.

TI  - Assessment of Uncertainty Sources in Snow Cover Simulation in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays an important role in Asian climate. State-of-the-art models, however, show significant simulation biases. In this study, we assess the main uncertainty associated with model physics in snow cover modeling over the TP using ground-based observations and high-resolution snow cover satellite products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FengYun-3B (FY3B). We first conducted 10-km simulations using the Noah with multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model by optimizing physics-scheme options, which reduces 8.2% absolute bias of annual snow cover fraction (SCF) compared with the default model settings. Then, five SCF parameterizations in Noah-MP were optimized and assessed, with three of them further reducing the annual SCF biases from around 15% to less than 2%. Thus, optimizing SCF parameterizations appears to be more important than optimizing physics-scheme options in reducing the uncertainty of snow modeling. As a result of improved SCF, the positive bias of simulated surface albedo decreases significantly compared to the GLASS albedo data, particularly in high-elevation regions. This substantially enhances the absorbed solar radiation and further reduces the annual mean biases of ground temperature from -3.5 to -0.8 degrees C and snow depth from 4.2 to 0.2 mm. However, the optimized model still overestimates SCF in the western TP and underestimates SCF in the eastern TP. Further analysis using a higher-resolution (4 km) simulation driven by topographically adjusted air temperature shows slight improvement, suggesting a rather limited contribution of the finer-scale land surface characteristics to SCF uncertainty.

TI  - Surgical treatment of gallbladder cancer: An eight-year experience in a single center
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common biliary malignancy and has the worst prognosis, but aggressive surgeries [e.g., resection of the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD), major hepatectomy and lymph node (LN) dissection] may improve long-term survival. GBC may be suspected preoperatively, identified intraoperatively, or discovered incidentally on histopathology.AIM To present our data together with a discussion of the therapeutic strategies for GBC.METHODS We retrospectively investigated nineteen GBC patients who underwent surgical treatment.RESULTS Nearly all symptomatic patients had poor outcomes, while suspicious or incidental GBCs at early stages showed excellent outcomes without the need for two-stage surgery. Lymph nodes around the cystic duct were reliable sentinel nodes in suspicious/incidental GBCs. Intentional LN dissection and EHBD resection prevented metastases or recurrence in early-stage GBCs but not in advanced GBCs with metastatic LNs or invasion of the nerve plexus. All patients with positive surgical margins (e.g., the biliary cut surface) showed poor outcomes. Hepatectomies were performed in sixteen patients, nearly all of which were minor hepatectomies. Metastases were observed in the left-sided liver but not in the caudate lobe. We may need to reconsider the indications for major hepatectomy, minimizing its use except when it is required to accomplish negative bile duct margins. Only a few patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemoradiation. There were significant differences in overall and disease-free survival between patients with stages <= IIB and >= IIIA disease. The median overall survival and disease-free survival were 1.66 and 0.79 years, respectively.CONCLUSIONOutcomes for GBC patients remain unacceptable, and improved therapeutic strategies, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, optimal surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, should be considered for patients with advanced GBCs.

TI  - In Situ Observations of Light-Absorbing Carbonaceous Aerosols at Himalaya: Analysis of the South Asian Sources and Trans-Himalayan Valleys Transport Pathways
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountain-valleys along the south margin of the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau (HTP), referred to as trans-Himalayan valleys, are transport pathways of atmospheric pollutants from the South Asia lifting to the HTP based on atmospheric models and satellite detections. However, few field studies can be conducted to confirm the aerosol transport along these valleys due to the harsh environment and limited power supply. Individual particle collection instruments offer the unique advantage of collecting samples and tracing particle sources in remote areas due to their portability and efficiency. In this study, transmission electron microscopy was used to study individual particles collected in two trans-Himalayan valleys. We found that 49-70% of thousands of particles were light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols including soot-bearing and tarball-bearing particles in December of 2017. The dominant sizes of soot-bearing and tarball-bearing particles were 151-370 and 198-255 nm, respectively. The WRF-Chem model and wind field analyses show that the intense regional air pollution with high mass concentrations of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosol occurred in the South Asia and southwest wind normally prevailed along the trans-Himalayan valleys in the afternoon of each day during wintertime. Backward trajectory and CALIPSO data further confirm that these light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols from the South Asia were transported to the southern HTP. These carbonaceous aerosols exhibited significantly internally mixing with secondary sulfates. Here individual particle analysis coupled with the WRF-Chem model, the meteorological observation data, and satellite data confirm the trans-Himalayan valleys as the direct channels for abundant carbonaceous aerosols lifting from the South Asia to the HTP.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion and the subsequent sedimentation are the major problem in Ethiopia. We assessed the impact of rainfall-induced soil erosion and prioritize the sub-watersheds using RUSLE and SYI models. We procured mean annual precipitation, Abay Basin soil map, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS, 2017 datasets. Results show that annual estimated soil loss was <= 270 and <= 120 tha(-1)yr(-1)whereas, mean rates were 37.72 and 23.92 tha(-1)yr(-1)for RUSLE and SYI models respectively. Both the models have identified similar to 25% area of sub-watersheds (SW19 to SW23) has similar average soil loss (>20 tha(-1)yr(-1)) at higher elevations. Interestingly, similar erosion severity, priority level and ranks were observed through RUSLE and SYI. Findings indicate a strong relationship between erosion rate and topography. The severe erosion prone area requires immediate action for conservation treatment proposed in study.

TI  - Land use land cover mapping and monitoring urban growth using remote sensing and GIS techniques in Mangaluru, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation induced land use and a land cover change is a proliferating phenomenon worldwide. The impacts of chaotic urban growth are all well documented. To overcome the ill effects of urbanisation, continuous monitoring and sustainable planning are the keys. As the future urban growth in India is predicted to take place in small cities of less than a million populations, it is the crucial time to plan a strategy for sustainable urban growth. Mangaluru, being a small, emerging city has the basic fertility required for urban growth. But the deficiencies of spatial data availability and lack of insight for impending urbanisation scenario would hamper the sustainable management of urban growth in the region. In this context, the current study proposes to map land use and land cover and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban growth in Mangaluru urban agglomeration, India, during 1972-2018. The present study employs techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) and uses Landsat series of imageries. The land use and land cover changes and dynamics of urban growth have been studied using change detection, Shannon entropy, and spatial trend analysis. The study reveals that the rapid increase in the built-up area is largely induced by intense in fill growth in the core range of the city which is further corroborated by the Shannon entropy value, which indicates the compact nature of city growth. It has been found that built-up area has increased from 3.68% in 1972 to 18.79% in 2018. Agricultural land on the other hand decreased from 36.51-11.22% during 1972-2018 period. The spatial trend of change analysis represents the expansion of built-up land along with the transport network, and predominantly following a north-south course. Landsat image classification has also shown that Land use and land cover have largely changed during 1972-2018.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment and Normalisation of Water Spread Area Estimate from Multi-sensor Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water spread area is one of the few parameters that can be easily derived using multispectral satellite data. However, due to limitation in land-water boundary pixel delineation and availability of area estimate from simultaneous images of different spatial resolutions, it poses serious challenges for accurate estimation of water spread area. The area estimated from data of different resolutions is not the same owing to many factors like shape and size of the water body and the efficiency of the approaches to delineate land-water boundary pixel. In addition to this, multiple coverage of same water body from sensors of different resolutions will lead to varying water spread area estimates. In order to assess the effect of these factors on water spread area estimate, a study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of water spread area estimate using the field-based measurement and to establish relationship for normalisation of water spread area estimate from different resolution sensors. In this study, water boundary was traced by collecting continuous measurements of location with the help of satellite-based positioning system. The study showed that water spread area estimated through linear spectral unmixing of images from LISS IV, LISS III, AWiFS and MSI sensors resulted in better estimate compared to the index-based method. The error in estimate was less than 5% in all the cases except for AWiFS-based estimate for the smaller water body. The study also concluded that either simple linear regression equation or multiple linear regression equation can be used to normalise the water spread area estimated from different sensors.

TI  - Automated surface water detection from space: a Canada-wide, open-source, automated, near-real time solution
T2  - CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this research was to develop a fully automated method to map open water extent that is operationally practical on a national scale. Such a system needs to produce acceptable results in all regions of the country and particularly in the Prairie Potholes Region where understanding water surface dynamics is important for predicting flooding, agriculture/water availability and for evaporation calculations in weather models. A system was developed to automate, ingest, and process Radarsat-2 (RS2) imagery, from which mapping open water body extents in near-real time was carried out using a machine learning classification technique. A Random Forest classification algorithm was trained using the data extracted from the Global Surface Water (GSW) occurrence dataset. The GSW occurrence thresholds used to extract the training data were examined and there was little influence of uncertainty on the classification. The quality of classifications generated from RS2 Fine Wide mode imagery improved with increasing incidence angle. All Fine Quad incident angles produced acceptable results, but Standard and Wide mode imagery produced results below the accuracy thresholds deemed acceptable for this operational solution. Validation was carried out by comparing mapped water extents to temporally coincident high resolution multi-spectral imagery and to the USGS Global Land Cover Characteristics dataset, that is currently used as a land-water mask by ECCC in weather numerical weather modelling. The system that has been developed will allow new image datasets (e.g. Radarsat Constellation Mission) or training data that becomes available to be used to improve models. The open source code will be made available on Github.

TI  - Effects of organic mercury on <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> hemocyte function and morphology
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Filter-feeding organisms accumulate xenobiotics and other substances in their tissues. They can be useful as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring of the marine compartment. Bivalve cellular immunity is ensured by phagocytosis and cytotoxic reactions carried out by hemocytes in a network with humoral responses. These can be affected by chemical contaminants in water that can be immunosuppressors also at a low concentration increasing the sensibility to pathogens. This work is an attempt to individuate cellular markers for pollution detection, investigating the effect of methylmercury (CH3HgCl) at different concentrations on the activity and hemocyte morphology of the Mediterranean mussel,Mytilus galloprovincialis. We assessed the effect of three sub-lethal concentrations of the organometal on the cellular morphology, the efficacy of phagocytosis toward yeast cells, the alteration of the lysosomal membrane and the ability to release cytotoxic molecules. The results provide information on the alteration of hemocyte viability, modification of the morphological and cytoskeletal features and besides the cellular spreading, intrinsic ability of motile cells was used as a complementary investigation method. Exposure to the contaminant affected the percentage of phagocytosis and the phagocytosis index. Moreover, morphological and cytoskeleton alteration, caused by the pollutant, leads to reduced ability to incorporate the target and adhere to the substrate and the low ability of cells to retain neutral red could depend on the effects of methylmercury on membrane permeability. These results reinforce the use of the Mediterranean mussel as model for the evaluation of environmental quality in aquatic ecosystems integrating the novel information about hemocyte functions and morphology sensibility to organic mercury.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Long-term effects of ambient PM2.5 on hypertension in multi-ethnic population from Sichuan province, China: a study based on 2013 and 2018 health service surveys
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypertension, a major risk factor of many severe chronic diseases and leading cause of global disease burden, is reported to be associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5. China's high PM(2.5)pollution level has become a major public health issue. However, existing studies from China have got inconsistent results with very limited investigation into the multi-ethnic peoples. This study adds multi-ethnic evidence from Sichuan Province, southwestern China, and assesses ethnic differences of PM(2.5)exposure effect on hypertension. We pooled large cross-sectional data from two surveys conducted in 2013 and 2018 to examine the association of long-term exposure to PM(2.5)on prevalence of hypertension in adults aged 30 years old and above. Community-specified annual PM(2.5)concentration was estimated using satellite data. Thirty-one thousand four hundred sixty-two participants with average exposure concentration of 32.8 mu g/m(3)were included. The proportions of the Han, the Tibetan, the Yi, and other ethnic people were 89.2%, 7.3%, 3.2%, and 0.3%, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.04-1.12) for a 10 mu g/m(3)PM(2.5)concentration increment. The adjusted ORs for the Han, the Tibetan, and the Yi were 1.08 (95% CI, 1.04-1.12), 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.27), and 1.75 (95% CI, 1.28-2.38) for a 10 mu g/m(3)PM(2.5)concentration increment, respectively. Stratification analysis found stronger associations in participants with chronic diseases and Yi minority population. The results showed that long-term exposure to PM(2.5)may increase the risk of hypertension prevalence in Chinese multi-ethnic adults. The associations were different among ethnicities.

TI  - Comparison of MODIS- and CALIPSO-Derived Temporal Aerosol Optical Depth over Yellow River Basin (China) from 2007 to 2015
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Collection 6.1 (C6.1) of different aerosol optical depth (AOD) products of different spatial resolutions were used from the aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) including dark target (DT), deep blue (DB), deep blue (DB), and DT-DB (DTB). These products were compared with cloud-aerosol lidar, and infrared pathfinder satellite observation (CALIPSO) AOD retrievals over the Yellow River Basin (YERB), China from 2003 to 2017. The YERB was divided into three sub-regions, namely YERB1(the mountainous terrain in the upper reaches of the YERB), YERB2(the Loess Plateau region in the middle reaches of the YERB), and YERB3(the plain region downstream of the YERB). Errors and agreement between MODIS and CALIPSO data were reported using Pearson's correlation (R) and relative mean bias (RMB). Results showed that the CALIPSO whole layers AOD (AOD(S)) were better matched with MODIS AOD than the CALIPSO lowest layer AOD (AOD(1)). The time series of AOD shows higher values in spring and summer, and a small difference in AOD products was observed in autumn. The overall average value of CALIPSO AOD and MODIS AOD both fitted the order: YERB3 > YERB2 > YERB1. The CALIPSO AOD retrievals have the best consistency with the DTB10K and the lowest consistency with DT3K. Overall, the regional distributions of the CALIPSO AOD and MODIS AOD are significantly different over the YERB, and the difference is closely related to the season, region, and topography. This study can help researchers understand the difference of aerosol temporal and spatial distribution utilizing different satellite products over YERB, and also can provide data and technical support for the government in atmospheric environmental governance over YERB.

TI  - Prediction of potato high-yield zones of a field: bivariate frequency ratio technique
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivariate frequency ratio (BFR) technique was employed to determine high-yield zones in a 30 ha potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) field located in Wadi-Ad-Dawasir, Saudi Arabia. BFR was performed by inputting selected yield tendency factors (YTFs) and potato actual yield (Y-A). The YTFs were NDVI-derived from Sentinel-2 images, soil electrical conductivity, nitrogen, pH and texture. The obtained yield tendency map (Y-P) was assessed against Y-A using the area under the curve metric. Although low accuracy (41- 58%) was observed with the individual YTFs, high- yield zones were determined with an accuracy of 90% using the cumulative response of YTFs.

TI  - Calibration Accuracy Evaluation of Visible and Near-Infrared Bands of FY-3B MERIS
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-3B medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) cannot achieve the absolute calibration for the visible and near-infrared bands. To improve the MERIS absolute calibration accuracy, the six widely used north African desert pseudo-invariant targets arc adopted herein, taking the advantage of the high-quality SeaWiFS data to construct the bidirectional reflectance distribution function(BRDF) model and then using the MODTRAN radiative transfer model and ERA-Interim absorption gas reanalysis data to construct the spectral band adjustment factor (SHAF). Lastly, five years of FY-3B MERIS data arc used for the cross-calibration. The constructed BRDF model in this study can accurately express the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (rho(TOA)) over the pseudo-invariant targets, and the prediction error is basically within 3%. The TOA reflectance of MERIS can be effectively predicted through the parameterized SHAF which considers the observation geometry and absorbed gas content. Cross-calibration results show that the time series arc extremely stable and have no obvious trends, which arc consistent with the characters of TOA reflectance over pseudo-invariant targets. Compared with the operational calibration results of MERIS L1, the cross-calibration results of bands 8-12 arc lower and the bias is less than zero, whereas for bands 13-16, the results arc higher and the bias is greater than zero. Except for band 8, the biases of the other eight bands arc within -5%-5%. The monthly mean deviation of bands with a wavelength less than 600 nm arc larger, particularly the three blue bands (bands 8-10). The monthly mean relative deviations of bands 13-16 arc relatively stable, and they arc basically within -5%-5%.

TI  - Multitemporal image encoding for monitoring spatiotemporal variations of water bodies using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing enables multitemporal information of the Earth's surface and the dynamic processes that affect the environment. Given the considerable data availability, methods to summarize multitemporal datasets are needed to support the analysis. Our study introduces and compares methods to monitor temporal variations of water bodies based on multitemporal image composition. For this purpose, the presence of water at different dates is mapped applying the normalized difference water index using two encoding methods. The first one is based on the cumulative analysis of water in the pixel along time, and the second one uses the principle of binary encoding. The cumulative analysis helps to visualize more humid and dry areas, while binary encoding indicates the monthly variations of the lake surface, storing information about the dynamics of the phenomenon. The methods are compared using Landsat time series of Lake Poopo obtained between 2013 and 2019. The results showed that binary encoding allows detecting when and where severe droughts affect the water body and its recovery. In addition, it was possible to monitor the severe drought that affected the lake in 2016 and it was also noticed that its surface is still below the level registered before the drought in 2013.

TI  - Enhancing Information Content in the Satellite-Derived Daytime Infrared Sea Surface Temperature Dataset Using a Transformative Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The regression-based operational daytime Sea Surface Temperature (SST) retrieval from remote sensing Infrared (IR) measurements does not conventionally use Mid-Wave IR (MWIR) channels due to solar contamination. However, MWIR channels are desirable to obtain unambiguous surface information. A transformative approach, Physical Deterministic Sea Surface Temperature (PDSST) retrieval scheme, including MWIR channels, to enhance the information content in satellite-derived SST data, is presented here. This paper mainly emphasizes on the quality and availability of swath-processed daytime SSTs from MODIS-AQUA radiances using the PDSST suite, including MWIR channels, for coastal and near-coastal areas, which are needed the most. The focus areas of this study are the California coast in the Pacific Ocean, which is a highly dynamic oceanographic region, the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, which has a sparse population of in situ, and the Chesapeake Bay in the Atlantic Ocean, which is best known for seafood production. Apart from in situ validation using iQuam (NOAA), indirect validation, by comparing different SST products, is also performed. The results of PDSST-suite are compared with the currently operational MODIS-AQUA SSTs, obtained from the NASA website, and microwave SSTs from AMSR2, obtained from RSS website. Both the operational products are based on the regression method. It is found that the PDSST suite including MWIR channels can extract 3-5 times as much information as the currently operational NASA-produced regression-based daytime SSTs from MODIS-AQUA radiances for coastal areas. Oceanic fronts' study is also included by using the increased information content of satellite-derived SSTs from PDSST.

TI  - Calibration of global MODIS cloud amount using CALIOP cloud profiles
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud detection procedure classifies instantaneous fields of view (IFOVs) as either "confident clear", "probably clear", "probably cloudy", or "confident cloudy". The cloud amount calculation requires quantitative cloud fractions to be assigned to these classes. The operational procedure used by the MODIS Science Team assumes that confident clear and probably clear IFOVs are cloud-free (cloud fraction 0 %), while the remaining categories are completely filled with clouds (cloud fraction 100 %). This study demonstrates that this "best-guess" approach is unreliable, especially on a regional/local scale. We use data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument flown on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission, collocated with Aqua MODIS IFOV. Based on 33 793 648 paired observations acquired in January and July 2015, we conclude that actual cloud fractions to be associated with MODIS cloud mask categories are 21.5 %, 27.7 %, 66.6 %, and 94.7 %. Spatial variability is significant, even within a single MODIS algorithm path, and the operational approach introduces uncertainties of up to 30% of cloud amount, notably in polar regions at night, and in selected locations over the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. China, the north-west coast of Africa, and eastern parts of the United States). Consequently, applications of MODIS data on a regional/local scale should first assess the extent of the uncertainty. We suggest using CALIPSO-based cloud fractions to improve MODIS cloud amount estimates. This approach can also be used for Terra MODIS data, and other passive cloud imagers, where the footprint is collocated with CALIPSO.

TI  - Potential Evaluation of High Spatial Resolution Multi-Spectral Images Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in Accurate Recognition of Crop Types
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate acquisition of farmland planting information is the basis of precision agriculture. Collecting remote sensing data via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a convenient method to obtain precision agricultural information because of the high spatiotemporal resolution and flexibility. A quadrotor UAV equipped with a SEQUOIA sensor (one multi-spectral sensor and one RGB lens) was operated over the Jingyuetan agricultural area with five land cover types on September 4, 2017, to investigate the equipment's feasibility for crop identification. To evaluate the effects of different data and classification methods on the accuracy of crop type classification, three combinations were tested: MDC + Four (Mahalanobis distance classifiers based on four-band reflectance), MDC + VIs (Mahalanobis distance classifiers based on Vegetation Indices) and MLC + VIs (maximum likelihood classifiers based on Vegetation Indices). The accuracy of the different classification methods was 83.06% (MDC + Four), 89.17% (MDC + VIs) and 92.60% (MLC + VIs). The MLC + VIs scheme was the most accurate, as it could partially overcome the influence of shadow and flattened. Since the reflectivity of different bands varied, all kinds of objects on the ground could be distinguished. This result revealed that multi-spectral UAV technology has the potential to identify crop type at the sub-meter spatial resolution, with the MLC based on the VIs.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy using dual methods of blue dye and radioactive isotope is what is practised as the standard of care at most of the centres. The combined use of radioactive colloid and blue dye injection is considered the gold standard for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer with a 97% accuracy rate. The aim of this study is to determine the optimal injection site for methylene blue dye and Tc99-labelled sulphur colloid for sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer. In both periareolar and peritumoral groups of patients, overall rate of identifying sentinel lymph node (hot, blue and hot and blue nodes) with dual dye was comparable (100% and 96.36%) withpvalue = 0.475. Also in both groups of patients, overall rate of getting pathological positive sentinel lymph node on final histopathological report was comparable (52.73% and 45.28%) withpvalue = 0.561. Periareolar versus peritumoral injection of dual dye shows comparable success rates for axillary sentinel lymph node identification and can be considered rapid and reliable method. However, the periareolar route is technically simple and especially privileged in nonpalpable (T0) and upper outer quadrant lesions mainly for the prevention of the shine through phenomenon.

T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Intraoperative evaluation of lymph nodal metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) assumes importance and avoids over-treatment in clinically node negative (N0) neck. Frozen section (FZ) is the commonly employed technique, but it requires significant investment in resources, time, and personnel. Intraoperative imprint cytology (IC) is a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive alternative. We conducted a prospective study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative IC and FZ for lymph node metastasis in HNSCC. Methods All patients presenting with HNSCC with clinically N0 neck undergoing surgery were included in the study, and intraoperative assessment of clinically suspicious nodes was done using IC and FZ and was reviewed by two independent pathologists. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of IC and FZ were calculated with reference to the final histopathology report. The time duration for reporting was calculated. Results Thirty-four patients with clinically N0 neck were included in the study, and 85 slides were examined. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FZ were 100%, 98.6%, and 98.9%, respectively, whereas for IC, it was 85.7%, 95.8%, and 94.1%, respectively. The mean time duration for reporting for FZ and IC was 41.18 +/- 3.62 and 18.12 +/- 2.01 minutes, respectively. Conclusion IC provides a cheaper, accurate, and rapid alternative for FZ for intraoperative assessment of neck nodes in HNSCC, and it assumes importance in resource-driven countries like India.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of Changes in the Depth and Surface Area Snow of the Mountains in Iran Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the critical role of snowfall in water resources supply and its impacts on the environment, studying and measuring snow levels changes as one of the most important sources of water supply is very important. The purpose of this study is to monitor and analyse changes in surface area and depth of snow and changes in groundwater aquifers in Iran. For this purpose, TERRA-MODIS satellite image data for Iran were used. The timeframe of the selected images is between 2000 and 2019. Tips for selecting images are taken into account, with an average image of 3 months (January, February and March of winter) in each year. According to the results, the decreasing trend of groundwater aquifers is highly correlated with the amount of snow fall decrease in the study area at the level of 0.92%, and this decrease has been highly correlated since 2008. Average quarterly snow depth variations (January, February and March) in the study area fluctuated between 2000 and 2019, the most severe between 2007 and 2010 (with the 2009 snowfall of 41 cm). In general, a comparison of the changes in snow cover levels in the study area shows that 2005 has the highest rate (236,065/649 km(2)) while in 2007 and 2008 which has more snow cover than other years.

TI  - The Hough transform algorithm coupled with spatial filtering for the study of geological structuring control on the drainage network: application to the North Oulmes region, Morocco
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In a changing climate, the more we understand the drainage networks distribution and structuration, the more we can better predict flood risks, and ensure better water resource management. The identification of geological lineaments is a basic approach for the study and analysis of surficial geological structuring that potentially controls the drainage networks distribution and subsurface water resources. Taking the North Oulmes region in Morocco as an example, an automatic lineament detection algorithm based on the Hough transform has been applied to the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1 SAR data. This technique was coupled with spatial filtering and field data with the aim of identifying surface geological structures that may control the drainage network. This study also presents an analysis of the drainage network which concerns the identification of similarities between its structuring and geological lineaments, through the analysis of rose diagrams and the identification of the different drainage network patterns. The results show that the geological lineaments identified by the algorithm are very satisfactory, geologically significant, and represent continuity toward the surface of the underlying structures. The findings of this study also show that the conformation of the drainage network characteristics with the geological structures and the rectangular and trellis drainage patterns observed in the study area indicate that the distribution and structuring of the drainage network is mainly controlled by the geological structures trending NE-SW resulting from the Hercynian tectonic event.

TI  - Evaluating Alternative Metacommunity Hypotheses for Diatoms in the McMurdo Dry Valleys Using Simulations and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Diatoms are diverse and widespread freshwater Eukaryotes that make excellent microbial subjects for addressing questions in metacommunity ecology. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, the simple trophic structure of glacier-fed streams provides an ideal outdoor laboratory where well-described diatom assemblages are found within two cyanobacterial mat types, which occupy different habitats and vary in coverage within and among streams. Specifically, black mats ofNostocspp. occur in marginal wetted habitats, and orange mats (Oscillatoriaspp. andPhormidiumspp.) occur in areas of consistent stream flow. Despite their importance as bioindicators for changing environmental conditions, the role of dispersal in structuring dry valley diatom metacommunities remains unclear. Here, we use MCSim, a spatially explicit metacommunity simulation package for R, to test alternative hypotheses about the roles of dispersal and species sorting in maintaining the biodiversity of diatom assemblages residing in black and orange mats. The spatial distribution and patchiness of cyanobacterial mat habitats was characterized by remote imagery of the Lake Fryxell sub-catchment in Taylor Valley. The available species pool for diatom metacommunity simulation scenarios was informed by the Antarctic Freshwater Diatoms Database, maintained by the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research program. We used simulation outcomes to test the plausibility of alternative community assembly hypotheses to explain empirically observed patterns of freshwater diatom biodiversity in the long-term record. The most plausible simulation scenarios suggest species sorting by environmental filters, alone, was not sufficient to maintain biodiversity in the Fryxell Basin diatom metacommunity. The most plausible scenarios included either (1) neutral models with different immigration rates for diatoms in orange and black mats or (2) species sorting by a relatively weak environmental filter, such that dispersal dynamics also influenced diatom community assembly, but there was not such a strong disparity in immigration rates between mat types. The results point to the importance of dispersal for understanding current and future biodiversity patterns for diatoms in this ecosystem, and more generally, provide further evidence that metacommunity theory is a useful framework for testing hypotheses about microbial community assembly.

TI  - Incidence of influenza virus infections confirmed by serology in children and adult in a suburb community, northern China, 2018-2019 influenza season
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In mainland China, seasonal influenza disease burden at community level is unknown. The incidence rate of influenza virus infections in the community is difficult to determine due to the lack of well-defined catchment populations of influenza-like illness surveillance sentinel hospitals. Objectives We established a community-based cohort to estimate incidence of seasonal influenza infections indicated by serology and protection conferred by antibody titers against influenza infections during 2018-2019 influenza season in northern China. Methods We recruited participants in November 2018 and conducted follow-up in May 2019 with collection of sera every survey. Seasonal influenza infections were indicated by a 4-fold or greater increase of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody between paired sera. Results Two hundred and three children 5-17 years of age and 413 adults 18-59 years of age were followed up and provided paired sera. The overall incidence of seasonal influenza infection and incidence of A(H3N2) infection in children (31% and 17%, respectively) were significantly higher than those in adults (21% and 10%, respectively). The incidences of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in children and adults were both about 10%, while the incidences of B/Victoria and/Yamagata infection in children and adults were from 2% to 4%. HI titers of 1:40 against A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were associated with 63% and 75% protection against infections with the two subtypes, respectively. Conclusions In the community, we identified considerable incidence of seasonal influenza infections. A HI titer of 1:40 could be sufficient to provide 50% protection against influenza A virus infections indicated by serology.

TI  - Monitoring Human Activities in Jiaozi Mountain Nature Reserve Based on Remote Sensing During 1992-2018
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite remote sensing technology to monitor human activities in nature reserves has advantages of being real-time, efficient, objective and accurate. Remote sensing images can be used to interpret and extract the degree of human interference and its spatial-temporal distribution patterns, thus problems existing in management and protection can be discovered and evaluated timely to support the decision-making practice of local management, which is of great significance for scientifically evaluating and improving the effectiveness of management and conservation in nature reserves. Taking multi-time period Landsat and high-resolution satellite imagery as data sources, the human activities of Jiaozi Mountain nature reserve in 1992, 2000 and 2018 were extracted, including the residential area, farmland, transportation land, other construction land, and tourism land. Subsequently, the temporal and spatial patterns of human activities were analyzed with land cover transfer matrix and disturbance index. The results show that (1) The human disturbance in the nature reserve during each period changed to some extent, and the area ratio fluctuated from 1.563% in 1992 to 2.191% in 2000 and then fell to 1.412% in 2018. (2) Types and intensity of human disturbance dynamically varied over time with residential area and farmland dominated in 1992 and the ratio of tourism land, transportation land and other construction land increased in 2018. The human impact index increased from 6.64x10(-4) in 1992 to 7.90x10(-4) in 2000 and then decreased to 6.80x10(-4) in 2018. (3) The spatial patterns of human activities showed dynamic changes over time. During 1992 and 2018, there was still a small number of human activities in the core area, with obviously decreasing in the buffer zone and gradually expanding to the experimental area. The findings implied that the area of human activities and disturbances have been reduced overall since the nature reserve under different managing levels of municipal in 1992, provincial in 2000, and national in 2018. However, human interference is still severe in the nature reserve, the development of tourism and agriculture in recent years accounts for the main driving factors.

TI  - Monitoring benthic habitats using Lyzenga model features from Landsat multi-temporal images in Google Earth Engine
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic habitats have conventionally been monitored through physical site visits by diving. This requires the use of expensive resources and time to achieve the desired results. This study adopts remotely sensed Landsat multi-temporal images to monitor benthic habitats within marine protected areas in Kenya. We adopt the Lyzenga approach to compute depth invariant index features on Google Earth Engine (GEE) API to aid benthic classification. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning algorithms were used for the supervised classification of benthic habitats based on training classes selected under the guidance of an initialK-means unsupervised classification. RF had a higher overall accuracy of 83.48% compared to SVM at 52.69% as per 2015 reference data. We, therefore, used RF to map benthic habitats between 2003 and 2018. Findings indicate that there are high conversions between corals, seagrass and sand benthic classes. Since environmental and anthropogenic pressures act synergistically in causing changes, an in-depth research would be necessary to assess the vulnerability of benthic habitats to these factors. However, the use of multi-spectral imagery and powerful GEE cloud computing platform can aid monitoring and acquisition of marine data.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Depth in Karnataka Using Digital Soil Mapping Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information of soil depth in regional and national level is essential for arriving crop suitability decisions. In the present study, high-resolution (250 m) soil depth map of Karnataka is prepared using digital soil mapping approach. A total of 5174 Soil legacy datasets studied by NBSS&LUP over a period of 30 years is collected and organized for mapping. Quantile regression forest (QRF) and regression kriging (RK) algorithm is tested to predict the soil depth in Karnataka. Topographic attributes derived from digital elevation model, normalized difference vegetation index, landsat-8 data and climatic variables are used as covariates. For model calibration, 80% of soil depth data is used and 20% of data is used for validation. The classical uncertainty estimates such as coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) and bias were calculated for the validation datasets in order to assess the model performance. RK model explained maximum variability for prediction of soil depth (R-2 = 30%, RMSE = 34 cm) compared to QRF (R-2 = 17%, RMSE = 37 cm). Lithology and elevation are found to be most important variables for prediction of soil depth in Karnataka. The predicted soil depth in Karnataka is ranged from 22 to 173 cm, and the present high-resolution (250 m) soil depth maps are useful in different hydrological, crop modelling and climate change studies.

TI  - The Comprehensive Fire Information Reconciled Emissions (CFIRE) inventory: Wildland fire emissions developed for the 2011 and 2014 US National Emissions Inventory
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildland fire emissions from both wildfires and prescribed fires represent a major component of overall U.S. emissions. Obtaining an accurate, time-resolved inventory of these emissions is important for many purposes, including to account for emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, as well as to model air quality for health, regulatory, and planning purposes. For the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2011 and 2014 National Emissions Inventories, a new methodology was developed to reconcile the wide range of available fire information sources into a single coherent inventory. The Comprehensive Fire Information Reconciled Emissions (CFIRE) inventory effort utilized satellite fire detections as well as a large number of national, state, tribal, and local databases. The methodology and results for CONUS and Alaska were documented and compared against other fire emissions databases, and the efficacy of the overall effort was evaluated. Results show the overall spatial pattern differences and relative seasonality of wildfires and prescribed fires across the country. Prescribed burn emissions occurred primarily in non-summer months were concentrated in the Southeast, Northwest, and lower Midwest, and were relatively consistent year to year. Wildfire emissions were much more variable but occurred primarily in the summer and fall. Overall, CFIRE represents a third of total emitted PM2.5 across all sources in the National Emissions Inventory, with prescribed fires accounting for nearly half of all CFIRE emissions. Compared with other wildland fire emissions inventories derived solely from satellite detections, the CFIRE inventory shows markedly increased emissions, reflecting the importance of the multiple national and regional databases included in CFIRE in capturing small fires and prescribed fires in particular. Implications: Wildland fire emissions inventories need to incorporate multiple sources of fire information in order to better represent the full range of fire activity, including prescribed burns and smaller fires. For the 2011 and 2014 U.S. National Emissions Inventory, a methodology was developed to collect, associate, and reconcile fire information from satellite data as well as a large number of national, regional, state, local, and tribal fire information databases across the country. The resulting emissions inventory shows the importance of this type of integration and reconciliation when compared against other emissions inventories for the same period.

TI  - A global coral reef probability map generated using convolutional neural networks
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reef research and management efforts can be improved when supported by reef maps providing local-scale details across global extents. However, such maps are difficult to generate due to the broad geographic range of coral reefs, the complexities of relating satellite imagery to geomorphic or ecological realities, and other challenges. However, reef extent maps are one of the most commonly used and most valuable data products from the perspective of reef scientists and managers. Here, we used convolutional neural networks to generate a globally consistent coral reef probability map-a probabilistic estimate of the geospatial extent of reef ecosystems-to facilitate scientific, conservation, and management efforts. We combined a global mosaic of high spatial resolution Planet Dove satellite imagery with regional Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project reef extents to build training, validation, and application datasets. These datasets trained our reef extent prediction model, a neural network with a dense-unet architecture followed by a random forest classifier, which was used to produce a global coral reef probability map. Based on this probability map, we generated a global coral reef extent map from a 60% threshold of reef probability (reef: probability >= 60%, non-reef: probability < 60%). Our findings provide a proof-of-concept method for global reef extent estimates using a consistent and readily updateable methodology that leverages modern deep learning approaches to support downstream users. These maps are openly-available through the Allen Coral Atlas.

TI  - Habitat Suitability Analysis of Himalayan Musk Deer (<i>Moschus leucogaster</i>) in Part of Western Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) is considered endangered by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is under Schedule-I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, because of its illicit hunting for musk as well as habitat loss. The present study aims to study the summer range habitat suitability of this important Himalayan ungulate in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) of Western Himalaya, India. The study integrated ground presence point locations of the species with satellite data-derived variables in a binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR) model to analyse its suitability status in KWS. Moist temperate forest (323.38 km(2)) was found to be the dominant vegetation type, followed by sub-alpine forest (128.24 km(2)) and alpine pasture (119.51 km(2)) in KWS. It was found that 7.39% (72.04 km(2)) of the study area is highly suitable, followed by 14.73% (143.68 km(2)), 13.43% (131.02 km(2)) and 64.44% (628.46 km(2)) area as suitable, moderately suitable and least suitable, respectively, for the species. The results also revealed that 71.59% (51.57 km(2)) of the highly suitable habitat occurs in sub-alpine forest, 18.41% (13.26 km(2)) in alpine pasture and 5.63% (4.06 km(2)) in alpine scrub. It was found that the vegetation type/land use was the most significant variable for habitat suitability assessment of the Himalayan musk deer in KWS. The BMLR model could successfully predict the potential summer range habitat of the species (Relative Operating Characteristics curve = 0.85). The findings of this study could be of immense use in the management of this Wildlife Sanctuary for better protection and conservation of the Himalayan musk deer.

TI  - Groups in contact: Meta-representations, interobjectivity, and cultural incompatibilities
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE THEORY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - This analysis departs from social identity being part and parcel of the system of social representations a group holds. Additionally, social identity is seen as being affectively laden with religious or other deeply ingrained ideological beliefs. These systems delimit the space of norms and behaviours where people socially construct the objects defining the local world as an objectively given. The local objectifications differ between groups and cultures and pose a problem for interaction and communication between members of different groups. Inter-group discrepancies must be bridged by establishing a shared representational space and interobjective understanding. This understanding can be reached if both interactants mutually develop meta-representations that allow them to grossly anticipate what to expect from the other and to orient their actions accordingly. But there is a catch in establishing interobjectivity: even if the interactants manage to overcome semantic and cognitive barriers, their interaction and open-minded communication will be blocked if the two objectivities are ethically or affectively incommensurable. I illustrate this process by suggesting that native Europeans will feel blocked to establish interobjective acceptance for example with proponents of a slave holder culture whose values are incommensurable with European ideas of human equality. Accepting a slave holder's worldview would threaten the European's identity. A similar process seems to govern devout conservative Muslims living in 'gated communities' and enclaves in European cities who try to maintain their identity by avoiding regular contact with the non-Muslim majority. Such contact would threaten their identity if their worldview and sharia rules were measured by the standards of human rights. Native Europeans on the other hand, will feel their own cultural objectivity to be incompatible with traditional Islam that does not equally observe human rights. The implications of such processes are discussed in terms of migrants' integration, multiculturalism, and socio-political psychology.

TI  - Pursuing the Promise of Preschool: An Exploratory Investigation of the Perceptions of Parents Experiencing Homelessness
T2  - EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rates of homelessness are worsening in the United States, with a third of individuals experiencing homelessness being families with children. These families face many challenges, including limited social supports, insufficient access to services, and mental health concerns. These challenges inform a nuanced worldview, leading parents experiencing homelessness to understand their child's school life in unique ways. The purpose of this study is to explore how parents experiencing homelessness understand their children's participation in Head Start and publicly funded 4 K programs. We utilized semi-structured interviews with parents of 4 K students and applied an iterative approach for analysis to identify emergent themes and concepts. Results suggest families enter homelessness through several avenues and struggle with many aspects of homelessness, including stigma directed at parents and children. Parents identified many strengths in their children's school programs, including education and support from faculty, as well as areas for growth, such as more comprehensive transportation and meal services. Overall, these results suggest families experiencing homelessness encounter many barriers to finding stable housing. Additionally, parents of children experiencing homelessness value their child's education and access to resources in schools while still fearing the potential for their child to experience stigmatization and discrimination in schools.

TI  - A Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-based approach to optimize the spectral and spatial quality of component substitution-based pansharpened images
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening aims to fuse a lower-resolution multispectral (MS) image and a higher-resolution panchromatic image, resulting in an image with the color quality of the former and spatial detail quality of the latter. Of all, the component substitution (CS)-based pansharpening methods have drawn attentions with their ability to produce sharp images. Despite their success in sharpening the images, these methods deteriorate the color features of the input MS images due of the uncertainty in the calculation of the intensity component used by them. Previous studies showed that attempts to preserve the color features tend to cause spatial detail loss to a certain extent. This, of course, reveals the necessity of a compromise between the spectral and spatial fidelity of the pansharpened images produced by the CS-based techniques. This study proposed using the multi-objective Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II metaheuristic algorithm with the CS-based methods to optimize the intensity component to find the best compromise between the spectral and spatial fidelity of the pansharpened images. The proposed framework was applied on two commonly used pansharpening techniques, Gram-Schmidt and Synthetic Variable Ratio. It was found that the proposed methods managed to find the best balance between the color and spatial fidelity.

TI  - Global terrestrial carbon fluxes of 1999-2019 estimated by upscaling eddy covariance data with a random forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The terrestrial biosphere is a key player in slowing the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While quantification of carbon fluxes at global land scale is important for mitigation policy related to climate and carbon, measurements are only available at sites scarcely distributed in the world. This leads to using various methods to upscale site measurements to the whole terrestrial biosphere. This article reports a product obtained by using a Random Forest to upscale terrestrial net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production, and ecosystem respiration from FLUXNET 2015. Our product covers land from -60 degrees S to 80 degrees N with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees every 10 days during the period 1999-2019. It was compared with four existing products. A distinguishable feature of our method is using three derived variables of leaf area index to represent plant functional type (PFT) so that measurements from different PFTs can be mixed better by the model. This product can be valuable for the carbon-cycle community to validate terrestrial biosphere models and cross check datasets.

TI  - Hybrid modelling approach for water body change detection at Chalan Beel area in northern Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a strategic resource for both socio-economic development and human life. The current study has been carried out for spatio-temporal change detection of surface water bodies during winter period using hybrid modelling approach. The study area has fallen in the northern part of Bangladesh and is locally called Chalan Beel with 5 million of in habitants, a prominent intensive crop production, surface and groundwater irrigation, high evapotranspiration, and water scarcity. For the detection of water body changes, satellite images of 1999 and 2011 were used, and the following image fusion techniques were applied: (a) Gram-Schmidt (GS), (b) modified intensity hue saturation (IHS), (c) high-pass filter (HPF), and (d) wavelet. Landsat 7/ETM+panchromatic (PAN) band of 15 mx15 m resolution in 1999 and Landsat 5/TM multispectral (MS) bands of 30 mx30 m resolution in 2011 were allied each other to generate high-resolution image that contains information of two different years. The fused images were classified to extract the water bodies using four classification methods: (a) artificial neural network (ANN), (b) support vector machine (SVM) and (c) maximum likelihood (ML). To analyze the quality of the fused images, statistical calculation (quantitatively) and Laplacian edge detection (qualitatively) were used. To validate the fused image classification results, the multispectral images from 1999 and 2011 were again individually classified using principal component analysis (PCA), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and image differencing (ID) processes and compared with the previous classification. Surprisingly, the results showed that two-third of the areas dried up in 10 years.

AB  - Eelgrass (Zostera marinaL.) is a marine angiosperm plant that grows throughout coastal areas in Atlantic Canada. Eelgrass meadows provide numerous ecosystem services while they have been acknowledged as important habitats, their location, extent, and health in Atlantic Canada are poorly understood. This study examined the effectiveness of WorldView-2 optical satellite imagery to map eelgrass presence in Tabusintac, New Brunswick, an estuarine lagoon with extensive eelgrass coverage. The imagery was classified using two supervised classifiers: the parametric Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and the nonparametric Random Forest (RF) classifier. While RF was expected to produce higher classification accuracies, it was shown not to be much better than MLC in this particular context. The overall validation accuracy was 96.36% for both the RF and MLC classifiers. Finally, the comparison of our 2014 classified image with a 2008 eelgrass distribution map shows an increase in eelgrass extent in the bay between both years.

TI  - Detecting the development stages of natural forests in northern Iran with different algorithms and high-resolution data from GeoEye-1
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, taking advantage of multispectral sensors with the high spatial and spectral resolution and using a variety of plant indices and remote sensing have provided the possibility of more accurate analysis and classification of satellite data in the identification of natural phenomena. Nowadays, obtaining information about the structure of forests through remote sensing data to manage renewable resources is of interest to managers and researchers. This study produced the development maps of natural forests in northern Iran by taking advantage of GeoEye-1 data, training samples, and various algorithms through the pixel-based, object-based, and model-based methods. The classification's ultimate accuracy was calculated by each of the above methods with the overall accuracy parameters and kappa coefficient. By examining the accuracy of map classification resulting from different methods, the maximum accuracy (78%) in object-based method was estimated based on the segmentation of NDVI and the maximum likelihood algorithm. Meanwhile, some other classification methods showed much less accuracy. The results showed that the algorithms following the structural patterns for pixel distribution classification provided a higher accuracy. Also, these results showed the high potential of high-resolution data from GeoEye-1 in the production of forest development maps and the effect of choosing the appropriate algorithm in the production of higher accuracy maps.

TI  - Revisiting T Cell Tolerance as a Checkpoint Target for Cancer Immunotherapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the majority of patients do not respond to therapy, meaning a deeper understanding of tumor immune evasion strategies is required to boost treatment efficacy. The vast majority of immunotherapy studies have focused on how treatment reinvigorates exhausted CD8(+)T cells within the tumor. In contrast, how therapies influence regulatory processes within the draining lymph node is less well studied. In particular, relatively little has been done to examine how tumors may exploit peripheral CD8(+)T cell tolerance, an under-studied immune checkpoint that under normal circumstances prevents detrimental autoimmune disease by blocking the initiation of T cell responses. Here we review the therapeutic potential of blocking peripheral CD8(+)T cell tolerance for the treatment of cancer. We first comprehensively review what has been learnt about the regulation of CD8(+)T cell peripheral tolerance from the non-tumor models in which peripheral tolerance was first defined. We next consider how the tolerant state differs from other states of negative regulation, such as T cell exhaustion and senescence. Finally, we describe how tumors hijack the peripheral tolerance immune checkpoint to prevent anti-tumor immune responses, and argue that disruption of peripheral tolerance may contribute to both the anti-cancer efficacy and autoimmune side-effects of immunotherapy. Overall, we propose that a deeper understanding of peripheral tolerance will ultimately enable the development of more targeted and refined cancer immunotherapy approaches.

TI  - Estimation of Phytoplankton Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in the Western Basin of Lake Erie Using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algae blooms have been a serious problem in coastal and inland water bodies across Canada. The temporal and spatial variability of algae blooms makes it difficult to usein situmonitoring of the lakes. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data for monitoring algal blooms in Lake Erie. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)-related products of these sensors were tested by using the Great Lakes Chl-a NOAA's monitoring data over summer 2016 and 2017, respectively. Our results show that while fluorescent light height (FLH) algorithm and models are limited to lakes with Chl-a < 8 mg/m(3), maximum chlorophyll index (MCI) has the potential to be used effectively to monitor Chl-a concentration over Eutrophic lakes. Sentinel-3's MCI is suggested for Chl-a > 20 mg/m(3)and Sentinel-2 MCI for Chla > 8 mg/m(3). Top of atmosphere (TOA) radiances showed a significantly better correlation within situdata compared to TOA reflectance, which may be related to the poor pixel identification during the process of pixel flagging affected by the complexity of Case-2 water. Sentinel-2 MCI achieves better performance for Chl-a retrieval (R-2= 0.92) than the existing methods. However, the FLH algorithms outperformed negative reflectance due to the shift of reflectance peak to longer wavelengths along with increasing Chl-a values.

AB  - Water shortage is an actual warning to food production for people in semi-arid areas. Due to overuse, it is necessary to describe appropriate approaches, plans, and management for irrigated land. Pullambadi command area faces water crisis throughout the year, due to over-exploitation of water in irrigation for both Ariyalur and Tiruchirappalli district. Due to improper utilization of water, it is necessary to find proper crop evaporation (ETc) and crop coefficient (K-c) for proper management of water resources. The crop water estimation for the years 2015 and 2016 was computed for the Pullambadi canal in this study adopting remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) approach to identify the crop water demand and crop water supply using crop coefficient. Banana, sugarcane, and paddy crops were identified with the assistance of Landsat-8 satellite images as well as Google Earth. Hargreaves method was adopted for the valuation of reference evapotranspiration. ET(c)and water requirement of different crops were spatially analysed, and it was high in the western region and less in the eastern part. It was found that sugarcane crop requires more water than other crops. A simplified water balance approach was opted to estimate the water demand requirement supply. The requirement of water supply for all crops was high during July-October season. Incorporation of these findings in irrigation scheduling and planning could improve the management and, largely, demonstrate the water resources in the study area. Remote sensing and GIS approach in irrigation water scheduling are helpful due to fast quantification than tradition methods.

TI  - Closing the loop on test results to reduce communication failures: a rapid review of evidence, practice and patient perspectives
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundCommunication failures involving test results contribute to issues of patient harm and sentinel events. This article aims to synthesise review evidence, practice insights and patient perspectives addressing problems encountered in the communication of diagnostic test results.MethodsThe rapid review identified ten systematic reviews and four narrative reviews. Five practitioner interviews identified insights into interventions and implementation, and a citizen panel with 15 participants explored the patient viewpoint.ResultsThe rapid review provided support for the role of technology to ensure effective communication; behavioural interventions such as audit and feedback could be effective in changing clinician behaviour; and point-of-care tests (bedside testing) eliminate the communication breakdown problem altogether. The practice interviews highlighted transparency, and clarifying the lines of responsibility as central to improving test result communication. Enabling better information sharing, implementing adequate planning and utilising technology were also identified in the practice interviews as viable strategies to improve test result communication. The citizen panel highlighted technology as critical to improving communication of test results to both health professionals and patients. Patients also highlighted the importance of having different ways of accessing test results, which is particularly pertinent when ensuring suitability for vulnerable populations.ConclusionsThis paper draws together multiple perspectives on the problem of failures in diagnostic test results communication to inform appropriate interventions. Across the three studies, technology was identified as the most feasible option for closing the loop on test result communication. However, the importance of clear, consistent communication and more streamlined processes were also key elements that emerged.Review registrationThe protocol for the rapid review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42018093316.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - North China Plain is the largest agricultural production center in China and wheat-maize rotation is a widespread cultivation practice in this area. As gross primary production (GPP) is a proxy of land productivity, research on its spatial-temporal dynamics helps understand the variation of grain production in wheat-maize rotation. Here, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and ground observation data were combined to drive Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) in GPP estimation over wheat-maize rotation area during 2000-2015. Annual GPP has increased by 540.95 g C m(-2 )year(-1)from 2000 to 2015, while total annual GPP has grown similar to 150% than that of 2000. Moreover, annual GPP showed an increasing trend in the consecutively wheat-maize rotation area between 2000 and 2015. A strong linear relationship between GPP estimates and grain production demonstrated the potential of using VPM model to evaluate grain production in wheat-maize rotation area of Henan province, China.

TI  - Repeat Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence After Breast Conserving Surgery With Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Pooled Analysis Using Data From a Systematic Review and Two Institutions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction:Best surgical approach of axillary staging remains controversial in locally recurrent breast cancer. We evaluated the reliability of repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (reSLNB) in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in terms of identification rate (IR) and false negative rate (FNR). To address the FNR, we identified patients who underwent sequential axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after reSLNB. Methods:A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were conducted to identify patient-level data from articles. We searched for data of patients who underwent BCS with SLNB for primary breast cancer and who underwent sequential ALND after reSLNB due to local recurrence. Patients data was also identified by the same criteria at two institutions. Results:In total, 197 peer-reviewed publications were obtained, of which 20 included patients who met the eligibility criteria. Data from 464 patients were collected. From the two institutions, 31 patients were identified. A total of 495 patients were pooled. The IR of reSLNB was 71.9% (356/495). To address the FNR of reSLNB, 171 patients who underwent ALND after reSLNB were identified. The FNR and accuracy of reSLNB were 9.4% (5/53) and 97.1% (165/170), respectively. Conclusion:Our pooled data analysis showed that the FNR of reSLNB is lower than 10%, indicating that this operation is a reliable axillary surgery in patients with IBTR after they underwent BCS.

TI  - Surface displacement revealed by L-band InSAR analysis in the Mayya area, Central Yakutia, underlain by continuous permafrost
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent increases in global temperature have stimulated permafrost degradation associated with landform deformation caused by the melting of excess ground ice (thermokarst). Central Yakutia is underlain by ice-rich continuous permafrost, and there are complicated permafrost-related features in forested and deforested areas. This situation makes thermokarst monitoring necessary over a wide area to achieve a better understanding of its dynamics. As a case study, we applied L-band InSAR analysis to map surface subsidence due to thermokarst in this area and to demonstrate the suitability of L-band SAR for such monitoring. Our results show that InSAR detected subsidence/uplift signals in deforested areas and alasses; whereas, there were few ground deformation signals in forested areas with middle coherence. The InSAR stacking process, including both seasonal and inter-annual displacements, showed subsidence in deforested areas during 2007-2010 and 2015-2018, in the range of 0.5-3 cm yr(-1). We also estimated the inter-annual subsidence to be up to 2 cm yr(-1) during 2015-2018, using InSAR pairs that spanned the same seasonal interval but in different years. The magnitude of subsidence and the spatial patterns are qualitatively reasonable as thermokarst subsidence compared to observations using field surveys and high-resolution optical images. L-band InSAR was effective in maintaining coherence over a long period for a partially forested thermokarst-affected area, which resulted in deriving the inter-annual subsidence by the stacking using four interferograms. The advantage of the persistent coherence in L-band InSAR is crucial to better understand thermokarst processes in permafrost regions.

TI  - Summer warming explains widespread but not uniform greening in the Arctic tundra biome
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic warming can influence tundra ecosystem function with consequences for climate feedbacks, wildlife and human communities. Yet ecological change across the Arctic tundra biome remains poorly quantified due to field measurement limitations and reliance on coarse-resolution satellite data. Here, we assess decadal changes in Arctic tundra greenness using time series from the 30m resolution Landsat satellites. From 1985 to 2016 tundra greenness increased (greening) at similar to 37.3% of sampling sites and decreased (browning) at similar to 4.7% of sampling sites. Greening occurred most often at warm sampling sites with increased summer air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture, while browning occurred most often at cold sampling sites that cooled and dried. Tundra greenness was positively correlated with graminoid, shrub, and ecosystem productivity measured at field sites. Our results support the hypothesis that summer warming stimulated plant productivity across much, but not all, of the Arctic tundra biome during recent decades. Satellites provide clear evidence of greening trends in the Arctic, but high-resolution pan-Arctic quantification of these trends is lacking. Here the authors analyse high-resolution Landsat data to show widespread greening in the Arctic, and find that greening trends are linked to summer warming overall but not always locally.

TI  - Tailoring the radiotherapy approach in patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma based on inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives The aim of our study was to analyze the results of selective inguinal node irradiation in patients with anal cancer, based on the biopsy of the inguinal sentinel lymph node (SLN), in terms of local control and prognosis. Methods Records of patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma from January 2001 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Tc99 lymphoscintigraphy was performed in all the clinically inguinal negative patients, followed by radio-guided surgical removal of the inguinal SLN. All patients were treated with combined radiochemotherapy. In patients with negative sentinel nodes, the inguinal area was excluded in the radiotherapy field. Results A total of 123 patients, 76 females (61.8%), mean age 60.1 +/- 12.19 years old, underwent intraoperative lymph node retrieval. The histological analysis showed metastasis in the SLN in 28 patients (22.8%). The mean follow-up was 43.44 +/- 31.86 months. No inguinal recurrence was observed in patients with negative inguinal sentinel node(s). A statistically significant difference was observed for overall and disease-free survivals in a patient with positive and negative inguinal sentinel nodes. Conclusions In patients with anal canal cancer, the exclusion of the inguinal regions from the radiotherapy field, in patients with negative SLN, does not compromise locoregional control nor prognosis.

TI  - Assessment of topographical and atmospheric errors in Sentinel 1 derived DInSAR
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) techniques are extensively utilized over decades to monitor and detect surface distortion. Interferometric SAR results obtained from Sentinel 1 data experience phase delay due to interference with the atmospheric water vapour and pressure and DEM is considered as one of the important parameter in topographic phase removal. In the present study, an attempt was made to eradicate the atmospheric errors and to assess the variation of LOS displacement with respect to different DEM. Results concluded GACOS based atmospheric correction eradicate the atmospheric error and help in improving the quality of LOS displacement. Comparison of InSAR results by utilizing SRTM, ALOS and Cartosat DEM and GACOS concluded that LOS displacement varies based on the accuracy of DEM and its resolution with the minimum error identified by utilizing CartoDEM over Kodagu region.

TI  - Long-term effects of forest fire on habitat use by siamangs in Southern Sumatra
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires can cause direct mortality to wildlife, and the associated habitat damage can reduce carrying capacity and population densities. However, little is known about long-term responses of animals to fire in the wet tropics. From 2000-2015, we examined siamang ranging patterns in habitat damaged by fire to assess the effects on these arboreal frugivores. We mapped home ranges (HR) of seven siamang groups inhabiting contiguous HR 3-5, 10-12, and 17-18 years post-fire. We predicted that if habitat connectivity or quality improved over time in burned areas, HR should become larger and centroid locations should shift toward recovering areas. Since territoriality constrains siamang ranging, we examined effects of social and habitat factors on ranging. By 18 years post-fire, tree density in the burned area had returned to the 1997 baseline, but composite LandSat images indicated that tree species composition differed in burned and unburned forest. Our data and the associated models indicated that HR sizes in burned forest increased over time whereas those in unburned forest did not. Centroid locations moved little (15.5 +/- 6.9 m y(-1)) and their movement appeared to be predominantly influenced by social factors, although HR centroids in burned habitat shifted further into the burned area while those in adjacent unburned forest did not. In a large burned area unused by siamangs before 2012, two new groups were observed 15-17 years post-fire, although one subsequently disappeared. This is the first study of the long-term effects of fire on small ape habitat use. By 18 years post-fire, siamangs had incorporated some burned areas into their HR, but did not use heavily damaged areas. Reduced frugivore densities in burned areas may inhibit forest regeneration by disrupting seed dispersal.

TI  - Suitability of resampled multispectral datasets for mapping flowering plants in the Kenyan savannah
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollination services and honeybee health in general are important in the African savannahs particularly to farmers who often rely on honeybee products as a supplementary source of income. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the floral cycle, abundance and spatial distribution of melliferous plants in the African savannah landscapes. Furthermore, placement of apiaries in the landscapes could benefit from information on spatiotemporal patterns of flowering plants, by optimising honeybees' foraging behaviours, which could improve apiary productivity. This study sought to assess the suitability of simulated multispectral data for mapping melliferous (flowering) plants in the African savannahs. Bi-temporal AISA Eagle hyperspectral images, resampled to four sensors (i.e. WorldView-2, RapidEye, Spot-6 and Sentinel-2) spatial and spectral resolutions, and a 10-cm ultra-high spatial resolution aerial imagery coinciding with onset and peak flowering periods were used in this study. Ground reference data was collected at the time of imagery capture. The advanced machine learning random forest (RF) classifier was used to map the flowering plants at a landscape scale and a classification accuracy validated using 30% independent test samples. The results showed that 93.33%, 69.43%, 67.52% and 82.18% accuracies could be achieved using WorldView-2, RapidEye, Spot-6 and Sentinel-2 data sets respectively, at the peak flowering period. Our study provides a basis for the development of operational and cost-effective approaches for mapping flowering plants in an African semiarid agroecological landscape. Specifically, such mapping approaches are valuable in providing timely and reliable advisory tools for guiding the implementation of beekeeping systems at a landscape scale.

TI  - Geo-spatial approach for land-use and land-cover changes and deforestation mapping: a case study of Ankasha Guagusa, Northwestern, Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is the replacement of forest by other land-use. Land-use patterns are changing fast in worldwide in relation to the human population growth and agricultural land expansion. The study deals with the status and trends of land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics and identification of deforestation risk zones Ankasha Guagusa, northwestern, Ethiopia following in the recent advancement in geospatial approach. The temporal Landsat satellite data from 1985 to 2018 was used for the analysis. Supervised classification approach with maximum likelihood algorithm was adopted for the classification and generation of land-use and land-cover maps for the chosen time periods. Results reveal that there have been substantial changes in the LULC during the selected periods. During the period 1985-1996 showed increased the cropland, bare-land and built-up with 835 ha (1.78%), 186.54 ha (0.4%) and 112. ha (0.24%), respectively. In the second period (1996-2006) forest land, built-up and cropland increased with 1094 ha (2.33%), 346.78 ha (0.74%) and 2185.7 ha (4.65%), respectively. This implies that the forest cover change had decreased by 1119.78 ha (2.38) in the first period and increased in the second and third period with 1094.04 ha (2.33%) and 772.91 ha (1.64%), respectively. It was raveled that forest cover though remained relatively stable around western part of the study area. Identification of deforestation risk zone to examine five factors criteria was selected such as infrastructure, topographic and socio-economic behavior of the area. These are slope, proximity to road, population density, proximity to river and proximity to town. Each criterion was evaluated with the aid of AHP and mapped by GIS. The degree of deforestation risk was categorized as extreme, high, moderate and low suitability areas, which represented 2%, 40.27%, 56.65% and 1.04%, of the study area, respectively. Therefore, sustainable forest management system is necessity to protect, conserve and rehabilitate the remaining forest.

TI  - You Can Talk about Your Cat, but You Can Also Talk about Your God: Witnessing in Hermeneutical-Communicative Worldview Education
T2  - RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the function of teachers' witnessing of faith in worldview education in the context of diversity in the classroom. Pollefeyt described three teaching roles for hermeneutical-communicative worldview education: moderator, specialist, and witness. These roles aim to support students in their personal worldview identity development. However, witnessing seems to be associated with the transmittal of a specific tradition. We explore Pollefeyt's intentions with witnessing and his didactical application. We deepen his perspective with Ricoeur's philosophical and biblical explorations of testimony which help to clarify witnessing and to position this didactical role in the interreligious educational space of vulnerability and hospitality. In closing, witnessing is related to the concepts of authenticity, moral agency, role model and self-disclosure to show its relationship to more general aspects of teaching.

TI  - Improving data access democratizes and diversifies science
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The foundation of the scientific method rests on access to data, and yet such access is often restricted or costly. We investigate how improved data access shifts the quantity, quality, and diversity of scientific research. We examine the impact of reductions in cost and sharing restrictions for satellite imagery data from NASA's Landsat program (the longest record of remote-sensing observations of the Earth) on academic science using a sample of about 24,000 Landsat publications by over 34,000 authors matched to almost 3,000 unique study locations. Analyses show that improved access had a substantial and positive effect on the quantity and quality of Landsat-enabled science. Improved data access also democratizes science by disproportionately helping scientists from the developing world and lower-ranked institutions to publish using Landsat data. This democratization in turn increases the geographic and topical diversity of Landsat-enabled research. Scientists who start using Landsat data after access is improved tend to focus on previously understudied regions close to their home location and introduce novel research topics. These findings suggest that policies that improve access to valuable scientific data may promote scientific progress, reduce inequality among scientists, and increase the diversity of scientific research.

TI  - The thermal-optical trapezoid model-based soil moisture estimation using Landsat-8 data
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter that can be used as a precursor to predict natural disasters such as meteorological drought and flooding, and environmental changes, such as storm and soil erosion. Thus, precise awareness of spatial changes in soil moisture is essential to understand and monitor regular land and water management processes. In this paper retrieval of soil moisture was carried out using TOTRAM (thermal optical trapezoid) model which relies on relationship of land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The relation is based on the fact that soil moisture is associated with both LST and NDVI that impacts vegetation growth, and soil moisture variation can be mapped based on the changes. Validation of soil moisture retrieval was done with the data provided at VEDAS portal. The outcome of the study shows that the model has nearly same accuracy as of the VEDAS portal. We argue on the strong inherent relationship of soil moisture with LST, and NDVI and its usability in the soil moisture retrieval for a large geographical area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of importance of the ice shelves as a probable sign of global climate change, temporal changes of Antarctic ice shelf margins are largely unknown. In the present article, an attempt has been made for chronological mapping of major four Antarctic ice shelf fronts for the period 2001-2016, using MODerate resolution Imaging Satellite images. Vector layers of individual ice shelves from 2001 to 2015 have been overlaid on the image of 2016. It is found that all the four ice shelves have advanced; the Filchner ice shelf advanced maximum (24 km) and the Ross ice shelf advanced minimum (16 km). Maximum range in yearly rate of advance is observed at Ronne Ice Shelf and the highest variability in rate of advance is observed over Filchner ice shelf. In terms of area change, maximum expansion occurred at Ronne ice shelf (8813 km(2)) and least expansion is observed over Amery ice shelf (2520 km(2)). Poor correlation between rates of change at different ice shelves suggests that different atmospheric and oceanic drivers are responsible for changes at individual ice shelves. Interestingly, the highest rate of advance as well as higher variability in rate of advance is observed over the latter half of the study period.

TI  - Hyperspectral and multispectral data fusion using fast discrete curvelet transform for urban surface material characterization
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study is to analyze the quality of hyperspectral data fusion using low spatial hyperspectral (LSH) Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) 8 m data and high spatial multispectral (HSM) WorldView-3 image at 1.24 m remote sensing images with spectral unmixing technique. The resultant HSH data shows new prospects for urban surface material characterization with spectrally distinct classes. The spatial resolution of LSH is enhanced by injecting the high-frequency details from the corresponding HSM bands in fast discrete curvelet transform domain. The image fusion-based products' quality has been analyzed by endmembers extraction and fractional maps generated using Piecewise Convex Multiple-Model Endmember Detection (PCOMMEND) method. Experimental results showed that the fusion has improved the spatial as well as spectral separability to extract the endmembers, particularly for the urban surface materials like the combination of water and asphalt, and bare soil and roof tiles.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources planning and design always deal with precipitation estimation and measurements. In arid and semi-arid climates of developing countries with inadequate numbers of rainfall stations, satellite data become increasingly important. The main objective of this research is to assess the daily rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM-3B42 V7) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) products with rain-gauge data over a semiarid climate. The study was carried out in Khorasan Razavi Province located in northeast of Iran which is relatively very well equipped with synoptic rainfall stations. Daily rainfall data from 13 stations were collected for a period of 4 years, starting from Feb 2015 to Nov 2018 and compared with the available daily GPM and TRMM-3B42 V7 data. The comparison was performed on daily, monthly, and seasonal timescales. All satellite precipitation products (SPPs) correlated well with measurements from rain-gauge data on the monthly timescale, but moderately on the daily timescale. However, the TRMM data were found slightly better than GPM products. On the seasonal scale, it was found that all SPPs correlated well with measurements from gauges in spring, summer, and winter but in fall, TRMM products outperformed GPM. The GPM products slightly overestimated the data in all of the season except fall, but the TRMM products tended to underestimate the values in all of the seasons except spring. It was found that the TRMM data made a significant improvement in precipitation estimation and could potentially be one of the reliable sources of data for daily-based hydrological modeling in northeast of Iran.

TI  - Detecting differential ground displacements of civil structures in fast-subsiding metropolises with interferometric SAR and band-pass filtering
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground displacements due to changes in soil conditions represent a threat to the stability of civil structures in many urban areas, worldwide. In fast-subsiding areas, regional subsidence (wavelength similar to 1,000's m) can be dominantly high and, consequently, mask other signals at local scales (wavelength similar to 10-100's m). Still, engineering and construction applications require a comprehensive knowledge of local-scale signals, which can threaten the stability of buildings and infrastructure. Here we present a new technique based on band-pass filters for uncovering local-scale signals hidden by regional subsidence as detected by interferometric SAR measurements. We apply our technique to a velocity field calculated from 21 high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed scenes acquired over Mexico City and obtain components of long (>478 m), intermediate (42-478 m) and short (<42 m) spatial wavelengths. Our results reveal that long-wavelength velocities exceed - 400 mm/year, whereas intermediate- and short-wavelength velocities are in the order of +/- 15 mm/year. We show that intermediate-wavelength velocities are useful for retrieving signals such as uplift along elevated viaducts of Metro lines 4 and B, as well as differential displacements in Pantitlan station's pedestrian overpass system and across sharp geotechnical boundaries in the piedmont of Sierra de Santa Catarina-where surface faulting occurs.

TI  - Patient Perspectives on Treatment Options for Older Women With Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer A Qualitative Study
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - This qualitative study evaluates older women's preferences for sentinel lymph node biopsy and radiotherapy in the setting of guidelines recommending them or allowing for their omission.Question What are older women's perspectives on recommendations for treatment de-escalation for low-risk, early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer? Findings In this qualitative study of 30 participants aged 70 years or older, women expressed skeptical views regarding age-based treatment guidelines, difficulty interpreting the rationale for reducing low-value care to be a favorable rather than poor prognosis, and perceived benefit of some low-value therapies for peace of mind. Meaning Emphasizing an overall favorable prognosis and improving patient education on the risks vs benefits of adjuvant therapies may help reduce overtreatment in older women with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.Importance Women aged 70 years or older with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer have an excellent prognosis, but because of their age and comorbidities, they are at higher risk for treatment-related adverse events. Despite studies demonstrating the safety of omitting previously routine therapies, including sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and postlumpectomy radiotherapy, these treatments continue to be used at high rates. Physicians cite patient preference as one factor associated with overuse. However, little is known about how women view potential de-escalation of therapies. Objective To evaluate older women's preferences for SLNB and radiotherapy in the setting of guidelines recommending them or allowing for their omission. Design, Setting, and Participants This qualitative study was performed from October 2019 to January 2020. Midwestern women aged 70 years and older who had never received a diagnosis of breast cancer were recruited online and interviewed. Guided by an interpretive description approach, interviews were analyzed to produce a thematic description. Data analysis was performed from January to March 2020. Exposures Participants were presented with hypothetical scenarios in which they received a diagnosis of low-risk, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and were given treatment options in accordance with current guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures The interviews elicited perspectives on breast cancer treatment, including surgery, SLNB, chemotherapy, and postlumpectomy radiotherapy. Results The median (interquartile range) age of the 30 participants was 72.0 (71.0-76.5) years. Most of the women were White (26 participants [87%]), lived in metropolitan areas (29 participants [97%]), and were college educated (20 participants [67%] had a 4-year degree or higher). Overall, women expressed the belief that age-based guidelines were appropriate on the basis of decreased recurrence risk and increased frailty in older patients. However, many participants stated that these guidelines should not apply to healthy older women with a long life expectancy. Some participants struggled to understand that the basis for treatment de-escalation in older patients is a favorable, not poor, prognosis. Women who said they would undergo SLNB (12 participants [40%]) perceived the procedure as low risk and providing peace of mind. Most participants (22 participants [73%]) expressed a preference for omitting postlumpectomy radiotherapy because of the perceived risks, lack of benefit, and inconvenience. Conclusions and Relevance Positive reframing of the excellent prognosis driving national recommendations for de-escalation may reduce breast cancer overtreatment in older women. Strategies for reducing SLNB use will likely require education on the risks vs benefits and addressing patient preferences for peace of mind. In contrast, efforts to reduce radiotherapy use may need to address clinician or organizational factors.

TI  - Impacts of solar intermittency on future photovoltaic reliability
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As photovoltaic power is expanding rapidly worldwide, it is imperative to assess its promise under future climate scenarios. While a great deal of research has been devoted to trends in mean solar radiation, less attention has been paid to its intermittent character, a key challenge when compounded with uncertainties related to climate variability. Using both satellite data and climate model outputs, we characterize solar radiation intermittency to assess future photovoltaic reliability. We find that the relation between the future power supply and long-term mean solar radiation trends is spatially heterogeneous, showing power reliability is more sensitive to the fluctuations of mean solar radiation in hot arid regions. Our results highlight how reliability analysis must account simultaneously for the mean and intermittency of solar inputs when assessing the impacts of climate change on photovoltaics. The intermittency of solar resources is one of the primary challenges for the large-scale integration of the renewable energy. Here Yin et al. used satellite data and climate model outputs to evaluate the geographic patterns of future solar power reliability, highlighting the tradeoff between the maximum potential power and the power reliability.

TI  - Remote sensing of the impact of flash drought events on terrestrial carbon dynamics over China
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Flash drought poses a great threat to terrestrial ecosystems and influences carbon dynamics due to its unusually rapid onset and increasing frequency in a warming climate. Understanding the response of regional terrestrial carbon dynamics to flash drought requires long-term observations of carbon fluxes and soil moisture at a large scale. Here, MODIS satellite observations of ecosystem productivity and ERA5 reanalysis modeling of soil moisture are used to detect the response of ecosystems to flash drought over China. Results The results show that GPP, NPP, and LAI respond to 79-86% of the flash drought events over China, with highest and lowest response frequency for NPP and LAI, respectively. The discrepancies in the response of GPP, NPP, and LAI to flash drought result from vegetation physiological and structural changes. The negative anomalies of GPP, NPP, and LAI occur within 19 days after the start of flash drought, with the fastest response occurring over North China, and slower responses in southern and northeastern China. Water use efficiency (WUE) is increased in most regions of China except for western regions during flash drought, illustrating the resilience of ecosystems to rapid changes in soil moisture conditions. Conclusions This study shows the rapid response of ecosystems to flash drought based on remote-sensing observations, especially for northern China with semiarid climates. Besides, NPP is more sensitive than GPP and LAI to flash drought under the influence of vegetation respiration and physiological regulations. Although the mean WUE increases during flash drought over most of China, western China shows less resilience to flash drought with little changes in WUE during the recovery stage. This study highlights the impacts of flash drought on ecosystems and the necessity to monitor rapid drought intensification.

TI  - Shedding light on the convergence debate: Using luminosity data to investigate economic convergence in Ecuador
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to analyze convergence in incomes per capita in Ecuador over the period 1992-2013. Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite data capturing nighttime luminosity by region to proxy income, we undertake an analysis of economic convergence between provinces and cantons in Ecuador over the period 1992-2013. Traditional regression analysis alongside dynamic distribution analysis is used to verify the existence and determine the nature of convergence among Ecuadorian territories. What is found is that economic convergence across Ecuador's provinces can be confirmed with a speed of convergence approximating Barro's iron-law of 2% per annum. In contrast to the expectations of finding convergence over recent years, the major progress in economic convergence was made over the 1992-2002 period. This was the period with the highest political and economic uncertainty. Investigating convergence in human development indicators such as infant mortality rates suggests that the boom-financed period of economic prosperity did however coincide with a significant catchup of provinces lagging in human development achievements to leaders in this dimension.

TI  - Integration of nitrogen dynamics into the land surface model AVIM. Part 2: baseline data and variation of carbon and nitrogen fluxes in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal features of carbon and nitrogen fluxes over China between 1979 and 2015 were simulated by the Atmosphere-Vegetation Interaction Model (AVIM). The carbon fluxes of gross primary production and net primary production captured the distribution pattern in China better than MODIS and TRENDY data. The results for nitrogen deposition and biological nitrogen fixation show the good performance of the AVIM simulation compared with the CMIP6 and CABLE data, with a deposition rate >4 g N m(-2)yr(-1) in south China. The variation in the gross primary production and net primary production can be up to 300 and 200 g C m(-2)yr(-1) in south and southeast China, respectively, and there is a discrepancy between the AVIM and the data from MODIS and TRENDY. This shows the difficulty in simulating the carbon flux in a monsoon climate region and the importance of coupling the nitrogen-carbon fluxes. The standard deviation of nitrogen deposition and biological nitrogen fixation is simulated well by the AVIM and there is a large range in nitrogen deposition of 0.8-1.2 g N m(-2)yr(-1) in south China. The climatological mean of the fluxes performs better than the variation in the standard deviation and anomaly and this variation in the carbon-nitrogen flux is the key to decreasing bias in future modeling studies.

TI  - Longwave radiative effect of the cloud twilight zone
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a key role in Earth's radiation budget, covering more than 50% of the planet. However, the binary delineation of cloudy and clear sky is not clearly defined due to the presence of a transitionary zone, known as the cloud twilight zone, consisting of liquid droplets and humidified to dry aerosols. The twilight zone is an inherent component of cloud fields, yet its influence on longwave-infrared radiation remains unknown. Here we analyse spectral data from global satellite observations of shallow cloud fields over the ocean to estimate a lower bound on the twilight zone's effect on longwave radiation. We find that the average longwave radiative effect of the twilight zone is similar to 0.75 W m(-2), which is equivalent to the radiative forcing from increasing atmospheric CO2 by 75 ppm. We also find that the twilight zone in the longwave occupies over 60% of the apparent clear sky within the analysed low-level cloud fields. As low-level clouds are relatively warm, the overall longwave radiative contribution from the twilight zone is likely to be higher. We suggest that the twilight zone needs to be accounted for to accurately quantify cloud radiative effects and close the global energy budget.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between LST and land cover of Bengaluru by concentric ring approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims at investigating the impact of land cover features in enhancing or mitigating Land Surface Temperature (LST) in a semi-arid tropical metropolitan city of Bengaluru, India. Spatial distribution of LST and land cover types of the area were examined in the circumferential direction, and the contribution of land cover classes on LST was studied over 28 years. Urban growth and LST were modelled using Landsat and MODIS data for the years 1989, 2001, 2005 and 2017 based on the concentric ring approach. The study provides an efficient methodology for modelling and parameterisation of LST and urban growth by fitting an inverse S-curve into urban density (UD) and mean LST data. In addition, multiple linear regression models which could effectively predict the LST distribution based on land cover types were developed for both day and night time. Based on the analysis of remotely sensed data for LST, it is observed that over the years, urban core area has increased circumferentially from 5 to 10 km, and the urban growth has spread towards outskirts beyond 15 km from the city centre. As urban expansion occurs, the area under the study experiences an expansive cooling effect during day time; at night, an expansive heating effect is experienced in accordance with the growth in UD in the suburban area and outskirts. The regression models that were developed have relatively high accuracy withR(2)value of more than 0.94 and could explain the relationship between LST and land cover types. The study also revealed that there exists a negative correlation between urban, vegetation, water body and LST during day time while a positive correlation is observed during night. Thus, this study could assist urban planners and policymakers in understanding the scientific basis for urban heating effect and predict LST for the future development for implementing green infrastructure. The proposed methodology could be applied to other urban areas for quantifying the distribution of LST and different land cover types and their interrelationships.

TI  - The 2019/20 Australian wildfires generated a persistent smoke-charged vortex rising up to 35 km altitude
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Australian bushfires around the turn of the year 2020 generated an unprecedented perturbation of stratospheric composition, dynamical circulation and radiative balance. Here we show from satellite observations that the resulting planetary-scale blocking of solar radiation by the smoke is larger than any previously documented wildfires and of the same order as the radiative forcing produced by moderate volcanic eruptions. A striking effect of the solar heating of an intense smoke patch was the generation of a self-maintained anticyclonic vortex measuring 1000 km in diameter and featuring its own ozone hole. The highly stable vortex persisted in the stratosphere for over 13 weeks, travelled 66,000 km and lifted a confined bubble of smoke and moisture to 35 km altitude. Its evolution was tracked by several satellite-based sensors and was successfully resolved by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational system, primarily based on satellite data. Because wildfires are expected to increase in frequency and strength in a changing climate, we suggest that extraordinary events of this type may contribute significantly to the global stratospheric composition in the coming decades.The 2019/2020 Australian wildfires generated a smoke cloud that organized itself into a persistent vortex structure and ascended to 35 km altitude through solar heating, according to satellite tracking.

TI  - A candidate secular variation model for IGRF-13 based on MHD dynamo simulation and 4DEnVar data assimilation
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We have submitted a secular variation (SV) candidate model for the thirteenth generation of International Geomagnetic Reference Field model (IGRF-13) using a data assimilation scheme and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo simulation code. This is the first contribution to the IGRF community from research groups in Japan. A geomagnetic field model derived from magnetic observatory hourly means, and CHAMP and Swarm-A satellite data, has been used as input data to the assimilation scheme. We adopt an ensemble-based assimilation scheme, called four-dimensional ensemble-based variational method (4DEnVar), which linearizes outputs of MHD dynamo simulation with respect to the deviation from a dynamo state vector at an initial condition. The data vector for the assimilation consists of the poloidal scalar potential of the geomagnetic field at the core surface and flow velocity field slightly below the core surface. Dimensionless time of numerical geodynamo is adjusted to the actual time by comparison of secular variation time scales. For SV prediction, we first generate an ensemble of dynamo simulation results from a free dynamo run. We then assimilate the ensemble to the data with a 10-year assimilation window through iterations, and finally forecast future SV by the weighted sum of the future extension parts of the ensemble members. Hindcast of the method for the assimilation window from 2004.50 to 2014.25 confirms that the linear approximation holds for 10-year assimilation window with our iterative ensemble renewal method. We demonstrate that the forecast performance of our data assimilation and forecast scheme is comparable with that of IGRF-12 by comparing data misfits 4.5 years after the release epoch. For estimation of our IGRF-13SV candidate model, we set assimilation window from 2009.50 to 2019.50. We generate our final SV candidate model by linear fitting for the weighted sum of the ensemble MHD dynamo simulation members from 2019.50 to 2025.00. We derive errors of our SV candidate model by one standard deviation of SV histograms based on all the ensemble members.

TI  - Projection of future land use/cover change in the Izeh-Pyon Plain of Iran using CA-Markov model
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and prediction of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in natural resource management and environmental monitoring provide the regional and national decision-makers with useful information. Izeh-Pyon Plain as one of the important wildlife habitats in Khuzestan Province, Iran was selected to detect LULC changes in the past three decades (1985-2017), and LULC in 2033 was also predicted. The LULC maps were obtained using the maximum likelihood classification and Landsat images for (TM) 1985, (ETM+) 2001, and (OLI) 2017. The LULC mapping for 2033 was done using cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model and validating the model in the 2017 map simulation. Suitability maps were prepared for each LULC class using weighted linear combination method and applying constraint maps, whereas the weight of each criterion was determined in analytical hierarchy process and standardized based on fuzzy theory. Furthermore, CA-Markov validation was performed using three measures of quantity disagreement, allocation disagreement, and figure of merit. The results showed that from 1985 to 2017, wetlands, forests, and grassland areas decreased by 43.7%, 9.21%, and 8.43%, respectively. In contrast, agricultural lands and residential areas increased by 26.38% and 129.3%, respectively. This decreasing/increasing trend will continue up to 2033, so that one of the wetlands will completely dry out by 2033 and compared with 1985 and 2017, total wetland area will decrease by 68% and 44%, respectively. Since these wetlands are home to many birds and aquatic animals and are considered the tourist attraction of the region, their destruction and the increase of crop production will seriously threaten the ecosystem of the region in the future.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the milling process, milling load and micro-vibration reduction may significantly improve the machining performance. Micro-structuring of the milling tool is one of the perspective approaches, providing force reduction and vibration suppression. In this work, two kinds of micro-structures grooved on the tool rake face have been investigated during aluminum alloy cutting: linear grooves (LG) and V-shaped grooves (VG). Milling load and the surface quality of the machined workpiece were selected to assess the milling performance of the selected tools. The results indicated that the VG milling tool showed the best performance with the reduced average milling loadF(X),F-Y, andF(Z)up to 9.27%, 21.98%, and 12.44% and root mean square error ofF(Y)up to 6.94% compared with a conventional milling tool. Moreover, the usage of the VG milling tool could achieve less galling wear and scratch marks on the machined surface, providing the smallest surface roughness of 0.541.

TI  - Recent development of improved clinching process
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinching technology has been widely applied in automobile assembly industries to join sheet materials of different thicknesses and properties. It does not require any auxiliary parts and only depends on the plastic deformation of materials themselves to form a joint. Furthermore, clinching tools that include the punch and the die are simpler than other thermal joining methods. However, the usability of the clinched joint is restricted by a low joining strength. In order to expand the application range of clinching technologies, researchers have conducted extensive researches on how to improve clinching technologies. In this article, the latest advances of clinching technologies are reviewed on the development of clinching tools and processes. The improved clinching processes including flat clinching, hole clinching, reshaping the clinched joint without a rivet, reshaped joint with a rivet, rivet clinching, rectangular clinching, dieless clinching, roller clinching, laser shock clinching, hydro-clinching, injection clinching, adhesive clinching, resistance spot clinching, friction-assisted clinching, and laser-assisted clinching are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of different clinching technologies are proposed. In addition, some suggestions for the future development of clinching technology are given in this paper. The clinching technology is developing towards a hybrid joining technology with high strength, high stability, and high efficiency.

TI  - Global nitrous acid emissions and levels of regional oxidants enhanced by wildfires
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrous acid (HONO) is a precursor of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere, which controls the degradation of greenhouse gases, contributes to photochemical smog and ozone production, and influences air quality. Although biomass burning is known to contribute substantially to global aerosols and reactive gas emissions, pyrogenic contributions to HONO emissions are poorly constrained and often omitted in models. Here we present a global survey of TROPOMI/Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite sounder observations and show that HONO emissions are consistently enhanced in fresh wildfire plumes. Comparing major ecosystems (savanna, grassland, shrubland and tropical and extratropical forests), we found that the enhancement ratios of HONO to nitrogen dioxide varied systematically with biome type, with the lowest in savannas and grasslands and highest in extratropical evergreen forests. Supported by airborne measurements, we demonstrate that previous assessments underestimate pyrogenic HONO emissions by a factor of 2-4 across all ecosystem types. We estimate that HONO emissions are responsible for two-thirds of the hydroxyl radical production in fresh wildfire plumes worldwide and act to accelerate oxidative plume chemistry and ozone production. Our findings suggest that pyrogenic HONO emissions have a substantial impact on atmospheric composition, which enhances regional ozone levels by up to 7 ppbv.Satellite observations reveal that fresh wildfire plumes are a globally important source of nitrous acid, enhancing oxidative plume chemistry and regional ozone levels.

TI  - Long-term prognosis is associated with residual disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy but not with initial nodal status
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This follow-up analysis of a Swedish prospective multicentre trial had the primary aim to determine invasive disease-free (IDFS), breast cancer-specific (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) rates, and their association with axillary staging results before and after neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer. Methods Women who underwent neoadjuvant systemic therapy for clinically node-positive (cN+) or -negative (cN0) primary breast cancer between 2010 and 2015 were included. Patients had a sentinel lymph node biopsy before and/or after neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and all underwent completion axillary lymph node dissection. Follow-up was until February 2019. The main outcome measures were IDFS, BCSS and OS. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with survival. Results The study included a total of 417 women. Median follow-up was 48 (range 7-114) months. Nodal status after neoadjuvant systemic therapy, but not before, was significantly associated with crude survival: residual nodal disease (ypN+) resulted in a significantly shorter 5-year OS compared with a complete nodal response (ypN0) (83 center dot 3versus91 center dot 0 per cent;P = 0 center dot 017). The agreement between breast (ypT) and nodal (ypN) status after neoadjuvant systemic therapy was high, and more so in patients with cN0 tumours (64 of 66, 97 per cent) than those with cN+ disease (49 of 60, 82 per cent) (P = 0 center dot 005). In multivariable analysis, ypN0 (hazard ratio 0 center dot 41, 95 per cent c.i. 0 center dot 22 to 0 center dot 74;P = 0 center dot 003) and local radiotherapy (hazard ratio 0 center dot 23, 0 center dot 08 to 0 center dot 64;P = 0 center dot 005) were associated with improved IDFS, and triple-negative molecular subtype with worse IDFS. Conclusion The present findings underline the prognostic significance of nodal status after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. This confirms the clinical value of surgical axillary staging after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.

TI  - Application of modified cellular automata Markov chain model: forecasting land use pattern in Lebanon
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article modifies the use of the Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model to predict future land use pattern in Lebanon, and compares it to the current developed model. LandSat images of years 2000, 2009 and 2018 are used to generate land use maps within the geographic information system. Current developed model was generated by integrating Population density data with land use classification maps to decompose the built-up development to three sub-classes: High, Medium and Low-density built-up land uses. Simulations of future land use pattern over the year 2018 based on these two prediction models reveal that the Modified Cellular Automata Markov Chain Modelling technique is more accurate than the Extended Markov Chain model. Spatial effects of built-up densities are validated in this study. Consequently, the extension of the Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model represents an innovative tool for regional and urban planning to forecast potential locative distribution of old and new urban agglomeration. The sequential shift of the urban areas among different density classes in addition to the interactions of urban agglomerations should be employed as a guiding tool for decision-makers and planners during the phase of developing new population and economic strategies, new urban Masterplan and during the process of enacting/developing new land-use policies. In the final part of the study, a simulation of land use pattern for the year 2036 is generated using TerrSet v.18 software and an analysis of the outcome for the forecasted map is discussed.

TI  - COVID-19 lockdown measures reveal human impact on water transparency in the Venice Lagoon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lagoon of Venice has always been affected by the regional geomorphological evolution, anthropogenic stressors and global changes. Different morphological settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for qualitative visual interpretation, showing the reduction of the vessel traffic and their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.

TI  - Gravimetric analysis of the rifts and volcanic fields of the Jalisco block, Mexico
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The gravity map of the complete Jalisco Block (JB) is obtained from satellite-derived measurements at a resolution of similar to 1 km separation, including the offshore region up to the Middle America Trench (MAT). Tepic-Zacoalco (TZ) and Colima delimiting rifts of the JB are identified as gravimetric minima. The NW limit of the block appears also as a rifted zone, with a gravity minimum connecting Bahia de Banderas with the TZ rift, defining a new triple point: the Compostela Triple Point (rift-rift-rift) that together with the Guadalajara Triple Point determine the north boundary of the Jalisco Block. The largest negative gravity anomalies are observed associated with the Central Jalisco Volcanic Lineament (CJVL) and Bahia de Banderas; they appear to be connected since they are only separated by a small positive anomaly east of Bahia de Banderas. The CJVL is parallel to the Middle America Trench, exhibiting a discontinuous alignment of Quaternary volcanism from the Colima Volcanic Complex to the northwestern rifted limit of the Jalisco Block. Ameca and Santiago rivers flow parallel to each other in a northwesterly direction for 100 km, then Santiago river changes course to continue 64 km in a north-northwesterly direction up to Aguamilpa dam. Ameca river should follow the same direction; instead, it abruptly changes its course to a southwesterly direction to discharge in Bahia de Banderas. The drastic course deviation is attributed to the intersection of Ameca river causeway with the Bahia de Banderas-Compostela rift, proposed in this study to be the northwestern limit of the Jalisco Block.

TI  - Revisiting the environmental Kuznets curve for city-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: based on corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing trend of global warming, the Chinese government faces tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R-2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers. This study could be considered the first to simulate CO2 emissions at the provincial and city levels in China based on a NPP-VIIRS nighttime light model to explore the associated geographical distribution characteristics and potential influencing factors.

TI  - A Tale of Two Farms (of Template Discordance and Shame)
T2  - PSYCHOANALYSIS SELF AND CONTEXT
M3  - Article
AB  - Therapists are regularly exposed to verbal memories in the clinical setting, but the automatic behavior of patients can provide an additional window into the past. Template theory uses the concept of a relational template to aid us in tracking back from observable behavior in the consultation room, to developmental events that, through repetition, have encoded those behaviors the patient now automatically exhibits, sometimes out of awareness. A relational template is comprised of three elements: 1) observable automatic behavior, 2) automatic expectancies of others, and 3) relational premises, or beliefs. Any of the multiple relational templates residing in both patient and therapist can be activated in treatment; synchronous pairings blend, while discordant templates create conflict, which may manifest in the therapist's affect. A clinical tale of two disparate experiences involving the topic of "farming" is recounted to demonstrate how an awareness of discordant templates between therapist and patient can expand the understanding of a patient's history. Exploration of differences in behavior and worldview in the analytic pair led to increased understanding of past histories of shame, which helped to resolve a therapeutic impasse. Therapists who understand the origins of their own attitudes, can intuit a different developmental history that gave rise to contrasting beliefs and behaviors in their patients. In this way, observation of automatic non-verbal behavior can be used to deepen our understanding of the patient's developmental history, facilitating insight and the therapeutic process.

TI  - Rift-parallel block-like motion of the graben floor during the 2005-2010 Afar rifting episode
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crustal deformations associated with rifting episodes are often explained by both normal faulting and tensile opening in an elastic body, suggesting no significant rift-parallel displacements. In this study, using ALOS/PALSAR pixel-offset and multiple aperture interferometry (MAI) data, we detected similar to 1 m of northwestward block-like cumulative horizontal motion in the graben floor during the latter half of the 2005-2010 Afar rifting episode, Ethiopia. This horizontal block-like motion can be explained by additional shallower strike-slip on normal fault surfaces, which was presumably aseismic due to the very small number of strike-slip earthquakes and a significant gap between seismic and geodetic moment releases. We conclude that the rift-parallel movement can be interpreted by the strain accommodation of plate oblique spreading associated with dike intrusions, as has been demonstrated for the 2014 Baroarbunga dike intrusion episode. Although we do not propose direct evidence for the plate oblique spreading, the complicated tectonic setting caused by the rotation of the Danakil block and the upwelling plume beneath the Afar triple junction may be drivers of the rift-parallel motion associated with the Afar dike intrusion.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The wavenumber spectra of the chlorophyll "a" concentration (Chl(a)) and the sea surface temperature (SST) were obtained from the data of the shipborne fluorometer and satellite measurements in the area of the anticyclonic eddy in the South China Sea in February-March 2004. In the southwestern part of the eddy, the slope of SST spectrum, received from the ship data was - 2.6 +/- 0.1 at scales of 3-110 km. At the northeastern edge of the eddy, the slope of SST spectrum was - 1.7 +/- 0.1 at the scales of 6-60 km. The slopes of Chl(a)spectra were on average two times flatter than the slopes of the SST spectra, which was most likely due to the predominance of biological factors connected with winter phytoplankton bloom in SCS. The comparison with the spectra calculated from the Level 2 data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)/SeaStar showed that the slopes of SST spectra coincided within a narrow margin of errors, but the slopes of Chl(a)spectra differed over two times. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.

TI  - Investigating the Significance of Aerosols in Determining the Coronavirus Fatality Rate Among Three European Countries
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has not only gripped the scientific community in the search for a vaccine or a cure but also in attempts using statistics and association analysis-to identify environmental factors that increase its potency. A study by Ogen (Sci Total Environ 726:138605, 2020a) explored the possible correlation between coronavirus fatality and high nitrogen dioxide exposure in four European countries-France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Meanwhile, another study showed the importance of nitrogen dioxide along with population density in determining the coronavirus pandemic rate in England. In this follow-up study, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was introduced in conjunction with other variables like nitrogen dioxide and population density for further analysis in fifty-four administrative regions of Germany, Italy and Spain. The AOD values were extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites while the nitrogen dioxide data were extracted from TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) sensor onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Regression models, as well as multiple statistical tests were used to evaluate the predictive skill and significance of each variable to the fatality rate. The study was conducted for two periods: (1) pre-exposure period (Dec 1, 2019-Feb 29, 2020); (2) complete exposure period (Dec 1, 2019-Jul 1, 2020). Some of the results pointed towards AOD potentially being a factor in estimating the coronavirus fatality rate. The models performed better using the data collected during the complete exposure period, which showed higher AOD values contributed to an increased significance of AOD in the models. Meanwhile, some uncertainties of the analytical results could be attributed to data quality and the absence of other important factors that determine the coronavirus fatality rate.

TI  - Mapping and dynamic analysis of mangrove forest during 2009-2019 using landsat-5 and sentinel-2 satellite data along Odisha Coast
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests in India are situated along the tidal sea edge of the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal which is under threat from both natural and human-induced land-use changes. The multi-temporal satellite data and image processing techniques are usually employed to monitor changes in vegetation dynamics. In this study, the decadal changes of mangrove forests were accomplished along the Odisha coast, India using the Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2A satellite data for 2009 and 2019, respectively. The satellite data were obtained and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This study aims to derive the spatial extent of mangrove using the high-resolution satellite data and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The result reveals that the total mangrove extent increased from 222.43 km(2)(2009) to 252.47 km(2)(2019) which indicates an increase in area by 30.04 km(2)(or 13.5%) during the last one decade. The highest increase in mangrove area was in Hatamudia Reserve Forest (15.54 km(2)) and coastal belt of Bhadrak (9.46 km(2)) followed by Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara (3.05 km(2)), Baranaula and Akumi River estuary in Jagatsinghpur (1.12 km(2)), and Subarnarekha River intertidal zone in Baleshwar (0.87 km(2)). A significant increase in mangrove forests occurred due to plantation, awareness, restoration, and coastal zone management plan. This study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution satellite data to produce an accurate map in monitoring changes in mangrove forests at a decadal time-scale by using the GEE platform which can help in planning conservation strategies and priorities.

TI  - Rising vegetation activity dominates growing water use ef ficiency in the Asian permafrost region from 1900 to 2100
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost play an important role in regulating global climate system. We analyzed the gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), and evapotranspiration (ET) derived from MODIS and three earth system models participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in the Asian permafrost region. The water use efficiency (WUE) was further computed. The simulated GPP, NPP, and ET show slightly increasing trends during historical period (19002014) and strong increasing trends in projection period (20152100), and projected impacts of climate change on all variables are greater under high-emission scenarios than low-emission scenarios. Further analysis revealed higher increases in GPP and NPP than that of ET, indicating that vegetation carbon sequestration governs the growing WUE under historical and projected periods in this region. The GPP, NPP and ET showed higher changing rates in western, central and southeast areas of this region, and WUE (WUEGPP, and WUENPP) shows the similar spatial pattern. Compared to MODIS-derived GPP, NPP, and ET during 20002014, Earth system models yield the best estimates for NPP, while slight underestimations for GPP and ET, and thus slight overestimations for WUEGPP and WUENPP. This study highlights the predominant role of vegetation activity in regulating regional WUE in Asian permafrost region under future climate change. Vegetation domination of the growing water use efficiency implies that the permafrost region may continue acting efficiently in sequestrating atmospheric carbon in terms of water consumption throughout the 21st century.

AB  - This article presents a review of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the context of geohazards. The pluri-disciplinary role of UAVs is outlined in numerous studies associated with mass earth movements, volcanology, flooding events and earthquakes. Scientific advances and innovations of several research teams around the world are presented from pre-events investigations to crisis management. More particularly, we emphasize the actual status of technology, methodologies and different applications that have emerged with the use of UAVs for each domain. It is shown that the deployment of UAVs in the geohazards context has experienced a tremendous increase during the last 10 years, with the development of more and more miniaturized, flexible and reliable systems. The use of such technology (UAV platform, instrumentation, methodologies) is different for each domain, depending on the spatial extent and the time scale of the observed phenomenon, but also on the practical constraints associated with the civil aviation agencies regulations (outside or within urban areas, before or during a crisis horizontal ellipsis ). This paper also highlights the use of recent methodologies associated with semi-automatic/automatic segmentation or deep learning for the processing of important amounts of data provided by UAVs. Finally, although still sparse, the joint use of UAVs and satellite data is progressing and remains a challenge for future studies in the context of geohazards.

TI  - Estimating reservoir evaporation: fusing Kohli and Frenken method and the FAO's WaPOR Product
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the limited fresh water resources available, evaporation from dam reservoirs and freshwater lakes whereby large amounts of water resources are lost is now becoming a serious challenge in hydrology and water resource management. In this study, Kohli and Frenken (KF) method and the KF modified (MKF) (for the modification of this method, level I (250 m) reference evapotranspiration (RET) data were obtained from the FAO's WaPOR Product (FWP) which is a ready product based on remote sensing (RS)) were utilized to estimate reservoir evaporation (RE) in seventeen stations in Iran for the period of 9 years: 2009-2018. The current study includes four distinct steps, as follows. In the first step, the KF method was evaluated with the ground data (measured), and the ready RS product was then validated in the second step. In the third step, we evaluated the MKF method. Finally, in the fourth step, a number of statistical indices were evaluated for each of the methods in order to examine its performance. The results indicated that there was no significant difference between the estimated evaporation values using KF method and the measured values based on the statistical indices. As such, the validation of the ready RS product was acceptable for all dam reservoirs. Moreover, it was found that coefficients of the MKF equation for all stations had a relatively high degree of reliability (R > 0.871). Also, these coefficients had a wide range of variations in different regions, so using a fixed coefficient for all stations will have a relatively large error. The findings also revealed that using the MKF method can improve the performance of the KF method from 0.11 to 9.28%.

TI  - Landscape-wide changes in land use and land cover correlate with, but rarely explain local biodiversity change
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context There is an ongoing debate whether local biodiversity is declining and what might drive this change. Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are suspected to impact local biodiversity. However, there is little evidence for LULC changes beyond the local scale to affect biodiversity across multiple functional groups of species, thus limiting our understanding of the causes of biodiversity change. Objectives Here we investigate whether landscape-wide changes in LULC, defined as either trends in or abrupt changes in magnitude of photosynthetic activity, are driving bird diversity change. Methods Linking 34 year (1984-2017) time series at 2745 breeding bird survey (BBS) routes across the conterminous United States of America with remotely-sensed Landsat imagery, we assessed for each year what proportion of the landscape surrounding each BBS route changed in photosynthetic activity and tested whether such concomitant or preceding landscape-wide changes explained changes in bird diversity, quantified as relative abundance (geometric mean) and assemblage composition (Bray-Curtis index). Results We found that changes in relative abundance was negatively, and assemblage composition positively, correlated with changes in photosynthetic activity within the wider landscape. Furthermore, landscape-wide changes in LULC in preceding years explained on average more variation in bird diversity change than concomitant change. Overall, landscape-wide changes in LULC failed to explain most of the variation in bird diversity change for most BBS routes regardless whether differentiated by functional groups or ecoregions. Conclusions Our analyses highlight the influence of preceding and concomitant landscape-wide changes in LULC on biodiversity.

TI  - Modelling Reservoir Chlorophyll-<i>a</i>, TSS, and Turbidity Using Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI Satellite Sensors with Empirical Multivariate Regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2A/MSI (S2A) and Landsat-8/OLI (L8) data products present a new frontier for the assessment and retrieval of optically active water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a(Chl-a), suspended particulate matter (TSS), and turbidity in reservoirs. However, because of their differences in spatial and spectral samplings, it is critical to evaluate how well the sensors are suited for the seamless generation of the water quality parameters (WQPs). This study presents results from the retrieval of the WQP in a reservoir from L8 and S2A optical sensors, after atmospheric correction and standardization through band adjustment. An empirical multivariate regression model (EMRM) algorithmic approach is proposed for the estimation of the water quality parameters in correlation within situlaboratory measurements. From the results, both sensors estimated Chl-aconcentrations withR2of greater than 70% from the visible green band for L8 and a combination of green and SWIR-1 bands for S2A. While the NMSE% was nearly the same for both sensors in Chl-aestimation, the RMSE was mu g/L and >10 mu g/L for L8 and S2A estimations of Chl-a, respectively. For TSS retrieval, L8 outperformed S2A by 31% in accuracy withR2>0.9from L8's red, blue, and green bands, as compared to0.47 <= R2 >= 0.61from S2A's red and NIR bands. The RMSE were the same as for Chl-a, and the NMSE% were both in the same range. Both sensors retrieved turbidity with high and nearly equal accuracy ofR2>70%from the visible and NIR bands, with equal RMSE at <10% NTU and NMAE% from S2A being higher by more than 30% as compared to L8's NMAE% at 15%. The study concluded that the higher performance accuracy of L8 is attributed to its higher SNR and spectral bandwidth placement as compared to S2A bands. Comparatively, S2A overestimated Chl-aand turbidity but performed equally well compared to OLI in the estimation of TSS. The results show that while absolute accuracy of retrieval of the WQPs still requires improvements, the developed algorithms are broadly able to discern the biooptical water quality in reservoirs.

TI  - Hydrogeochemical characteristics and water quality of Aji-Chay river, eastern catchment of Lake Urmia, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aji-Chay river is the most important river discharging into endangered Lake Urmia in NW of Iran. The present study investigates the hydrogeochemical characteristics and origin of dissolved ions in the Aji-Chay river and some of its tributaries passing through Tabriz plain which is located at the east side of Lake Urmia. For this purpose, 317 water samples were collected during 9 years (2005-2014) from four stations and clustered to nine groups using K-means algorithm. Major cations and anions were considered to distinguish the hydrogeochemical evolution of water. The Piper, Langelier-Ludwig and Stiff diagrams classified water samples into predominant Na-Cl endmember and Ca-HCO(3)only in the upstream zone. With respect to Gibbs diagrams, mineral saturation indices and geology of the area, water chemistry of the Aji-Chay river reflects that water-rock chemical interactions including dissolution/precipitation of carbonate and sulfate minerals known as dedolomitization and dissolution of evaporitic salts along the flow path are the dominant factors controlling the water chemistry; furthermore, evaporation, silicate weathering, and ion exchange reactions change the chemistry of water to some extent. Overall, water quality is evaluated as poor. Furthermore, intense halite dissolution increases Na concentration in water which in turn reduces its suitability for irrigation purposes.

TI  - What is the Cost-Effective Treatment for Melanoma Patients with a Positive Sentinel Node?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Survival for positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) patients does not differ between completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and nodal observation (OBS). However, treating these patients with CLND and checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab (PEM), improves outcomes. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OBS, CLND, and CLND with PEM (CLND-PEM) treatments. Methods A Markov model was designed to simulate treatment for a theoretical cohort of 1000 positive SLN patients per therapy with a 5-year follow-up period. An intervention was cost-effective if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among therapies was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results Compared with CLND or CLND-PEM, OBS resulted in fewer lymphedema cases but in more disease recurrences. Compared with OBS, CLND had higher costs and lower QALYs. Although CLND-PEM had a lower number of recurrences and deaths than OBS or CLND, it had higher costs and lower QALYs than OBS, and thus was not cost-effective. However, with the effects of CLND from CLND-PEM removed, allowing evaluation of PEM effects alone (PEM alone), the resulting QALYs were the highest, but PEM alone still was not cost-effective compared with OBS ($1.2 million per QALY). By reducing the drug cost to less than $14,404 per patient, PEM alone would become cost-effective. Conclusions Compared with CLND, CLND-PEM, and PEM alone, OBS was cost-effective for managing positive SLN patients. Although CLND-PEM and PEM alone result in fewer recurrences and deaths, these therapies were not cost-effective due to the quality-of-life decrement of CLND and the current high drug cost of PEM.

TI  - Optimizing breast cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses current and future challenges in the maintenance of surgical operating capacity. In the United Kingdom surgery has continued-in a reduced capacity-through the establishment of regional 'cancer hubs' using independent sector facilities to treat public healthcare patients. It is essential that these scarce operating facilities available are optimally utilized and that logistical challenges that result from remote operating away from the surgeon's primary hospital site are considered. These issues are best addressed through the application of currently available medical technology and enhanced training in advanced oncoplastic techniques, which extend the limits of breast conservation.

TI  - Impact of macroeconomic variables on corporate capital structure: a case of India
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the impact of macroeconomic variables on the capital structure of manufacturing companies in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs panel regression technique (random effects model) on a sample of 1,029 listed Indian manufacturing companies divided into two categories - large-size companies and mid-size companies for the last ten years from FY 2008-09 to FY 2017-18. Two separate models pertaining to long-term leverage (TTL_TNW ratio) and total leverage (TOL_TNW) have been examined. Findings Major findings show that macroeconomic variables play a relatively more important role in deciding the long-term debt component in the capital structure of the firms as compared to short-term loans. Similarly macroeconomic variables are found to be more significant in case of large-size companies as compared to mid-size companies. Also, there is a negative relationship between market capitalisation and leverage and bank credit and leverage, whereas money supply has a positive relationship with leverage. Research limitations/implications The study makes an important contribution to the existing literature in understanding better how macroeconomic variables play an important role in determining the capital structure of firms. In the present dynamic economic environment, such a study lays down the macro areas on which the academicians, policymakers and financial managers can focus with respect to corporate financing decisions. The firm-specific factors have not been taken into account. Inclusion of these factors will make the results more robust. Originality/value The study focusses on the impact of macroeconomic variables on the capital structure decision of the Indian firms. Several studies in this area have been done in the context of the developed countries. However, there are not many studies in the Indian context that examine the relationship between financing decision and macroeconomic variables. The results that have been derived in case of developed economies may not be extended in the Indian context as there are considerable differences across countries related to corporate and legal environment, taxation system, corporate governance laws, interest rate environments, banking system, sources of funds and so on. Therefore, it becomes important to focus on countries individually.

TI  - Coupled Adaptive Cycles of Shoreline Change and Households in Deltaic Bangladesh: Analysis of a 30-Year Shoreline Change Record and Recent Population Impacts
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of shoreline change and associated population impacts in deltaic Bangladesh. This region is among the world's most dynamic deltas due to monsoon precipitation that drives tremendous discharge and sediment volumes from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna drainage basin. Theoretically, it draws on the concept of adaptive cycles that theorizes systems transitioning through phases of growth, conservation, release (collapse), and reorganization, with a focus on the cycle's release (collapse) phase and coupled linkages between the natural system of shoreline change and social system of household behavior. We use Landsat imagery to produce and describe a thirty-year record of shoreline change for an 80-km stretch of the Lower Meghna estuary. Household survey data characterized population impacts and risk perception for a subregion with high erosion rates. Results identified significant space-time differences and patterns of shoreline change and population impacts consistent with the adaptive cycle. North, central, and south regions exhibited statistically significant differences in space-time patterns of shoreline change. Substantial numbers of households reported displacement due to riverbank erosion and high levels of experience and worry about future displacement. Results demonstrate how geospatial analysis of a multidecade record of shoreline change along with analysis of household survey data can identify regions most vulnerable to riverbank erosion with implications to inform mitigation and adaptation. This work adds empirical demonstration of coupled adaptive cycles to the literature. Limitations and complexities of the adaptive cycle framework are discussed.

TI  - Lymph Liquid Biopsy for Detection of Cancer Stem Cells
T2  - CYTOMETRY PART A
M3  - Article
AB  - Collection of a blood sample defined by the term "blood liquid biopsy" is commonly used to detect diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision-making markers of metastatic tumors including circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Many tumors also release CTCs and other markers into lymph fluid, but the utility of lymphatic markers largely remains unexplored. Here, we introduce lymph liquid biopsy through collection of peripheral (afferent) and central (thoracic duct [TD]) lymph samples and demonstrates its feasibility for detection of stem-like CTCs potentially responsible for metastasis development and tumor relapse. Stemness of lymphatic CTCs (L-CTCs) was determined by spheroid-forming assay in vitro. Simultaneously, we tested blood CTCs by conventional blood liquid biopsy, and monitored the primary tumor size, early metastasis in a sentinel lymph node (SLN) and distant metastasis in lungs. Using a mouse model at early melanoma stage with no distant metastasis, we identified stem-like L-CTCs in lymph samples from afferent lymphatic vessels. Since these vessels transport cells from the primary tumor to SLN, our finding emphasizes the significance of the lymphatic pathway in development of SLN metastasis. Surprisingly, in pre-metastatic disease, stem-like L-CTCs were detected in lymph samples from the TD, which directly empties lymph into blood circulation. This suggests a new contribution of the lymphatic system to initiation of distant metastasis. Integration of lymph and blood liquid biopsies demonstrated that all mice with early melanoma had stem-like CTCs in at least one of three samples (afferent lymph, TD lymph, and blood). At the stage of distant metastasis, spheroid-forming L-CTCs were detected in TD lymph, but not in afferent lymph. Altogether, our results demonstrated that lymph liquid biopsy and testing L-CTCs holds promise for diagnosis and prognosis of early metastasis.

TI  - Delineation of Copper Mineralization Zones at Wadi Ham, Northern Oman Mountains, United Arab Emirates Using Multispectral Landsat 8 (OLI) Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Copper deposits in the ultramafic rocks of the Semail ophiolite massifs is found to be enormous in the region of northern Oman Mountains, United Arab Emirates. For this study, samples of copper were gathered from 14 different sites in the investigation area and were analyzed in the laboratory using the X-ray diffraction, GER 3700 spectroradiometer, and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer. Detection and mapping of copper-bearing mineralized zones were carried out using different image processing approaches of minimum noise fraction, principal component analysis, decorrelation stretch, and band ratio which were applied on Landsat 8 (OLI) data. The spectra of malachite and azurite samples were characterized by broad absorption features in the visible and near infrared region (0.6-1.0 mu m). The results obtained from the principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, band ratio, decorrelation stretch, spectral reflectance analyses, and mineralogical and chemical analyses were found to be similar. Thus, it can be concluded that multispectral Landsat 8 data are useful in the detection iron ore deposits in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Sentinel-1 TOPS co-registration over low-coherence areas and its application to velocity estimation using the all pairs shortest path algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The C-band Sentinel-1 A/B satellites in TOPS mode provide unprecedented opportunities for continuous radar mapping of the earth with enhanced revisit frequency. The reliability for routine operational services relies on a very stringent azimuth co-registration accuracy. However, while the enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) technique achieves a co-registration accuracy of better than 0.001 pixels, the accuracy might still be degraded over low-coherence areas due to fast decorrelation. When TOPS time series data are available, the abrupt loss of coherence further affects the estimation accuracy of the network ESD. I integrate a double sample over the burst overlap region with an ESD estimator to reduce the ESD phase error and simultaneously mitigate the abrupt loss of coherence in the time series using the all pairs shortest path algorithm. I further use this algorithm to create a spatio-temporal network of co-registered Sentinel-1 SAR stacks for line-of-sight (LOS) velocity estimation over low-coherence areas. I perform InSAR time series analysis and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using data acquired from descending tracks over representative low-coherence regions in south-western China. For those images suffering from significant low coherence, this method can achieve a better co-registration accuracy than those obtained from the previous network ESD method. By cross-validating descending COSMO-SkyMed data, a 39% uncertainty reduction in the estimated LOS velocity can be achieved when applying a co-registered Sentinel-1 stack with high accuracy and spatio-temporal network evolution.

TI  - Assessment of diagnostic value of fluorescent lymphography-guided lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Indocyanine green fluorescent lymphography helps visualize the lymphatic drainage pattern in gastric cancer; however, it is unknown whether fluorescent lymphography visualizes all metastatic lymph nodes. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of fluorescent lymphography to detect metastatic lymph node stations and lymph nodes and the risk of false-negative findings. Methods Patients with clinical T1-4a gastric cancer were included. Indocyanine green was peritumorally injected the day prior to surgery by endoscopy. Gastrectomy with systematic D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy was performed. Stations and lymph nodes were retrieved at the back-table using near-infrared imaging and classified as "fluorescent" or "non-fluorescent" and later matched with histopathological findings. Results Among 592 patients who underwent minimally invasive gastrectomy from September 2013 until December 2016, lymph node metastases were present in 150. The sensitivity of fluorescent lymphography in detecting all metastatic lymph node stations was 95.3% (143/150 patients), with a false-negative rate of 4.7% (7/150 patients) and the sensitivity in detecting all metastatic lymph nodes was 81.3% (122/150 patients). The negative predictive value was 99.3% for non-fluorescent stations and 99.2% for non-fluorescent LNs. For detecting all metastatic LN stations, subgroup analysis revealed 100% sensitivity for pT1a, 96.8% for pT1b, 100% for pT2, 91.3% for pT3, and 93.6% for pT4a tumors. Conclusions Fluorescent lymphography-guided lymphadenectomy can be a useful method for radical lymphadenectomy by facilitating the complete dissection of all potentially positive LN stations. Fluorescent lymphography-guided lymphadenectomy appears to be a reasonable alternative to conventional systematic lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.

TI  - New Insights on Land Use, Land Cover, and Climate Change in Human-Environment Dynamics of the Equatorial Andes
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide new insights on land use and climate change in human-environment dynamics of the equatorial Andes. We focused on two provinces (Cotopaxi and Napo) and three communities of Ecuador characterized by similar land tenure regimes but different socioenvironmental contexts. We integrate satellite data classifications and statistical analyses, longitudinal downscaled climate modeling, and interviews with smallholder farmers, to analyze environmental changes between 1991 and 2017, local impacts, and local adaptations. In Cotopaxi, our results reveal a significant growth of forest plantations, irrigated agriculture, and greenhouse infrastructure associated with specific topographic and soil conditions, land and water availability and accessibility, and changing economic opportunities. In Napo, the reduction of montane forest vegetation and expansion of shrub vegetation are noteworthy. These changes are likely linked to feedback mechanisms between conservation and development strategies, exacerbated by contemporary climate change and increased natural hazards risk. Our study shows that mean annual temperature in the region has increased, seasonal change has intensified, annual precipitation has decreased, and the number of frost-free days has increased in relation to the normal period (1961-1990). Our study supports the notion that wide-ranging human adaptations linked to climate and land use changes, market elements (including livelihood transitions, occupational multiplicity, and production rationales), and complex knowledge systems (both indigenous and nonindigenous) are critical to the sustainability of smallholder farmers in the Andes.

TI  - Rewilding of large herbivore communities in high elevation Puna: geographic segregation and no evidence of positive effects on peatland productivity
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past decades, the Argentine Puna (a subtropical high elevation desert of c. 14 million hectares) has been going through a process of "rewilding" of large herbivore communities. In response to rural population outmigration and resulting livestock reduction accompanied by protection measures, large wild herbivores such as vicunas increased. To explore the ecological consequences of this transition, we analysed the spatial patterns of wild herbivores and livestock in relation to human settlements, and we estimated the changes in vegetation productivity of peatlands, using NDVI derived from MODIS satellite images between 2001 and 2012. Peatlands are key ecosystems in high elevation deserts; they regulate water and carbon fluxes and provide most forage for livestock and wildlife. A field survey of 50 peatlands revealed that travel time from human settlements was positively correlated with the wild herbivore abundance, and negatively correlated with livestock abundance (especially sheep and goats). Thus, it is a good indicator of livestock use. At the regional scale, after controlling for the physical and climatic variables of the 8134 peatlands, accessibility from human settlements explained less than 0.1% of mean and interannual NDVI variability. These results provide no evidence of livestock-induced degradation. Furthermore, likely due to rainfall increase, peatlands showed an overall positive NDVI trend between 2001 and 2012, but isolated peatlands showed comparatively more negative NDVI trends during the same period, possibly associated with increased wildlife herbivory. Similar rewilding processes could occur in many mountain regions undergoing decreasing human population and marginal land uses. Our study suggests that traditional management could contribute to the productivity, stability, and resilience of peatlands.

TI  - Remote sensing data fusion using fruit fly optimization
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The image fusion (pan-sharpening) aims to generate a multispectral image with the maximum of spatial details of the panchromatic image and the spectral characteristics of the multispectral images. The generalized intensity-hue-saturation (GIHS) can produce fused images with high spatial details, but the spectral characteristics of the fused images need improvement. This article introduces an adaptive fusion method based on GIHS using the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) in two stages. First, we suggest to use it to compute the optimal band weights which reduces the large difference between the intensity component and the panchromatic image. Second, we propose to apply the FOA to compute the modulation parameters that estimate the amount of spatial details to be added to the multispectral images. In this regard, an objective function that combines the coefficient of the correlation (CC) with the spatial coefficient of the correlation (SCC) is suggested. This method is tested on Pleiades, IKONOS, and ALSAT-2A images and we compared it with some existing fusion methods. The CC, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Quality with No Reference (QNR), the Relative Global Synthesis Error Metric (ERGAS) and the Relative Average Spectral Error (RASE) are used for quantitative analysis. The best values of CC, RMSE, ERGAS, RASE and QNR on all used datasets are given by the proposed method. The quantitative results and the visual analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the four comparison methods in terms of spatial and spectral quality.

TI  - Estimating microbial mat biomass in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica using satellite imagery and ground surveys
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial mat communities are the main drivers of primary productivity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. These microbial communities form laminar mats on desert pavement surfaces adjacent to glacial meltwater streams, ponds, and lakes. The low-density nature of these communities and their patchy distribution make assessments of distribution, biomass, and productivity challenging. We used satellite imagery coupled with in situ surveying, imaging, and sampling to systematically estimate microbial mat biomass in selected wetland regions in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. On January 19th, 2018, the WorldView-2 multispectral satellite acquired an image of our study areas, where we surveyed and sampled seven 100 m(2)plots of microbial mats for percent ground cover, ash-free dry mass (AFDM), and pigment content (chlorophyll-a, carotenoids, and scytonemin). Multispectral analyses revealed spectral signatures consistent with photosynthetic activity (relatively strong reflection at near-infrared wavelengths and relatively strong absorption at visible wavelengths), with average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of 0.09 to 0.28. Strong correlations of microbial mat ground cover (R-2 = 0.84), biomass (R-2 = 0.74), chlorophyll-a content (R-2 = 0.65), and scytonemin content (R-2 = 0.98) with logit transformed NDVI values demonstrate that satellite imagery can detect both the presence of microbial mats and their key biological properties. Using the NDVI-biomass correlation we developed, we estimate carbon (C) stocks of 21,715 kg (14.7 g C m(-2)) in the Canada Glacier Antarctic Specially Protected Area, with an upper and lower limit of 74,871 and 6312 kg of C, respectively.

TI  - Flash flood impacts of Hurricane Otto and hydrometeorological risk mapping in Costa Rica
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are one of the most damaging natural hazards in tropics. Seasonal and extraordinary rainfall recurrently trigger flash floods in Costa Rica. Hurricane Otto was the first reported hurricane to have ever passed through Costa Rica. The phenomenon resulted in losses amounting to 190 million US$, leaving four casualties and ca. 69 million US$ of losses in Upala municipality in northern Costa Rica, alone. On November 24, 2016, the passage of Hurricane Otto produced similar to 300 mm of rain over the study region in 6 h. We carried out a hydrometeorological risk assessment based on population census minimum geostatistical units to present a spatially distributed risk matrix assessment. In addition, we applied an S1 GRD (Ground Range Detected) and VV polarization to Sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and WorldView-3 and WorldView-4 images to determine the flash-flooded areas just after Hurricane Otto's impact in the Zapote River, Cabeza de Leon and Guacalillo sub-basins mainly in Upala municipality. Consequently, we compared the flash-flooded areas with the different previous hydrometeorological risk zones. Flash floods affected similar to 74 km(2) and 56% of these areas coincided with high-risk zones. The results and methodology of this study can be useful to assess extraordinary hydrometeorological hazards in developing and tropical countries.

TI  - A new Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 cloud flagging method and rapid retrieval of marine boundary layer cloud properties
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) carries a hyperspectral A-band sensor that can obtain information about cloud geometric thickness (H). The OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX product retrieved H with the aid of collocated CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) lidar data to identify suitable clouds and provide a priori cloud top pressure (P-top). This collocation is no longer possible, since CALIPSO's coordination flying with OCO-2 has ended, so here we introduce a new cloud flagging and a priori assignment using only OCO-2 data, restricted to ocean footprints where solar zenith angle < 45 degrees. Firstly, a multi-layer perceptron network was trained to identify liquid clouds over the ocean with sufficient optical depth (tau > 1) for a valid retrieval, and agreement with MODIS-CALIPSO (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is 90.0 %. Secondly, we developed a lookup table to simultaneously retrieve cloud tau, effective radius (re) and P-top from A-band and CO2 band radiances, with the intention that these will act as the a priori state estimate in a future retrieval. Median P-top difference vs. CALIPSO is 12 hPa with an inter-decile range of [-11; 87] hPa, substantially better than the MODIS-CALIPSO range of [-83,81] hPa. The MODIS-OCO-2 tau difference is 0.8[-3.8,6.9], and r(e) is -0.3 [-2.8,2.1] mu m. The tau difference is due to optically thick and horizontally heterogeneous cloud scenes. As well as an improved passive P-top retrieval, this a priori information will allow for a purely OCO-2-based Bayesian retrieval of cloud droplet number concentration (N-d). Finally, our cloud flagging procedure may also be useful for future partial-column above-cloud CO2 abundance retrievals.

TI  - US East Coast synthetic aperture radar wind atlas for offshore wind energy
T2  - WIND ENERGY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offshore wind atlas of the US East Coast from Georgia to the Canadian border. Images from RADARSAT-1, Envisat, and Sentinel-1A/B are processed to wind maps using the geophysical model function (GMF) CMOD5.N. Extensive comparisons with 6008 collocated buoy observations of the wind speed reveal that biases of the individual systems range from -0.8 to 0.6 m s(-1). Unbiased wind retrievals are crucial for producing an accurate wind atlas, and intercalibration of the SAR observations is therefore applied. Wind retrievals from the intercalibrated SAR observations show biases in the range of to -0.2 to 0.0 m s(-1), while at the same time improving the root-mean-squared error from 1.67 to 1.46 m s(-1). The intercalibrated SAR observations are, for the first time, aggregated to create a wind atlas at the height 10 m a.s.l. (above sea level). The SAR wind atlas is used as a reference to study wind resources derived from the Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK), which is based on 7 years of modelling output from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Comparisons focus on the spatial variation in wind resources and show that model outputs lead to lower coastal wind speed gradients than those derived from SAR. Areas designated for offshore wind development by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are investigated in more detail; the wind resources in terms of the mean wind speed show spatial variations within each designated area between 0.3 and 0.5 m s(-1) for SAR and less than 0.2 m s(-1) for the WTK. Our findings indicate that wind speed gradients and variations might be underestimated in mesoscale model outputs along the US East Coast.

TI  - Impact ofTumor-InfiltratingLymphocytes on Overall Survival in Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. As the clinical course can be variable, prognostic markers are needed to better stratify patients. Prior literature, composed of small series with limited sample size, has demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are an important prognostic marker in MCC. To validate these findings on a population level, we sought to analyze and report the prognostic value of TILs in a large national data set. Materials and Methods A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted of patients with nonmetastatic MCC from 2010 to 2015 using the National Cancer Database. Individual variables trending toward significance using a univariable analysis were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to assess their independent effect on overall survival (OS). TILs were subclassified into none, nonbrisk, and brisk and the survival analysis was performed. Propensity score-weighted multivariable analysis (PS MVA) was performed to adjust for additional confounding. Results A total of 2,182 patients met inclusion criteria: 611 (28.0%) were identified as having TILs present, and 1,571 (72.0%) had TILs absent in the tumor. On MVA, subdivision of TIL status into nonbrisk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.750; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.602-0.933) and brisk (HR, 0.499; 95% CI, 0.338-0.735) was associated with incrementally improved OS compared with no TILs. The association of nonbrisk and brisk TILs with improved OS was retained on PS MVA (Nonbrisk: HR, 0.720; 95% CI, 0.550-0.944; Brisk: HR, 0.483; 95% CI, 0.286-0.814). Conclusion The presence of nonbrisk and brisk TILs is associated with incrementally improved OS in patients with nonmetastatic MCC in a large national data set. This pathologic feature can aid with risk stratification, estimation of prognosis, and, importantly, decision-making with respect to treatment intensification in high-risk patients. Implications for Practice Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous malignancy with variable clinical course. Prognostic markers are needed to better risk stratify patients. We present the largest retrospective observational cohort study of patients with nonmetastatic MCC using the National Cancer Database. Our analysis demonstrates an association between increasing degrees of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and incrementally improved survival. These conclusions improve pathologic risk stratification, and decision-making with respect to treatment intensification. Intensification may include adjuvant radiation therapy to the primary site after wide excision despite small tumor size, to the nodal basin in sentinel lymph node-negative patients, or offering closer follow-up.

T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compounds of ethanol and ammonia have been known for over a century but no structural characterization has been carried out. Solid crystalline specimens of molecular ethanol mono-ammoniate and ethanol hemi-ammoniate were prepared by flash freezing of stoichiometric liquids in liquid nitrogen followed by annealing between 175 and 195 K. High-resolution neutron powder diffraction measurements were used to determine the complete structures of the two compounds. Both are triclinic (P (1) over bar, Z = 2): ethanol mono-ammoniate is characterized by linear tapes of four-sided hydrogen-bonded rings, which extend along the crystal's b-axis; the ethanol hemi-ammoniate structure is defined by sheets (in the crystal's a - b plane) comprised of two different types of four- and six-sided H-bonded rings. Measurements collected as a function of temperature provide a precise determination of the thermal expansion of the two ethanol ammoniates and solid deutero-ammonia. Density functional theory calculations yield insights into the response of each structure to hydrostatic stress, including a proton transfer to form either wholly ionic ammonium ethoxide crystals or ionic co-crystals of ethanol ammonium ethoxide. The switch from molecular to ionic co-crystal in ethanol hemi-ammoniate may occur on cooling at ambient pressure, with kinetic frustration due to the low temperature of the transition. Proton transfer at ambient pressure, or at modest impact shock pressures, suggests that there may be extensive ammonium salt formation amongst compounds of the simplest alcohols. This may represent an important additional mechanism for the generation of NH4+ spectroscopic signatures in remotely sensed data from interstellar, cometary, and planetary ices.

T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is commonly used to investigate lymphadenopathy of suspected metastatic origin. While diagnostic accuracy of FNA for lymph node disease is well described, the relationship between node size, percent tumor replacement, and size of metastatic deposit with diagnostic accuracy is less well documented. Methods All axillary lymph nodes undergoing ultrasound-guided FNA for suspected breast metastases were correlated with subsequent surgical excision specimens. FNAs were judged as positive or negative for malignancy and the percent of false negative FNAs was correlated with node size, percent tumor replacement and size of metastatic deposit Results Sensitivities were calculated for nodes greater than 15 mm (92%), nodes 11 to 14.9 mm (83%), nodes 7 to 10.9 mm (61%), and for nodes less than 7 mm (60%). Sensitivity increases with increasing node size (P= .001). Percent tumor replacement correlated with sensitivity: 90% or greater replacement (85%) 60% to 89.9% replacement (75%), 40% to 59.9% replacement (75%) and less than 39.9% replacement (64%)(P< .001). Metastases size correlated with sensitivity: metastases greater than 10 mm (94%), 6 to 9.9 mm (70%), 4 to 5.9 mm (54%), and less than 4 mm (72%). Conclusions Percentage of false negative FNAs associate with investigation of metastatic disease correlates with node size, size of metastatic deposit and percentage of nodes replaced by tumor. Lymph nodes smaller than 7 mm, deposit diameter less than 6 mm and percentage replacement of less than 40% have the highest percentage of false negative results.

TI  - Extracapsular Spread in Melanoma Lymphadenopathy: Prognostic Implications, Classification, and Management
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Extracapsular spread (ECS) is recognized to be a high-risk factor in melanoma patients with macrometastatic (N+) nodal disease; however, ECS risk in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, micrometastatic stage III disease is ambiguous. Objective The aim of this study was to examine ECS incidence and its prognostic significance. Methods A two-center, retrospective analysis of all patients with micro/macrometastatic lymphadenopathy undergoing nodal surgery from 2008 to 2014 was performed. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, nodal ECS status, and patient outcomes were collected. Results Overall, 515 patients with nodal disease were identified (males/females = 277/238); median age was 63 years (range 17-94). There was an increased frequency of ECS disease in N+ disease compared with SLN+ disease (52.4% vs. 16.2%;p < 0.0001). The absolute disease-specific survival (DSS) difference for SLN+ patients was approximately 30% at 10 years (66.2% vs. 37.2%;p < 0.0001), and the prognosis of SLN+/ECS+ patients was identical to N+/ECS- patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ECS status was an independent prognostic indicator for DSS (hazard ratio 2.47, 95% confidence interval 1.87-3.26;p < 0.0001) in patients with SLN+ disease. There were significant differences in nodal burden according to ECS status between the SLN+ and N+ subgroups suggestive of differing biology in ECS+ tumors. Conclusion We found that ECS is a significant DSS, progression-free survival, and overall survival indicator in SLN+ and N+ disease. We demonstrated that ECS upstages stage III disease, similar to ulceration in primary melanoma (stage I/II disease). A simplified staging system substituting ECS for N stage accurately stages patients according to prognosis.

TI  - Visible and Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy for Assessment of Soil Properties in the Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to predict soil properties using visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least square regression (PLSR) modeling. Special emphasis was given to evaluating effect of pre-processing methods on prediction accuracy and important wavelengths. A total of 114 samples were collected and involved in chemical and spectral analyzes. PLSR model of each soil property was calibrated for all pre-processing methods using all samples, and leave-one-out cross-validation was used to make comparisons between them. Then, PLSR model of each best pre-processing method was calibrated using a 75% of all samples and correspondingly validated with the remaining a 25%. Model accuracy was evaluated based on coef?cient of determination (R-2), root mean-squared errors (RMSE), and residual prediction deviations (RPD). The high correlation coefficients were found between the tested soil properties and reflectance spectra. The pre-processing methods considerably improved prediction accuracy and filtering methods outperformed linearization methods, and the latter outperformed normalization methods. The performance of cross-validation, calibration and independent validation was similar. An excellent prediction (RPD>2.5) model was obtained for soil organic carbon (SOC) and calcium-carbonate (CaCO3), good quantitative (2.0< RPD<2.5) prediction for sand, silt, and clay, fair prediction (1.4< RPD<1.8) for pH, and poor prediction (1.0< RPD<1.4) for hygroscopic water content (WC). Important wavelengths varied depending on soil property, but some wavelengths were common. This study can be a precursor to building a pioneering soil spectral database, calibrating satellite data, and hyperspectral image mapping of soils as well as digital soil mapping, environmental, and erosion modeling in the Caucasus Mountains.

TI  - A data-driven approach for bare surface soil moisture estimation using Sentinel-1 SAR data and ground observations
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable in the agriculture system. Likewise, accurate information on soil moisture is needed for the effective modeling of many hydrological and climatological processes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operates with the competence to acquire data in any weather condition, has been proved to be sensitive to surface soil moisture. This study has attempted to establish simple experimental relationships to estimate volumetric bare surface soil moisture (sm(v)) using the SAR satellite-based radar backscatter values (sigma degrees). In this study, the in-situsm(v)measurements of two study sites in the United States were obtained from the SoilSCAPE project whereas sigma degrees data for the same study sites were obtained from the C-band Sentinel-1 satellite. Initially, four experiments were designed based on various radar configurations i.e., combination of polarization and incidence angle(s) at an individual or combined node(s) of each study site. Following this, the statistical analysis in each experiment was carried out using the high volume data i.e., the long-term time-series sigma degrees and in-situsm(v)that were clustered in these radar configurations. Subsequently, the relationships were established on the basis of outcome of each experiment. Based on the detailed analysis, it was found that out of four experiments, only one experiment outcome in terms of correlations statistics, for a particular radar configuration and study site, was found to be significant and accepted for model development. The derived model was applied and validated over the demo farm located in Pune, India. The comparison between the estimated and in-situsm(v)measurements shows good agreement, with a mapping accuracy of about 8% observed with the radar configuration- vertical-vertical (VV) polarization with a 43 degrees incidence angle.

TI  - Type specific seroprevalence of bluetongue virus during 2017-2018 in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states of India
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue (BT) is one of the important viral diseases of domestic and wild ruminants, especially small ruminants such as sheep. Out of the 29 BTV serotypes prevalent in the world, at least 24 of the serotypes are reported in India, either by virus isolation or serology. To better understand the seroprevalence of BTV, we conducted a comprehensive study in the main reservoir hosts of BTV, i.e., cattle and buffaloes of different age groups in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states of India where the disease is majorly prevalent. A total of 321 blood samples collected from cattle and buffaloes during 2017-2018 were tested for group-specific BTV seroprevalence by c-ELISA, followed by type specific seroprevalence (against BTV-1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16, and 24) by serum neutralization test. Of the 311 BTV seropositive samples, 112, 98, 102, 127, 2, 113, 160, and 5 samples neutralized BTV-1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16, and 24, respectively. Twenty-nine samples could not neutralize any of the tested BTV serotypes. Majority of the sera neutralized more than one serotype, up to a maximum of six serotypes. Major finding of the study is detection of BTV serotypes not included in the commercial pentavalent inactivated vaccine. Regular surveillance of circulating serotypes, especially in sentinel reservoir hosts throughout the country can help in designing better multivalent vaccines with suitable vaccine strains, for specific geographic regions.

TI  - Characteristics of the Reanalysis and Satellite-Based Surface Net Radiation Data in the Arctic
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compared four net radiation products: the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate (ERA5), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF), and Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX), based on ground observation data and intercomparison data. ERA5 showed the highest accuracy, followed by EBAF, GEWEX, and NCEP. When analyzing the validation grid, ERA5 showed the most similar data distribution to ground observation data. Different characteristics were observed between the reanalysis data and satellite data. In the case of satellite-based data, the net radiation value tended to increase at high latitudes. Compared with the reanalysis data, Greenland and the central Arctic appeared to be overestimated. All data were highly correlated, with a difference of 6-21 W/m(2)among the products examined in this study. Error was attributed mainly to difficulties in predicting long-term climate change and having to combine net radiation data from several sources. This study highlights criteria that may be helpful in selecting data for future climate research models of this region.

TI  - Modelling historic and future land use/land cover changes and their impact on wetland area in Shashe sub-catchment, Zimbabwe
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use current and historic land use/land cover (LULC) changes to predict future LULC using coupled Cellular Automata-Markov chain model. Landsat time series data for the month of June were used to determine LULC changes for the years 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015 using random forest classification system in R. We then used Markov Chain algorithm with multiple perceptron in land change modeler to simulate future LULC dynamics for the years 2025, 2035 and 2045. Contingent valuation method was employed to estimate ecological value of wetlands. Results for the LULC analysis for the period between 1984 and 2015 show a decline in woodland and wetland area owing to natural and human factors. We noted a reduced net change for grassland, woodland and mountain vegetation covers losing by - 4%, - 5.2%, - 2% and - 4% change, respectively. While, riverine vegetation, crop field and rock outcrop gained by 0.5%, 4% and 10.2%, respectively. A notable dramatic decline in wetland area was recorded between 1995 and 2005 losing about 125.53 ha, which could be attributed to recurrent droughts of 1995, 1998, 2002 and 2005. Major conversions were from wetland cover to crop fields suggesting agricultural encroachment onto the wetland area. Wetland area, thus, significantly decreased by 6% (p < 0.05) amounting to 236.52 ha in the last 30 years. Coupled CA-Markov chain model results for the years 2025, 2035 and 2045 predicted a further increase in cropfield at the expense of woodland and wetland area. In particular, wetland area is expected to further shrink by 46% (72.67) by the year 2045. Contingent valuation results show that every respondent concurs that wetlands have deteriorated to a very bad state in comparison to their state in the twentieth century. The cited reduced wetland health, biodiversity of both flora and fauna, water quality and quantity and general wetland area. The present state is estimated to be far less than 10% of the total value of wetlands 20 years ago. Quantifying such future wetland area changes is important not only for pure-scientific purposes but also for appropriately developing locally relevant and sustainable management strategies for wetland conservation.

TI  - Fuzzy clustering analysis of comprehensive hand of polyester fabric based on the CHES-FY system
T2  - TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Polyester fabrics are attributed with various performances and are currently applied widely in textiles. This necessitates a quick and effective selection process to choose polyester fabrics to correspond with engineers' designs for industrial textiles. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to present the comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns (CHES-FY), which has been specially developed to measure the basic handle of textile materials, including softness, stiffness, smoothness and tightness. Several kinds of polyester fabrics were chosen to undergo subjective evaluation and testing by the CHES-FY system, and were assigned into corresponding clusters by the K-means cluster method. The basic hand indexes of polyester fabric were featured. Comparisons between subjective judgments and the objective K-means cluster method were conducted. Experimental results show that a good correlation exists between subjective judgment and the objective cluster method, indicating that the four basic hand indexes measured by the CHES-FY system can be utilized to characterize the comprehensive hand of industrial polyester fabrics, and that the CHES-FY system can be used to discriminate categories of polyester fabrics.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated with increased cost in higher risk thin melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) be discussed with patients with thin melanoma at higher risk for lymph node metastasis (T1b or T1a with positive deep margins, lymphovascular invasion, or high mitotic index). We examined the association between SLNB and resource utilization in this cohort. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients that underwent wide local excision for higher risk thin melanomas from 2009 to 2018 at a tertiary care center. Patients who underwent SLNB were compared to those who did not undergo SLNB with regard to resource utilization, including total hospital cost. Results A total of 70 patients were included in the analysis and 50 patients (71.4%) underwent SLNB. SLNB was associated with increased hospital costs ($6700 vs. $3767; p < .01) and increased operative time (68.5 vs. 36.0 min;p < .01). This cost difference persisted in multivariable regression (p < .01). Of patients who underwent successful SLN mapping, 3 out of 49 patients had a positive SLN (6.1%). The cost to identify a single positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) was $47,906. Conclusion In patients with a higher risk of thin melanoma, SLNB is associated with increased cost despite a low likelihood of SLN positivity. These data better inform patient-provider discussions as the role of SLNB in thin melanoma evolves.

TI  - The rise and fall of empathy in an era of financial crisis: rethinking the neoliberal imaginary
T2  - JOURNAL FOR CULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to place the explosion of popular interest in empathy within a specific historic context: the financial crisis of 2008. The financial crisis, and the years of economic recession that followed, led to a general discontent with the neoliberal system. The paper argues that key texts of the post-crisis discourse of empathy tapped into this malaise by advancing a radical critique of the neoliberal worldview on the basis of care theory. However, the embrace of global empathy ironically became entangled with the ethos of neoliberal globalism that it sought to supersede. The post-crisis vision of an empathetic world thus ended up reinforcing the very paradigm it critiqued. The paper posits that the awkward alliance between the ethos of empathy and the neoliberal imaginary may explain the recent backlash of popular aversion to the discourse of empathy and its rejection in present-day politics.

TI  - Delineating changes in soil erosion risk zones using RUSLE model based on confusion matrix for the Urmodi river watershed, Maharashtra, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil loss by water erosion is a common type of land degradation issue in the hilly regions of the world. The present study investigates the soil erosion risk due to change in Land Use Land Cover (LULC) brought in by the construction of dam in a hilly watershed of the River Urmodi embracing Kaas Plateau, a world heritage site. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was used with change detection analysis for soil erosion estimation. Thematic layers required for the computation of factors required in RUSLE were gathered using remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Science techniques. The changes in LULC affect the soil erosion phenomena and therefore, the present study analyzes drastic alteration in the hydrological nature of the watershed brought by the construction of reservoir through damming the Urmodi River. For assessment of the impact of the dam we have used RS data with 30 m spatial resolution, which includes Digital Elevation Model and Landsat TM and Landsat 8 bands. Using RUSLE, soil risk zone was mapped and the Change Detection in zones were computed. The very simple logic of 'soil erosion class as a type of land cover' was successfully applied to perform the change transition for the Urmodi river watershed. Confusion matrix technique used for analyzing the change, has the ability to show the previous and next condition of zone type very affectively with good precision. Along with Change Detection technique, soil erosion class transition operation was also performed to assess the conversion of zones. This gave the important output regarding increased conversion from very slight to very severe risk zone by 70.22 km(2). The investigation concludes that there was extensive change in very severe (> 80 ton ha(-1)year(-1)) soil vulnerable risk zone in the last 17 years with the rise of 14.87%. The conversion of lower risk category areas to higher risk category areas of soil erosion was detected all over the watershed. Undertaking such studies revealed the changes brought in the soil erosion susceptible zones by building of dams. This study will be a crucial help to policy and decision makers for proper planning of watershed with consideration to LULC in the event of dam construction on the rivers flowing in hilly terrain.

TI  - Object-Based Image Analysis Using Harmonic Analysis on A High-Spatial Resolution Satellite Image
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to extract biophysical and structural properties of features in digital images is an important goal in remote sensing. Delineating the boundaries of image features, and building meaningful numerical descriptors of them based on their geometric shape, are both challenging tasks that are necessary to identify shape pattern in image data. This study seeks to evaluate and compare the performance of Fourier harmonic descriptors against dimensionless ratios of image-object shape for characterizing objects in image classification training samples. We took 150 random samples of three different object types - forest canopies, residential houses, and buildings (50 samples each) - from a high spatial-resolution satellite image (WorldView-2) covering a portion of the southern end of California's Great Central Valley. To identify patterns in object shapes and perform object classification, we followed three steps. First, we performed image segmentation through an object-based image analysis (OBIA) method based on the Watershed Transform. We then carried out shape characterization using Fourier harmonics to measure variation in the silhouette of different object types. Finally, we compared and evaluated the performance of dimensionless ratios with Fourier descriptors by classifying different object shapes and assessing the accuracy of each method. Multinomial regression models were fitted to compare the accuracy and error of the two methods. Classification accuracy assessment was addressed utilizing hypothesis tests and significance of the likelihood ratio (LR) test and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Dimensionless ratios and Fourier harmonics had similar, moderate accuracy of 70% and 73.33%, respectively, but only four harmonics were required to achieve the best model fit, and six were needed for dimensionless ratios. Harmonic analysis provides quantitative descriptions of object shapes allowing pattern characterizations that can improve a supervised classification.

TI  - An Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search Algorithm for the Satellite Data Transmission Scheduling Problem
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite establishes a satellite ground station to satellite link with a ground station to complete data transmission. However, in China, satellite ground stations only exist within the country. With the rapid increase in the number of satellites, effectively dispatching satellite communications and maximizing the performance of ground stations are necessary. We propose a heuristic adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (H-ALNS) to solve the satellite data transmission scheduling (SDTS) problem. The algorithm includes two heuristic rules for generating the initial scheme and the conflict reduction process after updating the neighborhood. A heuristic task assignment method is used to select the execution time window and position for the task sequence. The adaptive operator is used to update the delete operator and insert operator weights into the H-ALNS. The quality of the generated planning scheme improved through continuous neighborhood destruction and repair. Through experimental analysis, the algorithm we propose is feasible for solving SDTS problems and surpasses the planning results acquired using other comparison algorithms. The H-ALNS has good prospects for practical engineering applications.

TI  - Metastatic status of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer determined with photoacoustic microscopy via dual-targeting nanoparticles.
T2  - Light, science & applications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is critical to guide the treatment of breast cancer. However, distinguishing metastatic SLNs from normal and inflamed lymph nodes (LNs) during surgical resection remains a challenge. Here, we report a CD44 and scavenger receptor class B1 dual-targeting hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (5K-HA-HPPS) loaded with the near-infra-red fluorescent dye DiR-BOA for SLN imaging in breast cancer. The small sized (~40nm) self-assembled 5K-HA-HPPSs accumulated rapidly in the SLNs after intradermal injection. Compared with normal popliteal LNs (N-LN), there were ~3.2-fold and ~2.4-fold increases in fluorescence intensity in tumour metastatic SLNs (T-MLN) and inflamed LNs (Inf-LN), respectively, 6h after nanoparticle inoculation. More importantly, photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) of 5K-HA-HPPS showed a significantly distinct distribution in T-MLN compared with N-LN and Inf-LN. Signals were mainly distributed at the centre of T-MLN but at the periphery of N-LN and Inf-LN. The ratio of PA intensity (R) at the centre of the LNs compared with that at the periphery was 5.93±0.75 for T-MLNs of the 5K-HA-HPPS group, which was much higher than that for the Inf-LNs (R=0.2±0.07) and N-LNs (R=0.45±0.09). These results suggest that 5K-HA-HPPS injection combined with PAM provides a powerful tool for distinguishing metastatic SLNs from pLNs and inflamed LNs, thus guiding the removal of SLNs during breast cancer surgery.

AB  - Winter wheat is a staple food crop for most of the world's population, and the area and spatial distribution of winter wheat are key elements in estimating crop production and ensuring food security. However, winter wheat planting areas contain substantial spatial heterogeneity with mixed pixels for coarse- and moderate-resolution satellite data, leading to large errors in crop acreage estimation. This study has developed a phenology-based approach using moderate-resolution (1 km per pixel) satellite data to estimate sub-pixel planting fractions of winter wheat. Based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observations, the unique characteristics of winter wheat with high vegetation index values at the heading stage (May) and low values at the ripening stage (June) were investigated. The differences in vegetation index between heading and ripening stages increased with the planting fraction of winter wheat, and therefore the planting fractions were estimated by comparing the NDVI differences of a given pixel with those of predetermined pure winter wheat and non-winter wheat pixels. This approach was evaluated using aerial images and agricultural statistical data in an intensive agricultural region, Shandong Province in North China. The method explained 85% and 60% of the spatial variation in municipal- and county-level statistical data, respectively. More importantly, the predetermined pure winter wheat and non-winter wheat pixels can be automatically identified using MODIS data according to their NDVI differences, which strengthens the potential to use this method at regional and global scales without any field observations as references.

TI  - A novel approach for surface water quality modelling based on Landsat-8 tasselled cap transformation

AB  - Updating the physicochemical properties of surface water is important to water quality researchers and decision-makers. Routine surface water quality monitoring methods are inadequate; whereas, remote sensing (RS) is a source of processing data in both spatial and temporal domains. However, RS is a good tool of monitoring freshwater ecosystems, accurate modelling of surface water quality parameters from satellite imagery is still a challenging task. High correlation between the adjacent satellite signals, which creates redundancy, is one of the main challenges that negatively affect the stability of the developed models. Therefore, this paper focuses on the development of a novel approach for modelling concentrations of both turbidity (T) and total suspended solids (TSS) using Landsat-8 tasselled cap transformation (TCT). As a result, robust models were developed between measurements from satellite-derivedTand TSS and in situ measurements with coefficient of determination values of 0.854 and 0.812, respectively. These findings confirmed the possibility of using TCT to establish strong models for assessing surface water quality due to its capability of transforming a set of correlated data onto a convenient set of uncorrelated data, which maintain the major information associated with a physical phenomenon.

AB  - TROPOMI satellite data show substantial drops in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during COVID-19 physical distancing. To attribute NO2 changes to NOx emissions changes over short timescales, one must account for meteorology. We find that meteorological patterns were especially favorable for low NO2 in much of the United States in spring 2020, complicating comparisons with spring 2019. Meteorological variations between years can cause column NO2 differences of similar to 15% over monthly timescales. After accounting for solar angle and meteorological considerations, we calculate that NO2 drops ranged between 9.2% and 43.4% among 20 cities in North America, with a median of 21.6%. Of the studied cities, largest NO2 drops (>30%) were in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Toronto, and smallest drops (<12%) were in Miami, Minneapolis, and Dallas. These normalized NO2 changes can be used to highlight locations with greater activity changes and better understand the sources contributing to adverse air quality in each city.
