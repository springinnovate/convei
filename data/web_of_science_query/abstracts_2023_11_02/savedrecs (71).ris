TI  - Study on the utilization efficiency of land and water resources in the Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes and calculates the utilization and efficiency of land and water resources in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) from 2000 to 2014, using MODIS remote sensing data and the Water Use Efficiency Monitor in Central Asia (WUEMoCA) database. The results show that (1) Over the past 15 years, the water area in ASB has decreased at a rate of 1048 km(2) per year, from a proportion of 2.5% in 2000 to 1.5% in 2014. The Aral Sea in particular has witnessed a significant reduction of 60.28% of its area, dropping from 28,119 km(2) in 2000 to 11,169 km(2) in 2014. (2)The annual yield per unit area of wheat was the highest (4.16 tons/ha), followed by rice (2.27 tons/ha) and cotton (2.22 tons/ha). Water productivity of wheat in the ASB was the highest (0.881 kg/m(3)), followed by rice (0.689 kg/m(3)) and wheat (0.451 kg/m(3)). (3) Generally, crop and water productivity in irrigated areas along the Syr Darya River is greater than that of the Amu Darya River, and that of the upper irrigation areas is larger than the lower ones. The Fergana Valley and Tashkent areas have the relatively highest land and water resources utilization efficiency.

TI  - A large-scale multiobjective satellite data transmission scheduling algorithm based on SVM plus NSGA-II
T2  - SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite data transmission traffic appears a considerable growth tendency with the increase in the number of satellites and the client requirements, so how to solve the large-scale multiobjective satellite data transmission scheduling problem (SDTSP) within a valid period of time has become more and more important. In this context, a multiobjective satellite data transmission model is developed for the practical application, and a novel SVM + NSGA-II algorithm is proposed based on the periodicity of resource confliction in satellite data transmission, the large-scale characteristic of SDTSP and the multidimensional characteristic of the optimization objectives. Experimental results have demonstrated that SVM + NSGA-II can efficiently solve the large-scale multiobjective SDTSP in a very short period of time on the basis of ensuring the satisfactory optimization objectives by comparing with the other four state-of-the-art MOEAs.

TI  - Assimilating optical satellite remote sensing images and field data to predict surface indicators in the Western US: Assessing error in satellite predictions based on large geographical datasets with the use of machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indicators of vegetation composition, vegetation structure, bare ground cover, and gap size in drylands potentially gives information about the condition of ecosystems, in part because they are strongly related to factors such as erosion, wildlife habitat characteristics, and the suitability for some land uses. Field data collection based on points does not produce spatially continuous information about surface indicators and cannot cover vast geographic areas. Remote sensing is possibly a labor- and time-saving method to estimate important biophysical indicators of vegetation and surface condition at both temporal and spatial scales impossible with field methods. Regression models based on machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), can build relationships between field and remotely sensed data, while also providing error estimates. In this study, field data including over 15,000 points from the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands throughout the Western U.S., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance products with ancillary data were used as predictor variables in a k-fold cross-validation approach to RF modeling. RF regression models were built to predict fourteen indicators of vegetation cover and height, as well as bare gap parameters. The RF model estimates exhibited good correlations with independent samples, with a low bias and a low RMSE. External cross-validation showed good agreement with out-of-bag (OOB) errors produced by RF and also allowed mapping prediction uncertainty. Predicted distribution maps of the surface indicators were produced by using these relationships across the arid and semiarid Western U.S. The bias and RMSE distribution maps show that the sample insufficiency and unevenly pattern of sample strongly impact the accuracy of the RF regression and prediction. The results from this study clearly show the utility of RF as a means to estimate multiple dryland surface indicators from remotely sensed data, and the reliability of the OOB errors in assessing the accuracy of the predictions.

TI  - Estimating Forest Aboveground Carbon Storage in Hang-Jia-Hu Using Landsat TM/OLI Data and Random Forest Model
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic monitoring of carbon storage in forests resources is important for tracking ecosystem functionalities and climate change impacts. In this study, we used multi-year Landsat data combined with a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to estimate the forest aboveground carbon (AGC) in a forest area in China (Hang-Jia-Hu) and analyzed its spatiotemporal changes during the past two decades. Maximum likelihood classification was applied to make land-use maps. Remote sensing variables, such as the spectral band, vegetation indices, and derived texture features, were extracted from 20 Landsat TM and OLI images over five different years (2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, and 2018). These variables were subsequently selected according to their importance and subsequently used in the RF algorithm to build an estimation model of forest AGC. The results showed the following: (1) Verification of classification results showed maximum likelihood can extract land information effectively. Our land cover classification yielded overall accuracies between 86.86% and 89.47%. (2) Additionally, our RF models showed good performance in predicting forest AGC, with R-2 from 0.65 to 0.73 in the training and testing phase and a RMSE range between 3.18 and 6.66 Mg/ha. RMSEr in the testing phase ranged from 20.27 to 22.27 with a low model error. (3) The estimation results indicated that forest AGC in the past two decades increased with density at 10.14 Mg/ha, 21.63 Mg/ha, 26.39 Mg/ha, 29.25 Mg/ha, and 44.59 Mg/ha in 2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, and 2018. The total forest AGC storage had a growth rate of 285%. (4) Our study showed that, although forest area decreased in the study area during the time period under study, the total forest AGC increased due to an increment in forest AGC density. However, such an effect is overridden in the vicinity of cities by intense urbanization and the loss of forest covers. Our study demonstrated that the combined use of remote sensing data and machine learning techniques can improve our ability to track the forest changes in support of regional natural resource management practices.

TI  - Super-resolution enhancement of Sentinel-2 image for retrieving LAI and chlorophyll content of summer corn
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellite is a new generation of multi-spectral remote sensing technique with high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Especially, Sentinel-2 incorporates three red-edge bands with central wavelength at 705, 740 and 783 nm, which are very sensitive to vegetation changing, heath and variations. Unfortunately, their spatial resolution is only 20 m, which is lower comparably. This spatial resolution brings difficulties for mining the potential of Sentinel-2 image in vegetation monitoring. Therefore, we focus on enhancing the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 red edge band images to 10m using the SupReME algorithm. Furthermore, the summer corn canopy leaf area index (LAI), leaves chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) were retrieved by the linear and physical models for the corn growth monitoring purpose. The results showed that the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images had been enhanced to 10m from original 20m, and the estimation accuracy (EA) was over 97% for pixels planted by summer corn. Moreover, the accuracy of summer corn canopy LAI, LCC and CCC was improved respectively using enhanced Sentinel-2 images by SupReME method. During these three parameters retrieval, the red-edge bands or SWIR bands were introduced into optimal cost function and vegetation index which the accuracy of these models was high. The SupReME algorithm provides a valuable way for Sentinel-2 images enhancement, which is of great potential to mining Sentinel-2 images and multitude its application.

TI  - Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Network for High-Speed SAR Ship Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an active microwave imaging sensor for the high-resolution earth observation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been extensively applied in military, agriculture, geology, ecology, oceanography, etc., due to its prominent advantages of all-weather and all-time working capacity. Especially, in the marine field, SAR can provide numerous high-quality services for fishery management, traffic control, sea-ice monitoring, marine environmental protection, etc. Among them, ship detection in SAR images has attracted more and more attention on account of the urgent requirements of maritime rescue and military strategy formulation. Nowadays, most researches are focusing on improving the ship detection accuracy, while the detection speed is frequently neglected, regardless of traditional feature extraction methods or modern deep learning (DL) methods. However, the high-speed SAR ship detection is of great practical value, because it can provide real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military planning. Therefore, in order to address this problem, we proposed a novel high-speed SAR ship detection approach by mainly using depthwise separable convolution neural network (DS-CNN). In this approach, we integrated multi-scale detection mechanism, concatenation mechanism and anchor box mechanism to establish a brand-new light-weight network architecture for the high-speed SAR ship detection. We used DS-CNN, which consists of a depthwise convolution (D-Conv2D) and a pointwise convolution (P-Conv2D), to substitute for the conventional convolution neural network (C-CNN). In this way, the number of network parameters gets obviously decreased, and the ship detection speed gets dramatically improved. We experimented on an open SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) to validate the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method. To verify the strong migration capacity of our method, we also carried out actual ship detection on a wide-region large-size Sentinel-1 SAR image. Ultimately, under the same hardware platform with NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU, the experimental results indicated that the ship detection speed of our proposed method is faster than other methods, meanwhile the detection accuracy is only lightly sacrificed compared with the state-of-art object detectors. Our method has great application value in real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military planning.

TI  - Winter wheat identification by integrating spectral and temporal information derived from multi-resolution remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely crop acreage and distribution information are the basic data which drive many agriculture related applications. For identifying crop types based on remote sensing, methods using only a single image type have significant limitations. Current research that integrates fine and coarser spatial resolution images, using techniques such as unmixing methods, regression models, and others, usually results in coarse resolution abundance without sufficient detail within pixels, and limited attention has been paid to the spatial relationship between the pixels from these two kinds of images. Here we propose a new solution to identify winter wheat by integrating spectral and temporal information derived from multi-resolution remote sensing data and determine the spatial distribution of sub-pixels within the coarse resolution pixels. Firstly, the membership of pixels which belong to winter wheat is calculated using a 25-m resolution resampled Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image based on the Bayesian equation. Then, the winter wheat abundance (acreage fraction in a pixel) is assessed by using a multiple regression model based on the unique temporal change features from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data. Finally, winter wheat is identified by the proposed Abundance-Membership (AM) model based on the spatial relationship between the two types of pixels. Specifically, winter wheat is identified by comparing the spatially corresponding 10x10 membership pixels of each abundance pixel. In other words, this method takes advantage of the relative size of membership in a local space, rather than the absolute size in the entire study area. This method is tested in the major agricultural area of Yiluo Basin, China, and the results show that acreage accuracy (Aa) is 93.01% and sampling accuracy (As) is 91.40%. Confusion matrix shows that overall accuracy (OA) is 91.4% and the kappa coefficient (Kappa) is 0.755. These values are significantly improved compared to the traditional Maximum Likelihood classification (MLC) and Random Forest classification (RFC) which rely on spectral features. The results demonstrate that the identification accuracy can be improved by integrating spectral and temporal information. Since the identification of winter wheat is performed in the space corresponding to each MODIS pixel, the influence of differences of environmental conditions is greatly reduced. This advantage allows the proposed method to be effectively applied in other places.

TI  - Uncertainty Assessment in Multitemporal Land Use/Cover Mapping with Classification System Semantic Heterogeneity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover (LUC) data are commonly relied on to provide land surface information in a variety of applications. However, the exchange and joint use of LUC information from different datasets can be challenging due to semantic differences between common classification systems (CSs). In this paper, we propose an uncertainty assessment schema to capture the semantic translation uncertainty between heterogeneous LUC CSs and evaluate the data label uncertainty of multitemporal LUC mapping results caused by uncertainty propagation. The semantic translation uncertainty between CSs is investigated using a dynamic semantic reference system (DSRS) model and semantic similarity analysis. An object-based unsupervised change detection algorithm is adopted to determine the probability of changes in land patches, and novel uncertainty metrics are proposed to estimate the patch label uncertainty in LUC maps. The proposed uncertainty assessment schema was validated via experiments on four LUC datasets, and the results confirmed that semantic uncertainty had great impact on data reliability and that the uncertainty metrics could be used in the development of uncertainty controls in multitemporal LUC mapping by referring to uncertainty assessment results. We anticipate our findings will be used to improve the applicability and interoperability of LUC data products.

TI  - Analysis of characteristics of brightness temperature relative power spectrum before and after typhoon landfall in Guangdong coastal area
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - In the period of 2008-2017, there were 25 typhoons that made landfall in the coastal areas of Guangdong, China. However, abnormal thermal radiation around the typhoon landing area has not attracted much attention so far. In this paper, the infrared remote sensing temperature data of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite FY-2C/2E are used to analyze the thermal radiation anomalies associated with typhoon landfall. The temporal and spatial distributions of thermal radiation before and after typhoon landfall are quantified using bright temperature relative power spectrum (RPS). It is found that with the typhoon landfall, RPS was five times greater than the background value, experiencing a process of generating- increasing-reaching maximum-attenuating-extinction, which lasted longer than the typhoon process itself. There was a correlation between the area with enhanced RPS and typhoon landfall path, limited by terrestrial conditions and ocean heat supply. By analyzing the landfall path and RPS change trend during the typhoon landfall process, we show that the thermal radiation lasted for 10-20 days before and after typhoon landfall, and the thermal anomalies during this period were all related to the typhoon process. The mechanism of thermal radiation anomalies caused by typhoon landfall may be related to the heating leakage and water-vapor accumulation, that is, the ocean heat absorbed by typhoon is modulated by the air-sea interaction as the air rises, resulting in thermal radiation variation in different frequency bands and regions.

TI  - Quantification of driving factors on NDVI in oasis-desert ecotone using geographical detector method
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Within oasis-desert ecotone regions, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important parameter for evaluating the growth of vegetation. An accurate quantitative study between NDVI and environmental and anthropogenic factors is critical for understand the driving factors of vegetation growth in oasis-desert ecotone. In 2016, four periods Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS images, relevant climatological parameters data (air temperature, air relative humidity, wind velocity and accumulated temperature), land cover type data and soil data were selected as proxies. In order to quantify the explanatory power for NDVI spatial and temporal distribution in the southern edge of Dunhuang City and northern side of the Mingsha Mountain, the geographical detector model was used to explain the potential influences of factors versus the spatial distribution of NDVI, and each explanatory variable's relative importance can be calculated. The factor detector results disclose that the spatial distribution of NDVI is primarily dominated by land cover type. The risk detector results show that, high NDVI region is located within woodland. The mean value of NDVI displays an increase and then decrease trend with air temperature increase. With the increase of wind velocity and decrease of air relative humidity, the NDVI value shows a decrease trend. The interactive q values between the two factors are higher than any q value of separated factors. Results also indicate that the strongest interactive effects of NDVI are different in distinct seasons. Consequently, anthropogenic activity is more important than environmental factors on NDVI in oasis-desert ecotone. We also demonstrate that air relative humidity rather than air temperature have played a greater role in NDVI spatial distribution.

TI  - A Temporal Phase Coherence Estimation Algorithm and Its Application on DInSAR Pixel Selection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel selection is a crucial step of all advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques that have a direct impact on the quality of the final DInSAR products. In this paper, a full-resolution phase quality estimator, i.e., the temporal phase coherence (TPC), is proposed for DInSAR pixel selection. The method is able to work with both distributed scatterers (DSs) and permanent scatterers (PSs). The influence of different neighboring window sizes and types of interferograms combinations [both the single-master (SM) and the multi-master (MM)] on TPC has been studied. The relationship between TPC and phase standard deviation (STD) of the selected pixels has also been derived. Together with the classical coherence and amplitude dispersion methods, the TPC pixel selection algorithm has been tested on 37 VV polarization Radarsat-2 images of Barcelona Airport. Results show the feasibility and effectiveness of TPC pixel selection algorithm. Besides obvious improvements in the number of selected pixels, the new method shows some other advantages comparing with the other classical two. The proposed pixel selection algorithm, which presents an affordable computational cost, is easy to be implemented and incorporated into any advanced DInSAR processing chain for high-quality pixels identification.

TI  - Deep learning based winter wheat mapping using statistical data as ground references in Kansas and northern Texas, US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is a major staple crop and it is critical to monitor winter wheat production using efficient and automated means. This study proposed a novel approach to produce winter wheat maps using statistics as the training targets of supervised classification. Deep neural network architectures were built to link remotely sensed image series to the harvested areas of individual administrative units. After training, the resultant maps were generated using the activations on a middle layer of the deep model. The direct use of statistical data to some extent alleviates the shortage of ground samples in classification tasks and provides an opportunity to utilize a wealth of statistical records to improve land use mapping. The experiments were carried out in Kansas and Northern Texas during 2001-2017. For each study area the goal was to create winter maps that are consistent with USDA county-level statistics of harvested areas. The trained deep models automatically identified the seasonal pattern of winter wheat pixels without using pixel-level reference data. The winter wheat maps were compared with the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) for years when the CDL is available. In Kansas where the winter wheat extent of the CDL has high reported accuracy and agrees well with county statistics, the maps produced from the deep model was evaluated using the CDL as an independent test set. Northern Texas was selected as an example where the winter wheat area of the CDL is very different from official statistics, and the maps by the deep model enabled a map-to-map comparison with the CDL to highlight the areas of discrepancy. Visual representation of the deep model behaviors and recognized patterns show that deep learning is an automated and robust means to handle the variability of winter wheat seasonality without the need of manual feature engineering and intensive ground data collection. Showing the possibility of generating maps solely from regional statistics, the proposed deep learning approach has great potential to fill the historical gaps of conventional sample-based classification and extend applications to areas where only regional statistics are available. The flexible deep network architecture can be fused with various statistical datasets to fully employ existing sources of data and knowledge.

TI  - New Methods for Deriving Clear-Sky Surface Longwave Downward Radiation Based on Remotely Sensed Data and Ground Measurements
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of spatiotemporal characteristics of land surface energy budget is essential to understand the Earth's surface system. To some extent, the continuous development of remote sensing technology makes the estimation of global high-resolution surface energy budget possible. However, it is still challenging to accurately derive the global longwave downward radiation (LWDR) from space. In this study, two advanced methods were proposed to estimate clear-sky LWDR based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and corresponding ground measured LWDR from several global distributed radiation networks. One is a sensor-based Random Forest (RF) method that uses MODIS's surface elevation, sensor zenith angle, column precipitable water vapor (PWC), top of atmosphere radiance of band 28, 31, 34, and 36 as inputs; the other is a sensor-independent nonlinear regression method, which only uses the land surface temperature (LST) and PWC as inputs. The validation results show that the root mean square errors of RF and nonlinear regression method are less than 25.5 W/m(2) and bias are less than 0.5 W/m(2) under different tenfold cross-validation schemes. In addition, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the two models are very stable, and the retrieval errors are independent of changes of LST and PWC, and the accuracy does not rely on variations of land cover types, different observing angles, and different seasons. The comparison analysis indicates that the proposed methods are comparable or even better than existing algorithms. More importantly, the proposed sensor-independent regression method was designed for generality purpose so can easily be utilized with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of lake dynamics on the Mongolian Plateau using all available Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are important water resources on the Mongolian Plateau (MP) for human's livelihood and production as well as maintaining ecosystem services. Previous studies, based on the Landsat-based analyses at epoch scale and visual interpretation approach, have reported a significant loss in the lake areas and numbers, especially from the late 1990s to 2010. Given the remarkable inter- and infra-annual variations of lakes in the aril and semi-arid region, a comprehensive picture of annual lake dynamics is needed. Here we took advantages of the power of all the available Landsat images and the cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map water body for each scene, and then extracted lakes by post-processing including raster-to-vector conversion and separation of lakes and rivers. Continuous dynamics of the lakes over 1 km2 was monitored annually on the MP from 1991 to 2017. We found a significant shrinkage in the lake areas and numbers of the MP from 1991 to 2009, then the decreasing lakes on the MP have recovered since circa 2009. Specifically, Inner Mongolia of China experienced more dramatic lake variations than Mongolia. A few administrative regions with huge lakes, including Hulunbuir and Xilin Gol in Inner Mongolia and Ubsa in Mongolia, dominated the lake area variations in the study area, suggesting that the prior treatments on these major lakes would be critical for water management on the MP. The varied drivers of lake variations in different regions showed the complexity of factors impacting lakes. While both natural and anthropogenic factors significantly affected lake dynamics before 2009, precipitation played increasingly important rule for the recovery of lakes on the MP after 2009.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Doppler Centroid and Channel Errors Estimation in Azimuth Multi-Channel SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in azimuth can overcome the minimum-antenna-area constraint of the conventional SAR in high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) imaging. However, the SAR system suffers from amplitude and phase mismatch among channels and nonideal antenna pattern, which will result in azimuth ambiguity and ghost targets in the final image. Therefore, taking the nonbandlimited signal and channel errors into account, a practical azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio (AASR) model of multi-channel SAR system is established. Meanwhile, the baseband Doppler centroid (DC) frequency related to channel errors also has an influence on image quality. Then, an effective method is proposed to calculate the baseband DC frequency according to the jumping points of the channel phase errors estimate. Subsequently, considering the effect of azimuth antenna pattern (AAP), a corresponding relationship between the ideal steering vectors and the signal subspace from the decomposing covariance matrix is established. After that, based on the uniqueness of the signal subspace and the correct corresponding relationship, an accurate method is proposed to estimate the channel phase errors by minimizing the minimum mean square error (MMSE) of the signal subspace. Finally, an accurate multi-channel SAR imaging diagram is shown to effectively mitigate the azimuth ambiguous energy caused by channel errors. Simulation and real data experiments, including four channel airborne SAR data with a bandwidth of 210 MHz and the Chinese Gaofen-3 dual receiving channel (DRC) spaceborne SAR data, validate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Extreme Climate Events on Vegetation Activity in the North South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme climate events frequently exert serious effects on terrestrial vegetation activity. However, these effects are still uncertain in widely distributed areas with different climate zones. Transect analysis is important to understand how terrestrial vegetation responds to climate change, especially extreme climate events, by substituting space for time. In this paper, seven extreme climate indices and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are employed to examine changes in the extreme climate events and vegetation activity. To reduce the uncertainty of the NDVI, two satellite-derived NDVI datasets, including the third generation Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS-3g) NDVI dataset and the NDVI from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites on Star Web Servers (SWS), were employed to capture changes in vegetation activity. The impacts of climate extremes on vegetation activity were then assessed over the period of 1982-2012 using the North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC) as a case. The results show that vegetation activity was overall strengthened from 1982 to 2012 in the NSTEC. In addition, extreme high temperature events revealed an increased trend of approximately 5.15 days per decade, while a weakened trend (not significant) was found in extreme cold temperature events. The strengthened vegetation activities could be associated with enhanced extreme high temperature events and weakened extreme cold temperature events over the past decades in most of the NSTEC. Despite this, inversed changes were also found locally between vegetation activity and extreme climate events (e.g., in the Northeast Plain). These phenomena could be associated with differences in vegetation type, human activity, as well as the combined effects of the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. This study highlights the importance of accounting for the vital roles of extreme climate effects on vegetation activity.

TI  - InSAR Time Series Analysis of L-Band Data for Understanding Tropical Peatland Degradation and Restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, satellite radar observations are employed to reveal spatiotemporal changes in ground surface height of peatlands that have, and have not, undergone restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our time series analysis of 26 scenes of Advanced Land Observation Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) Phased-Array L-band Synthetic-Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images acquired between 2006 and 2010 suggests that peatland restoration was positively affected by the construction time of dams-the earlier the dam was constructed, the more significant the restoration appears. The results also suggest that the dams resulted in an increase of ground water level, which in turn stopped peat losing height. For peatland areas without restoration, the peatland continuously lost peat height by up to 7.7 cm/yr. InSAR-derived peat height changes allow the investigation of restoration effects over a wide area and can also be used to indirectly assess the relative magnitude and spatial pattern of peatland damage caused by drainage and fires. Such an assessment can provide key information for guiding future restoration activities.

TI  - Effects of Land-Use Practices on Woody Plant Cover Dynamics in Sahelian Agrosystems in Burkina Faso since the 1970s-1980s Droughts
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1970s-1980s droughts in the Sahel caused a significant degradation of land and plant cover. To cope with this situation, populations have developed several biophysical and social adaptation practices. Many of these are agroforestry practices and contribute to the maintenance of agrosystems. Unfortunately, they remain insufficiently documented and their contributions to the resilience of agrosystems insufficiently evaluated. Many authors widely link the regreening in the Sahel after droughts to the resumption of rainfall. This study examines the contribution of agroforestry practices to the improvement of woody plant cover in the North of Burkina Faso after the 1970s-1980s droughts. The examination of practices is carried out by integrating the rainfall, soil, and geomorphology variables. Landsat images are used to detect changes in woody plant cover: increasing, decreasing, and no-change in the Enhanced Vegetation Index. In addition, 230 field observations, coupled with interviews conducted on the different categories of change, have allowed to characterize the biophysical environment and identify land-use practices. The results show a variability of vegetation index explained to 9% (R-2 = 0.09) by rainfall. However, Chi-Squared independence tests show a strong dependence between changes in woody plant cover and geomorphology (p = 0.0018 *), land use, land cover (p = 0.0001 *), and land-use practices (p = 0.0001 *). Our results show that rainfall alone is not enough to explain the dynamics of agrosystems' woody plant cover. Agricultural and social practices related to the dynamics of farmer perceptions play a key role.

AB  - ReSUMe La validation au sol de la phenologie de la vegetation estimee par satellite est difficile parce que les donnees phenologiques in situ sont mal distribuees et surtout observees a partir d'un nombre limite d'especes vegetales a des phenophases discretes. Le reseau PhenoCam recemment developpe mesure en continue la croissance du verdissement de la vegetation. Il peut etre utilise pour valider la phenologie de la vegetation estimee par satellite a travers une variete de types fonctionnels de plantes. Dans cette etude, nous avons utilise les coordonnees chromatiques vertes (GCC) en Amerique du Nord de PhenoCam pour evaluer la phenologie des prairies derivee de trois types d'indice de vegetation MODIS: l'indice de vegetation de difference normalisee (NDVI), l'indice de vegetation ameliore (IVI) et l'indice GCC par pixel (GCCpp) qui a ete calcule pour decrire la couleur moyenne de la vegetation au niveau des pixels. Le debut du verdissement (SOG), la fin du verdissement (EOG) et la longueur de la periode vegetative (LOG) et les dates de la dynamique saisonniere detaillees pour chaque annee ont ete comparees. Nos resultats indiquent que l'indice MODIS IVI peut etre utilise pour predire les mesures phenologiques et la dynamique saisonniere des prairies a partir de PhenoCam GCC. Plus important encore, nous avons quantifie la difference entre les indices SOG, EOG, et LOG et la saisonnalite estimee a partir de donnees satellites et observees pres de la surface Nous avons decouvert que GCCpp peut etre plus approprie que NDVI et EVI pour estimer la dynamique de verdissement des prairies au cours de la senescence.Ground validation of satellite-based vegetation phenology has been challenging because ground phenology data are sparsely distributed and mostly observed from limited numbers of plant species at discrete phenophases. The recently developed PhenoCam network has measured continuous growth of vegetation canopy greenness that can be used to validate satellite-based vegetation phenology across a variety of plant functional types. In this study, we used PhenoCam green chromatic coordinate (GCC) in North America to evaluate grassland phenology derived from three types of MODIS vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and a per-pixel GCC (GCCpp) which was computed to describe the average vegetation color at the pixel level. The start of greenness (SOG), end of greenness (EOG), and length of greenness (LOG), and the dates for detailed seasonal dynamics for each site-year were compared. Our results indicate that MODIS VIs can be used to predict phenological metrics and seasonal dynamics in grassland greenness measured from PhenoCam GCC. More importantly, we quantified the difference between SOG, EOG, and LOG and seasonality estimated from satellite and near-surface remote sensing and discovered that GCCpp may be more suitable than NDVI and EVI at estimating dynamics in grassland greenness during senescence.

TI  - A spatio-temporal continuous soil moisture dataset over the Tibet Plateau from 2002 to 2015
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Surface soil moisture is a key variable in the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere, and critical to meteorology, hydrology, and ecology. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as "The third pole of the world" and "Asia's water towers", exerts huge influences on and sensitive to global climates. In this situation, longer time series of soil moisture can provide sufficient information to understand the role of the TP. This paper presents the first comprehensive dataset (2002-2015) of spatio-temporal continuous soil moisture at 0.25 degrees resolution, based on satellite-based optical (i.e. MODIS) and microwave (ECV) products using a machine learning method named general regression neural network (GRNN). The dataset itself reveals significant information on the soil moisture and its changes over the TP, and can aid to understand the potential driven mechanisms for climate change over the TP.

TI  - Widespread global increase in intense lake phytoplankton blooms since the 1980s
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater blooms of phytoplankton affect public health and ecosystem services globally(1,2). Harmful effects of such blooms occur when the intensity of a bloom is too high, or when toxin-producing phytoplankton species are present. Freshwater blooms result in economic losses of more than US$4 billion annually in the United States alone, primarily from harm to aquatic food production, recreation and tourism, and drinkingwater supplies(3). Studies that document bloom conditions in lakes have either focused only on individual or regional subsets of lakes(4-6), or have been limited by a lack of longterm observations(7-9). Here we use three decades of high-resolution Landsat 5 satellite imagery to investigate long-term trends in intense summertime near-surface phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes globally. We find that peak summertime bloom intensity has increased in most (68 per cent) of the lakes studied, revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions. Lakes that have experienced a significant (P < 0.1) decrease in bloom intensity are rare (8 per cent). The reason behind the increase in phytoplankton bloom intensity remains unclear, however, as temporal trends do not track consistently with temperature, precipitation, fertilizer-use trends or other previously hypothesized drivers. We do find, however, that lakes with a decrease in bloom intensity warmed less compared to other lakes, suggesting that lake warming may already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication(10,11). Our findings support calls for water quality management efforts to better account for the interactions between climate change and local hydrological conditions(12,13).

TI  - On the cross-shelf exchange driven by frontal eddies along a western boundary current during austral winter 2007
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Western boundary currents are characterised by high mesoscale eddy activity including that of cyclonic frontal eddies (CFEs). These form frequently adjacent to the shelf-break, export coastal water and affect biological productivity. Here, we study the physical properties of eddies identified within the intensification zone of the East Australian Current (EAC) through the analysis of remotely sensed data, the application of an ocean circulation model and the evaluation of Lagrangian simulations during austral winter 2007. We examine the spatial and temporal evolution of identified eddies, investigate their formation mechanism, and quantify the contribution made to cross-shelf exchanges. The mesoscale eddies are tracked from generation to decay using an eddy detection and tracking method. In this case study, we identify two CFEs referred to as C-1 and C-2 with lifetimes of 11 and 38 days and radii of 45 and 70 km, respectively, and one anticyclonic eddy (ACE) with a lifetime of 62 days and a radius of 60 km. Both CFEs interact with the ACE leading to quasi-stationary dipoleeddies located in the vicinity of the shelf. This is the first time dipole-eddies are reported for the intensification zone of the EAC. The location of CFEs characterised by negative sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and clockwise rotation coincides with remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) anomalies. CFEs C-1 and C-2 appear to contribute in different ways to the cross-shelf transport along the shelfbreak. CFE C-1 drives a stronger onshore transport, while CFE C-2 appears to enhance the offshore transport. The estimated export of shelf water associated with CFE C-2 is estimated with about 1.23 Sv (similar to 106 km(3) day(-1)). It renews the regional shelf water in about 7 days. The lifetime of CFE C-2 is about 38 days, thus the eddy had the potential to flush the shelf at least five times. The CFEs intensify the cross-shelf exchange that is due to the winddriven cyclonic circulation of the Fraser Gyre. This seasonally occurring gyre dominates the local shelf during austral autumn and winter. The results from this study demonstrate the importance of CFEs in exporting cooler and Chl-a enriched shelf water into the warmer and oligotrophic waters of the southward-flowing EAC.

TI  - Frequency and cost of live vaccines administered too soon after prior live vaccine in children aged 12 months through 6 years, 2014-2017
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To identify number of children who received live vaccines outside recommended intervals between doses and calculate corrective revaccination costs.Methods: We analyzed >1.6 million vaccination records for children aged 12 months through 6 years from six immunization information system (IIS) Sentinel Sites from 2014-15 when live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, FluMist (R) Quadrivalent) was recommended for use, and from 2016-17, when not recommended for use. Depending on the vaccine, insufficient intervals between live vaccine doses are less than 24 or 28 days from a preceding live vaccine dose. Private and public purchase costs of vaccines were used to determine revaccination costs of live vaccine doses administered during the live vaccine conflict interval. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, combined MMRV, and LAIV were live vaccines evaluated in this study.Results: Among 946,659 children who received at least one live vaccine dose from 2014-15, 4,873 (0.5%) received at least one dose too soon after a prior live vaccine (revaccination cost, $786,413) with a median conflict interval of 16 days. Among 704,591 children who received at least one live vaccine dose from 2016-17, 1,001 (0.1%) received at least one dose too soon after a prior live vaccine (revaccination cost, $181,565) with a median conflict interval of 14 days. The live vaccine most frequently administered out-side of the recommended intervals was LAIV from 2014-15, and varicella from 2016-17.Conclusions: Live vaccine interval errors were rare (0.5%), indicating an adherence to recommendations. If all invalid doses were corrected by revaccination over the two time periods, the cost within the IIS Sentinel Sites would be nearly one million dollars. Provider awareness about live vaccine conflicts, especially with LAIV, could prevent errors, and utilization of clinical decision support functionality within IISs and Electronic Health Record Systems can facilitate better vaccination practices.

TI  - Characteristics and influence of green tide drift and dissipation in Shandong Rongcheng coastal water based on remote sensing
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Green tides in the Yellow Sea have occurred in large-scale blooms since 2007. Originating in the southern Yellow Sea and drifting northward continuously, these green tides have severely affected the coastal ecological environment. To analyze the influence of green tides on marine aquaculture in the Rongcheng coastal water (the northernmost sea area influenced by green tide), we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite imagery and the sea surface wind (SSW) data. We also used field investigation to analyze the drift trajectory, drift speed, dissipation speed and distribution density of green tides. The results show that the main body of a green tide will drift northeast and continue in this direction after crossing the Rongcheng Chengshanjiao coastal water. Between 2013 and 2018, the drift speeds of green tides to the north of this area were within 1-5 km/d, the drift speed in the east-west direction was 0.3-4 km/d, and the interannual difference was not significant. The dissipation speed of the green tide in the Rongcheng Sea is generally within the range of 1-5 km(2)/d and shows little interannual difference. The distribution density in the southern area of Rongcheng is the highest, ranging from 3% to 7%. The area with the highest frequency of influence is also the area with the greatest distribution density of green tides, and disasters are most severe here. A reasonable collection area is proposed, based on the above analysis. This research provides the basis for understanding the characteristics of green tides in the dissipation phase, and the prevention and control methods of green tide disasters in the Rongcheng coastal water.

TI  - High temporal resolution of leaf area data improves empirical estimation of grain yield
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical yield estimation from satellite data has long lacked suitable combinations of spatial and temporal resolutions. Consequently, the selection of metrics, i.e., temporal descriptors that predict grain yield, has likely been driven by practicality and data availability rather than by systematic targetting of critically sensitive periods as suggested by knowledge of crop physiology. The current trend towards hyper-temporal data raises two questions: How does temporality affect the accuracy of empirical models? Which metrics achieve optimal performance? We followed an in silico approach based on crop modelling which can generate any observation frequency, explore a range of growing conditions and reduce the cost of measuring yields in situ. We simulated wheat crops across Australia and regressed six types of metrics derived from the resulting time series of Leaf Area Index (LAI) against wheat yields. Empirical models using advanced LAI metrics achieved national relevance and, contrary to simple metrics, did not benefit from the addition of weather information. This suggests that they already integrate most climatic effects on yield. Simple metrics remained the best choice when LAI data are sparse. As we progress into a data-rich era, our results support a shift towards metrics that truly harness the temporal dimension of LAI data.

TI  - Innovative Zeolite Nanocrystals Bulk-Modified Screen Printed Electrochemical Sensor for Simultaneous Determination of Methocarbamol and Paracetamol
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple and low cost home-made zeolite bulk-modified screen printed electrochemical sensors (ZY/SDS/MSPE) have been constructed for simultaneous determination of methocarbamol (MTH) and paracetamol (PAR) in pharmaceutical dosage form and biological fluids. The enhanced electrochemical performance of ZY/SDS/MSPE compared to unmodified electrodes is most probably due to the synergistic effect of zeolite crystals. The sensor has been utilized as a disposable sensor for quantification of MTH and PAR near the physiological pH by square wave voltammetry. Under optimal experimental conditions, calibration curves showed excellent linearity over the concentration range from 4.00 x 10(-7) -1.00 x 10(-4) M for both compounds with detection limits of 8.6 x 10(-8) and 8.0 x 10(-8) M for MTH and PAR, respectively. The proposed ZY/SDS/MSPE has been applied successfully for simultaneous determination of MTH and PAR in presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). Furthermore, excellent peak potential separation between MTH and diclofenac (DIF), which is present as co-formulated in other pharmaceutical formulations, has been achieved. The electrode exhibited satisfactory accuracy (100 +/- 2%) and precision (RSD <= 2%) for MTH and PAR. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

TI  - Land surface temperature variations and their relationship to fractional vegetation coverage in subtropical regions: A case study in Fujian Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data of MODIS 11A2 and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products of MODIS 13Q1 were used to analyse the spatial and temporal changes of LST and its relationship with vegetation from 2001 to 2015 in the subtropical region of Fujian Province, China. The LST and NDVI products were reconstructed by Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering for abnormal values or missing data due to the influence of cloud contamination. The LST of Fujian decreases from its southeast coast to its northwest mountain area, and the annual average highest LST is greater than 30 degrees C while the lowest LST is about 15 degrees C. In the past 15 years, the average LST in Fujian has declined gradually due to an increase in fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), but the highest LST increased from 30.95 degrees C to 33.05 degrees C across south-east coastal zone cities due to rapid urbanization. From 2001 to 2015, the LST of Fujian Province trended slightly downward; the LST area, however, significantly decreased by 18.85% of the total area of the province and was twice that of the (significant) increase in LST. The changing trend distributions of LST are opposite to those of FVC in general, but LST decreases to greater extent as FVC increases when FVC is above 0.2 - every 10% increase in FVC is accompanied by about a 1.1 degrees C decrease in LST.

TI  - Improved Characterisation of Vegetation and Land Surface Seasonal Dynamics in Central Japan with Himawari-8 Hypertemporal Data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral vegetation index time series data, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), from moderate resolution, polar-orbiting satellite sensors have widely been used for analysis of vegetation seasonal dynamics from regional to global scales. The utility of these datasets is often limited as frequent/persistent cloud occurrences reduce their effective temporal resolution. In this study, we evaluated improvements in capturing vegetation seasonal changes with 10-min resolution NDVI data derived from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), one of new-generation geostationary satellite sensors. Our analysis was focused on continuous monitoring sites, representing three major ecosystems in Central Japan, where in situ time-lapse digital images documenting sky and surface vegetation conditions were available. The very large number of observations available with AHI resulted in improved NDVI temporal signatures that were remarkably similar to those acquired with in situ spectrometers and captured seasonal changes in vegetation and snow cover conditions in finer detail with more certainty than those obtained from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), one of the latest polar-orbiting satellite sensors. With the ability to capture in situ-quality NDVI temporal signatures, AHI "hypertemporal" data have the potential to improve spring and autumn phenology characterisation as well as the classification of vegetation formations.

TI  - Current management of patients with melanoma who are found to be sentinel node-positive
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The results of the DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II studies, published in 2016 and mid-2017, indicated no survival benefit from completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in melanoma patients with positive sentinel nodes (SNs). Subsequently, several studies have been published reporting a benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with stage III melanoma. The current study assessed how these findings influenced management of SN-positive patients in a dedicated melanoma treatment centre. Methods SN-positive patients treated at Melanoma Institute Australia between July 2017 and December 2018 were prospectively identified. Surgeons completed a questionnaire documenting the management of each patient. Information on patients, primary tumours, SNs, further treatment and follow-up was collected from patient files, the institutional research database and pathology reports. Results During the 18-month study period, 483 patients underwent SN biopsy. A positive SN was found in 61 (13%). Two patients (3%) requested CLND because of anxiety about observation in view of unfavourable primary tumour and SN characteristics. The other 59 patients (97%) were followed with a four-monthly ultrasound examination of the relevant lymph node field(s). Two of them (3%) developed an isolated nodal recurrence after 4 and 11 months of follow-up. Fifty-seven patients (93%) were seen following the publication of the first two adjuvant systemic therapy studies in November 2017; 46 (81%) were referred to a medical oncologist to discuss adjuvant systemic therapy, which 32 (70%) chose to receive. Conclusion At Melanoma Institute Australia most patients with an involved SN are now managed without CLND. The majority are referred to a medical oncologist and receive adjuvant systemic therapy.

TI  - Transcriptional effects in the estuarine guppy <i>Poecilia vivipara</i> exposed to sanitary sewage in laboratory and i<i>n situ</i>
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban growth has increased sanitary sewage discharges in coastal ecosystems, negatively affecting the aquatic biota. Mangroves, one of the most human-affected coastal biomes, are areas for reproduction and nursing of several species. In order to evaluate the effects of sanitary sewage effluents in mangrove species, this study assessed the hepatic transcriptional responses of guppy fish Poecilia vivipara exposed to sanitary sewage 33% (v:v), using suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH), high throughput sequencing of RNA (Ion-proton) and quantification of transcript levels by qPCR of some identified genes in fish kept in a sewage-contaminated environment. Genes identified are related predominantly to xenobiotic biotransformation, immune system and sexual differentiation. The qPCR results confirmed the induction of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), glutathione S transferase A-like (GST A-like) methyltransferase (MET) and UDP glycosyltransferase 1A (UDPGT1A), and repression of complement component C3 (C3), doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1), and transferrin (TF) in the laboratory experiment. In the field exposure, the transcript levels of CYP1A, DMRT1, MET, GST A-like and UDPGT1A were higher in fishes exposed at the contaminated sites compared to the reference site. Chemical analysis in fish from the laboratory and in situ experiments, and surface sediment from the sewage-contaminated sites revealed relevant levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs). These data reinforce the use of P. vivipara as a sentinel for monitoring environmental contamination in coastal regions.

TI  - More than Nothing: Examining the Worldview Influences of Nonreligious College Students
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonreligious individuals are often defined by their absence of a religious worldview rather than the worldview that might take its place. This study examines data from a unique survey that asked a representative sample of first-year college students to identify important influences on their worldview at the beginning and end of the year. Cross-sectional analyses show that nonreligious students are less likely than religious students to identify family background or cultural traditions as important worldview influences, but are more likely to say that sexual orientation is an important influence on their worldview. Longitudinal analyses show that individuals who were nonreligious at a previous time are less likely to identify family as an important influence at a later time regardless of whether they are still nonreligious. Individuals who become nonreligious over time shift their perceived worldview influences away from religious beliefs and cultural traditions to philosophical traditions. These findings help contribute to our understanding of the content and dynamics of secular worldviews.

TI  - Post-disturbance recovery of forest cover and tree height differ with management in Central Europe
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Recovery from disturbances is a prominent measure of forest ecosystem resilience, with swift recovery indicating resilient systems. The forest ecosystems of Central Europe have recently been affected by unprecedented levels of natural disturbance, yet our understanding of their ability to recover from disturbances is still limited. Objectives We here integrated satellite and airborne Lidar data to (i) quantify multi-decadal post-disturbance recovery of two indicators of forest structure, and (ii) compare the recovery trajectories of forest structure among managed and un-managed forests. Methods We developed satellite-based models predicting Lidar-derived estimates of tree cover and stand height at 30 m grain across a 3100 km(2) landscape in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem (Central Europe). We summarized the percentage of disturbed area that recovered to > 40% tree cover and > 5 m stand height and quantified the variability in both indicators over a 30-year period. The analyses were stratified by three management regimes (managed, protected, strictly protected) and two forest types (beech-dominated, spruce-dominated). Results We found that on average 84% of the disturbed area met our recovery threshold 30 years post-disturbance. The rate of recovery was slower in un-managed compared to managed forests. Variability in tree cover was more persistent over time in un-managed forests, while managed forests strongly converged after a few decades post-disturbance. Conclusion We conclude that current management facilitates the recovery of forest structure in Central European forest ecosystems. However, our results underline that forests recovered well from disturbances also in the absence of human intervention. Our analysis highlights the high resilience of Central European forest ecosystems to recent disturbances.

TI  - Remote sensing of cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters: present knowledge and future challenges
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Timely monitoring, detection and quantification of cyanobacterial blooms are especially important for controlling public health risks and understanding aquatic ecosystem dynamics. Due to the advantages of simultaneous data acquisition over large geographical areas and high temporal coverage, remote sensing strongly facilitates cyanobacterial bloom monitoring in inland waters. We provide a comprehensive review regarding cyanobacterial bloom remote sensing in inland waters including cyanobacterial optical characteristics, operational remote sensing algorithms of chlorophyll, phycocyanin and cyanobacterial bloom areas, and satellite imaging applications. We conclude that there have many significant progresses in the remote sensing algorithm of cyanobacterial pigments over the past 30 years. The band ratio algorithms in the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions have great potential for the remote estimation of chlorophyll a in eutrophic and hypereutrophic inland waters, and the floating algae index (FAI) is the most widely used spectral index for detecting dense cyanobacterial blooms. Landsat, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) are the most widely used products for monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria in inland waters due to the appropriate temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. Future work should primarily focus on the development of universal algorithms, remote retrievals of cyanobacterial blooms in olig-otrophic waters, and the algorithm applicability to mapping phycocyanin at a large spatial-temporal scale. The applications of satellite images will greatly improve our understanding of the driving mechanism of cyanobacterial blooms by combining numerical and ecosystem dynamics models.

TI  - Utility of the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay in sentinel node mapping for early gastric cancer patients
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To safely perform minimized gastrectomy based on sentinel node (SN) concept for early gastric cancer patients, intraoperative diagnostic accuracy is indispensable. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay in the intraoperative diagnosis of SN metastasis in early gastric cancer patients compared with that of histopathological examination. Methods We conducted a prospective study using the OSNA assay for 43 patients with cT1N0M0 gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy with SN mapping. All the SNs and selected non-SNs were examined by routine histopathological diagnosis, and the OSNA assay. Results We performed permanent histopathology (PH) in 1732 lymph nodes (LNs) (286 SNs and 1446 non-SNs) obtained from 43 patients. We also evaluated 439 LNs (286 SNs and 153 non-SNs) with the OSNA assay in addition to PH. Intraoperative histopathology (IH) was performed in 214 LNs (213 SNs and 1 non-SN). PH revealed LN metastasis in 6 patients (14%), all of whom showed positive SNs by PH. The diagnostic accuracy to predict the LN status based on the SN concept by histological examination was 100%. The concordance rate between the OSNA assay and the PH and IH were 0.970 and 0.981 respectively. Discordant results between PH and OSNA assay were observed in 13 LNs. The sensitivity and specificity of the OSNA assay compared with those of PH were 0.636, and 0.988, and compared with those of IH were 0.800, and 0.995. Conclusion Our results suggest that the OSNA assay is a useful and convenient tool for the intraoperative detection of SN metastasis in early gastric cancer patients.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a standard staging procedure for early axillary lymph node-negative breast cancer. As an alternative to the currently used radioactive tracers for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection during the surgical procedure, a number of studies have shown promising results using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Here, we developed a new handheld, cordless, and lightweight magnetic probe for SPIO detection. Methods Resovist (SPIO nanoparticles) were detected by the newly developed handheld probe, and the SLN detection rate was compared to that of the standard radioisotope (RI) method using radioactive colloids (Tc-99m) and a blue dye (indigo carmine). This was a multicenter prospective clinical trial that included 220 patients with breast cancer scheduled for sentinel node biopsy after a clinical diagnosis of negative axillary lymph node from three facilities in Japan. Results Of the 210 patients analyzed, SLN was detected in 94.8% (199/210 cases, 90% confidence interval [CI]) with our magnetic method and in 98.1% (206/210 cases, 90% CI) with the RI method. The magnetic method exceeded the threshold identification rate of 90%. Conclusion This was the first clinical study to use a novel handheld magnetometer to detect SLN, which we demonstrate to be not inferior to the RI method.

TI  - The 'wonderful' donkey - Of real and fabled donkeys
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - An ethological appreciation of the donkey has confirmed that it is a special and unique animal. The donkey is a well-adapted, sensitive, sociable, intelligent and notably loyal animal. Their so-called 'stubbornness' (dumbness) points rather to a species-specific intelligence to survive. Because of their domestication, they have been incorporated into the human world, mostly as pack, draught and riding animals. In the Ancient Near East (ANE) they sometimes also acted as 'divine agents', for example, in Balaam's fable (Numbers 22). An ecological hermeneutic focus on this fable has evoked sympathy for the donkey. Even if there is over-ascription because of the ANE mytho-poetical worldview, an authentic donkey can still be discovered behind this 'speaking' animal. Perhaps we need far more animal-centric fables instead of anthropocentric fables nowadays to appreciate the donkey as a remarkable animal.

TI  - Land surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images based on back-propagation neural network
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter related to the environmental assessment concerning the surface energy, water balance, greenhouse effect, etc. at local and global scales. With the rapid development of the remote sensing technology, various methodologies have been developed to retrieve LST from space-based remote sensing images. Due to the ill-posed problem, the LST retrieval is still a challenge. In this research, a so-called multiple band reflectance (MBR)-LST model has been proposed based on the back-propagation neural (BPN) network, which can be employed to retrieve the LSTs from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/TIRS images as well as produce continuous spatial LST distributions with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Experiments conducted in two randomly selected areas in mainland China proved that the proposed MBR-LST model has yielded a much better performance than the traditional radiative transfer equation (RTE) method with respect to both the accuracy and stability for the LST retrievals. Moreover, another significant advantage of the proposed MBR-LST is the generic nature - once trained by the sample data in the whole region of mainland China, the proposed MBR-LST model can be utilized for the accurate LST-retrievals in any area of mainland China.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of child maltreatment cases presenting to Canadian emergency departments
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is a sentinel surveillance program that collects and analyzes data on injuries and poisonings of people presenting to emergency departments (EDs) at 11 pediatric and eight general hospitals (currently) across Canada. To date, CHIRPP is an understudied source of child maltreatment (CM) surveillance data. This study: (1) describes CM cases identified in the CHIRPP database between1997/98 to 2010/11; (2) assesses the level of CM case capture over the 14-year period and; (3) uses content analysis to identify additional information captured in text fields.Methods: We reviewed cases of children under 16 whose injuries were reported as resulting from CM from 1997/98 to 2010/11. A time trend analysis of cases to assess capture was conducted and content analysis was applied to develop a codebook to assess information from text fields in CHIRPP. The frequency of types of CM and other variables identified from text fields were calculated. Finally, the frequency of types of CM were presented by age and gender.Results: A total of 2200 CM cases were identified. There was a significant decrease in the capture of CM cases between 1999 and 2005. Physical abuse was the most prevalent type (57%), followed by sexual assault (31%), unspecified maltreatment (7%), injury as the result of exposure to family violence (3%) and neglect (2%). Text fields provided additional information including perpetrator characteristics, the use of drugs and/or alcohol during the injury event, information regarding the involvement of non-health care professionals, whether maltreatment occurred during a visitation period with a parent and, whether the child was removed from their home.Conclusions: The findings from this initial study indicate that CHIRPP could be a complimentary source of CM data. As an injury surveillance system, physical abuse and sexual assault were better captured than other types of CM. Text field data provided unique information on a number of additional details surrounding the injury event, including risk factors.

AB  - Photosynthesis of the Amazon rainforest plays an important role in the regional and global carbon cycles, but, despite considerable in situ and space-based observations, it has been intensely debated whether there is a dry-season increase in greenness and photosynthesis of the moist tropical Amazonian forests. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is emitted by chlorophyll, has a strong positive linear relationship with photosynthesis at the canopy scale. Recent advancements have allowed us to observe SIF globally with Earth observation satellites. Here we show that forest SIF did not decrease in the early dry season and increased substantially in the late dry season and early part of wet season, using SIF data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which has unprecedented spatial resolution and near-daily global coverage. Using in situ CO2 eddy flux data, we also show that cloud cover rarely affects photosynthesis at TROPOMI's midday overpass, a time when the forest canopy is most often light-saturated. The observed dry-season increases of forest SIF are not strongly affected by sun-sensor geometry, which was attributed as creating a pseudo dry-season green-up in the surface reflectance data. Our results provide strong evidence that greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of the tropical Amazonian forest increase during the dry season.

TI  - An inverse latitudinal gradient in infection probability and phylogenetic diversity for <i>Leucocytozoon</i> blood parasites in New World birds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic variation in environmental conditions as well as host traits that promote parasite transmission may impact infection rates and community assembly of vector-transmitted parasites. Identifying the ecological, environmental and historical determinants of parasite distributions and diversity is therefore necessary to understand disease outbreaks under changing environments. Here, we identified the predictors and contributions of infection probability and phylogenetic diversity of Leucocytozoon (an avian blood parasite) at site and species levels across the New World. To explore spatial patterns in infection probability and lineage diversity for Leucocytozoon parasites, we surveyed 69 bird communities from Alaska to Patagonia. Using phylogenetic Bayesian hierarchical models and high-resolution satellite remote-sensing data, we determined the relative influence of climate, landscape, geography and host phylogeny on regional parasite community assembly. Infection rates and parasite diversity exhibited considerable variation across regions in the Americas. In opposition to the latitudinal gradient hypothesis, both the diversity and prevalence of Leucocytozoon parasites decreased towards the equator. Host relatedness and traits known to promote vector exposure neither predicted infection probability nor parasite diversity. Instead, the probability of a bird being infected with Leucocytozoon increased with increasing vegetation cover (NDVI) and moisture levels (NDWI), whereas the diversity of parasite lineages decreased with increasing NDVI. Infection rates and parasite diversity also tended to be higher in cooler regions and higher latitudes. Whereas temperature partially constrains Leucocytozoon diversity and infection rates, landscape features, such as vegetation cover and water body availability, play a significant role in modulating the probability of a bird being infected. This suggests that, for Leucocytozoon, the barriers to host shifting and parasite host range expansion are jointly determined by environmental filtering and landscape, but not by host phylogeny. Our results show that integrating host traits, host ancestry, bioclimatic data and microhabitat characteristics that are important for vector reproduction are imperative to understand and predict infection prevalence and diversity of vector-transmitted parasites. Unlike other vector-transmitted diseases, our results show that Leucocytozoon diversity and prevalence will likely decrease with warming temperatures.

TI  - Identification of iron-bearing minerals based on HySpex hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our research group built a super-low altitude detection platform with power delta wings and mounted it with a HySpex hyperspectral sensor. This platform has great potential for extracting alteration information as it can provide high spectral and spatial resolution images. The aim of this study is to verify the reliability and accuracy of alteration information extraction using this platform. The seven-scene hyperspectral images of the Karatagh region in Hami of Xinjiang obtained by the platform in September 2017 were used to identify iron-bearing minerals. First, these images were preprocessed by splicing, atmospheric correction, and geometric correction. Second, the images were compared with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) standard spectra of similarities between the end-member spectra of goethite-, limonite-, and jarosite-altered minerals. Third, the three altered minerals were mapped in the test area based on the end-member spectrum. The results show that the correlations between the end-member spectra of three altered minerals, including goethite, limonite, and jarosite, obtained from the HySpex image and corresponding spectra in USGS reach 0.92873, 0.95098, and 0.8875, respectively. The end-member spectral reflectance values were higher than those in the spectral library. The original spectral data after the continuum-removal and the local quantitative display show that the spectrum at the feature absorption location was similar to the reference spectrum. On this basis, the distribution maps of goethite, limonite, and jarosite iron-stained altered minerals in the Hami Gobi area were produced and field verified. The data show that the information of identified minerals from the HySpex hyperspectral data were in accordance with the actual situation. Both methods can recognize jarosite well, the spectral angular mapping method is better than the back propagation (BP) neural network for goethite recognition, and the BP neural network of limonite recognition is better than the spectral angular mapping method. The above results prove that the alteration information can be effectively identified using the HySpex hyperspectral data integrated on a super-low altitude detection platform, which is of great significance to the rapid delineation of minerogenic prospects area.

TI  - Recent fluorescence imaging technology applications of indocyanine green in general thoracic surgery
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Review
AB  - Thoracic surgeons perform a wide variety of cancer operations, which are often associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, thoracic surgery involves many special challenges that require innovative solutions. The increased utilization of minimally invasive practices, poor overall cancer survival, and significant morbidity of critical operations remain key obstacles to overcome. Fluorescence imaging technology (FIT), involving the implementation of fluorescent dyes and imaging systems, is currently used as an adjunct for general thoracic surgery in many situations and includes sentinel lymph node mapping, pulmonary intersegmental plane identification, pulmonary nodule identification, pulmonary bullous lesion detection, evaluation of the anastomotic perfusion after tracheal surgery, and thoracic duct imaging for postoperative chylothorax. This technology enhances the surgeon's ability to perform operations, and has specific advantages. We review some of the key studies that demonstrate the applications of FIT in the field of general thoracic surgery, focusing on the use of indocyanine green.

TI  - Organization of dust storms and synoptic-scale transport of dust by Kelvin waves
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the large-scale transport of dust driven by the winds parallel to the mountains in the Harmattan, Saudi Arabian, and Bodele Depression dust storm cases, a detailed study of the generation of Kelvin waves and its possible role in organizing these dust storms and large-scale dust transport was accomplished. For this study, observational and numerical model analyses were done in an in depth manner. For this, MERRA reanalysis data sets; WRF-simulated high-resolution variables; MODIS Aqua and Terra images; EUMETSAT images; NAAPS aerosol modeling plots; and MERRA-2 dust scattering aerosol optical depth (AOD) modeling plots, surface observations, and rawinsonde soundings were analyzed for each of these three case studies. We found that there were meso-beta-scale (horizontal length scale of 20-200 km) adjustment processes resulting in Kelvin waves only in the Harmattan and the Bodele Depression cases. The Kelvin wave preceded a cold pool accompanying the air behind the large-scale cold front instrumental in the major dust storm. We find that this Kelvin wave organized the major dust storm in a narrow zone parallel to the mountains before it expanded upscale (meso-alpha to synoptic).

TI  - Emplacement mechanisms of the Tagarma rock avalanche on the Pamir-western Himalayan syntaxis of the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the emplacement mechanisms of rock avalanches, the surficial and internal sedimentological characteristics of avalanche deposits are attracting increased scientific interest. In this study, deposits of the massive paleoseismic Tagarma rock avalanche in the Tarim Basin of the Pamir-western Himalayan syntaxis, China, are investigated to enrich the knowledge on rock avalanche dynamics. Based on a combination of remote sensing data and in situ surveys, a series of typical surficial landforms, including a Toreva block, arc-shaped transverse ridges, aligned megablocks, and longitudinal lineament, are studied in detail. Clusters of superimposed gneiss megablocks preserving the bedrock structures of the source scar are widely distributed along the travel path. Moreover, inverse grading in the deposit and a substrate characterized by clast-supported pebbles with imbricate structures are also observed. Cracks and fissures are common in most pebbles, indicating intense interactions between the avalanche mass and the substrate. Through analysis of these surficial and internal characteristics, we propose that the avalanche mass should have propagated rapidly as a single unit with slight internal mixing and high internal pressure fluctuations. These internal pressure fluctuations obviously exceeded the overburden pressure and contributed to the intense shattering of the main deposit, especially the basal facies. The basal facies was mainly emplaced by a frictional, simple shear process and controlled the avalanche hypermobility. From the proximal to the distal parts, the transport of the avalanche mass can be classified as an extension-dominated sliding process in the transition zone and a compression-dominated sliding process in the accumulation zone.

TI  - Atmospheric correction algorithm over coastal and inland waters based on the red and NIR bands: application to Landsat-8/OLI and VNREDSat-1/NAOMI observations
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water pixel extraction and correction of the atmospheric signal represent prerequisite steps prior to applying algorithms dedicated to the assessment of water quality of natural surface water bodies. The recent multiplication of medium spatial resolution sensors (10-60 m) provides the required constellation to monitoring bio-optical and biogeochemical parameters of surface waters at the relevant spatial-temporal scales. Here we present a new approach to identify water pixels and to extract the atmospheric contribution to the top of atmosphere signal measured by the NAOMI sensor on board the first Vietnamese satellite, VNREDSat-1. After verifying the TOA calibration of NAOMI through a vicarious calibration exercise, we adapt a recent water pixel extraction algorithm (WIPE) to NAOMI, and develop a new atmospheric correction algorithm (referred to as red-NIR) based on the use of the red and NIR bands (the only bands available tbr that purpose on NAOMI) and spectral relationships. The evaluation of red-NIR with a match-up data set gathering remote sensing reflectance, R-rs, measurements performed at the AERONET-OC stations in moderately turbid waters indicates excellent performance in the blue and green part of the spectrum (similar to the performances reached by the SeaDAS NIR-SWIR algorithms) and lower accuracy in the red. Intercomparison of simultaneous images collected by NAOMI and OLI over a more turbid water body shows an excellent agreement between the NAOMI-R-rs estimated by the present processing, and the OLI-R-rs estimated from the ACOLITE algorithm. This approach will allow sensors that do not have SWIR bands, such as SPOT-6 and -7, to be processed, making their data exploitation available for long-term temporal analyses.

TI  - The response of potato crop to the spatiotemporal variability of soil compaction under centre pivot irrigation system
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture techniques were employed to study the impact of the spatiotemporal variations of soil compaction on the performance of potato crop during its various growth stages. The study has been conducted on a 30 ha centre pivot irrigated potato field, located in Wadi Al-Dawasir area in Saudi Arabia. In situ soil compaction measurements were collected, in conjunction with Sentinel-2A satellite data, and correlated spatiotemporally against potato crop growth and yield parameters. The univariate and bivariate Moran's function (Moran's I), the linear regression and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques were used to analyse the data and examine the interrelationships. The spatial correlations between the measured variables revealed high clustering, producing Moran's I of 0.87, 0.79 and 0.57 for soil compaction, yield and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), respectively. Compaction-yield relationship revealed a relatively high significant negative spatial correlation (Moran's I = 0.68). While, the spatial correlation between the average values of compaction and NDVI has negatively produced a Moran's I value of 0.45 (at 0.001 significance level), when 999 permutations were tested for all relationships. A significant positive correlation was observed between high compaction and high proportion of small size tubers, with R-2 and P > F values of 0.65 and .0001, respectively. In contrast, a significant negative correlation has been obtained between high compaction and high proportion of large size tubers, with R-2 and P > F values of 0.57 and .0001, respectively. Understanding the causes of disparity in the productivity of agricultural fields will help decision-makers and farmers to take proactive actions towards better agricultural practices.

TI  - Impact of aerosols on terrestrial gross primary productivity in North China using an improved boreal ecosystem productivity simulator with satellite-based aerosol optical depth
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols can alter the direct and diffuse components of global solar radiation, which further influences terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) via photosynthesis. To investigate the impact of aerosols on GPP, GPP is modeled using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) under two aerosol scenarios (S1& S2) over cropland and grassland ecosystems in the highly polluted North China. In S1, the aerosol-effect is not considered and an original empirical method is used when estimating direct and diffuse solar radiation in BEPS. In S2, BEPS is improved by a new empirical method which incorporates the impact of aerosols using the remote sensing-based aerosol optical depth (AOD). Results suggest that aerosols can reduce GPP of the sunlit leaves by decreasing direct solar radiation, but increase GPP of the shaded leaves by increasing diffuse solar radiation. The impact of aerosols on GPP is more significant over the cropland ecosystem (p < 0.05) with a more complex canopy structure during the peak period of the growing season. Furthermore, an AOD value of 0.3-0.6 with a diffuse fraction (the fraction of diffuse solar radiation in global solar radiation) around 30-40% can largely increase total GPP over the cropland ecosystem. The study improves the accuracy of GPP modeling using BEPS by highlighting the aerosol-effect on GPP via solar radiation over highly polluted regions.

TI  - ICESat-2 Surface Height and Sea Ice Freeboard Assessed With ATM Lidar Acquisitions From Operation IceBridge
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface height and total freeboard from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2, IS-2) sea ice data products (ATL07/ATL10) are assessed with near-coincident retrievals from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar in four dedicated underflights during the 2019 Operation IceBridge Arctic deployment. Over a mix of seasonal and older ice, we find remarkable correlations between the ATM and IS-2 height profiles and roughness (in ninety-nine 10-km segments) that averages to >0.95 and > 0.97, respectively. Regression slopes near unity, between 0.93 and 0.99, indicate close agreement of the height estimates. Larger differences between the surface heights are seen in rougher areas where it is more difficult for the photon heights (used in IS-2 surface finding) to capture the surface distributions at short length scales. Total freeboard in 10-km segments, calculated using three different approaches, show variability of 0.02 to 0.04 m. Sources of residual variance, attributable to differences between the two instruments, are discussed.

TI  - Landslide mapping using optical and radar data: a case study from Aminteo, Western Macedonia Greece
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide mapping is one of the most important steps which take place in the early stages of a landslide survey, contributing to the immediate assessment of slide's effects. Nowadays in this direction, different remote sensing techniques have been developed providing effective results. This work deals with the exploitation of optical data as well as radar data aiming at the mapping of a landslide area located in Western Macedonia, Greece. The landslide occurred in June 2017 at the lignite open pit mine of Aminteo. In that context Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data were acquired in order to be processed appropriately for the imprinting of disturbed areas. In particular, Sentinel-1 images before and after the landslide were processed interferometrically, yielding to the estimation of vertical displacements. Concerning optical data, the images were submitted to diverse digital processing techniques the results were visualized in GIS environment. The derived results were compared and evaluated for their accuracy and identification. It is worth mentioning that the specific methodology may also be applied to more extensive landslides or landslides triggered by different factors. Additionally, it could be assumed that the methodology can be applied to mass movements as a result of earthquakes.

TI  - High-temporal-resolution water level and storage change data sets for lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during 2000-2017 using multiple altimetric missions and Landsat-derived lake shoreline positions
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as Asia's water tower, is quite sensitive to climate change, which is reflected by changes in hydrologic state variables such as lake water storage. Given the extremely limited ground observations on the TP due to the harsh environment and complex terrain, we exploited multiple altimetric missions and Landsat satellite data to create high-temporal-resolution lake water level and storage change time series at weekly to monthly timescales for 52 large lakes (50 lakes larger than 150 km(2) and 2 lakes larger than 100 km(2)) on the TP during 2000-2017. The data sets are available online at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.898411 (Li et al., 2019). With Landsat archives and altimetry data, we developed water levels from lake shoreline positions (i.e., Landsat-derived water levels) that cover the study period and serve as an ideal reference for merging multisource lake water levels with systematic biases being removed. To validate the Landsat-derived water levels, field experiments were carried out in two typical lakes, and theoretical uncertainty analysis was performed based on high-resolution optical images (0.8 m) as well. The RMSE of the Landsat-derived water levels is 0.11 m compared with the in situ measurements, consistent with the magnitude from theoretical analysis (0.1-0.2 m). The accuracy of the Landsat-derived water levels that can be derived in relatively small lakes is comparable with most altimetry data. The resulting merged Landsat-derived and altimetric lake water levels can provide accurate information on multiyear and short-term monitoring of lake water levels and storage changes on the TP, and critical information on lake overflow flood monitoring and prediction as the expansion of some TP lakes becomes a serious threat to surrounding residents and infrastructure.

TI  - A relict habitat became an isolated habitat in the Luoshan Nature Reserve from 1977 to 2017: Natural or man-made disaster?
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the ecological trends of the relict habitats in the Luoshan Nature Reserve (LNR) has an important role in the persistence of endangered species and the socio-economic sustainability in the Ningxia section of the arid desertification belt in North China. Based on data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS)/Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors (from 1977 to 2017), the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and net primary productivity (NPP) (from 2000 to 2017), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), annual average air temperature and precipitation (from 1977 to 2017), typical anthropogenic factors (population size, cultivated land and residential area) and natural ecological elements (MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI/MODIS NDVI and NPP) were quantitatively contrasted and analyzed for potential correlations. Some indicators of human activities, ecological processes and landscape geography have changed in the LNR. The proportion of residential area increased 3.09-fold from 1977 to 2017. The population increased 34.30-fold due to ecological immigration policy implementation in the Hongsipu immigration district. Before immigration, cultivated land increased, but after immigration, this land decreased quickly. Most of the dry-cultivated land was converted through afforestation and a small part of the land was converted to irrigate cultivation land. We conclude that natural evolution led to the ecological relics, the isolated management to the LNR has objectively created an ecological island that will accelerate inbreeding depression and reduce biodiversity.

TI  - Prior biosphere model impact on global terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes estimated from OCO-2 retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the impact of different state of the art global biospheric CO2 flux models, when applied as prior information, on inverse model "top-down" estimates of terrestrial CO2 fluxes obtained when assimilating Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (000-2) observations. This is done with a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) using synthetic CO2 column-average dry air mole fraction (XCO2) retrievals sampled at the OCO-2 satellite spatiotemporal frequency. The OSSEs utilized a 4-D variational (4D-Var) assimilation system with the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (CTM) to estimate CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes using synthetic OCO-2 observations. The impact of biosphere models in inverse model estimates of NEE is quantified by conducting OSSEs using the NASA-CASA, CASA-GFED, SiB-4, and LPJ models as prior estimates and using NEE from the multi-model ensemble mean of the Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project as the "truth". Results show that the assimilation of simulated XCO2 retrievals at OCO-2 observing modes over land results in posterior NEE estimates which generally reproduce "true" NEE globally and over terrestrial TransCom-3 regions that are well-sampled. However, we find larger spread among pos- terior NEE estimates, when using different prior NEE fluxes, in regions and seasons that have limited OCO-2 observational coverage and a large range in "bottom-up" NEE fluxes. Seasonally averaged posterior NEE estimates had standard deviations (SD) of similar to 10 % to similar to 50 % of the multi-modelmean NEE for different TransCom-3 land regions with significant NEE fluxes (regions/seasons with a NEE flux >= 0.5 PgC yr(-1)). On a global average, the seasonally averaged residual impact of the prior model NEE assumption on the posterior NEE spread is similar to 10 %-20 % of the posterior NEE mean. Additional OCO-2 OSSE simulations demonstrate that posterior NEE estimates are also sensitive to the assumed prior NEE flux uncertainty statistics, with spread in posterior NEE estimates similar to those when using variable prior model NEE fluxes. In fact, the sensitivity of posterior NEE estimates to prior error statistics was larger than prior flux values in some regions/times in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere where sufficient OCO-2 data were available and large differences between the prior and truth were evident. Overall, even with the availability of spatiotemporally dense 000-2 data, noticeable residual differences (up to similar to 20 %-30 % globally and 50 % regionally) in posterior NEE flux estimates remain that were caused by the choice of prior model flux values and the specification of prior flux uncertainties.

TI  - A Prospective Validation Cohort Study of a Prediction Model on Non-sentinel Lymph Node Involvement in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Early breast cancer with one or two sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) may omit axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) if followed by radiotherapy. However, only less than one-third of the patients have positive non-SLNs and can truly benefit from radiotherapy. Before any regional treatment decision, the risk of non-SLN metastasis must be identified. The authors previously developed a predictive model for non-SLN involvement using CK19 mRNA and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) score in a training set. They designed a further study to evaluate the predictive effect using the model prospectively in a validation set of one or two involved SLNs. Methods This study identified early breast cancer patients at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from July 2017 to June 2018. The CK19 mRNA tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and CEUS scores were collected before surgery. Patients with one or two involved SLNs were enrolled and underwent ALND. The estimated percentage of non-SLN involvement was calculated by the authors' model formula and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram. The false-negative rates, predictive accuracy, and area under curve (AUC) were compared between two predictive models. Results The study enrolled 235 patients, and 35.36% (83/235) of them had non-SLN involvement. The authors' model had a false-negative rate of 6% and an accuracy of 94.9%. The AUC was 0.952 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.922-0.982), which was significantly higher than that of the MSKCC model at all three cutoff value levels. Conclusion The authors' model, using CK19 mRNA and the CEUS score, showed the potential predictive value of non-SLNs before surgery for early breast cancer patients.

TI  - Quality assessment of fusing Sentinel-2 and WorldView-4 imagery on Sentinel-2 spectral band values: a case study of Zagreb, Croatia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion methods aim at fusing low resolution and high-resolution image to obtain a new image that provides new information for the specific application. The main goal of this article is multitemporal Sentinel-2 image fusion using single WorldView-4 satellite image for urban area monitoring. Fusing those images should provide Sentinel-2 image with similar radiometric band value as original Sentinel-2 image, but with a spatial resolution of WorldView-4. Ehlers, Brovey Transform, Modified Intensity-Hue-Saturation, High-Pass Filtering, Hyperspherical Colour Space and Wavelet resolution merge fusion techniques were used for spatial enhancement of Sentinel-2 images. Original and fused images were first compared using standard statistical parameters, mean, median and standard deviation. Image quality analysis was conducted with different objective image quality measures like root mean square error, peak signal to noise ratio, universal image quality index, structural similarity index, relative dimensionless global error, spatial correlation coefficient, relative average spectral error, spectral angle mapper, multi-scale structural similarity index. Using these quality measures helped in determining the spectral and spatial preservation of fused images. Hyperspherical colour space method was selected as the best method for image fusion of Sentinel-2 and WorldView-4 image-based on standard statistical parameters and quality measures.

TI  - A comparison of machine and deep-learning algorithms applied to multisource data for a subtropical forest area classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the integration of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and WorldView-2 (WV2) images to classify the land cover of a subtropical forest area in Southern Brazil. Different deep and machine learning methods were used: one based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and three ensemble methods. We adopted both pixel- (in the case of CNN) and object-based approaches. The results demonstrated that the integration of LiDAR and WV2 data led to a significant increase (7% to 16%) in accuracies for all classifiers, with kappa coefficient (kappa) ranging from 0.74 for the random forest (RF) classifier associated with the WV2 dataset, to 0.92 for the forest by penalizing attributes (FPA) with the full (LiDAR + WV2) dataset. Using the WV2 dataset solely, the best kappa was 0.81 with CNN classifier, while for the LiDAR dataset, the best kappa was 0.8 with the rotation forest (RotF) algorithm. The use of LiDAR data was especially useful for the discrimination of vegetation classes because of the different height properties among them. In its turn, the WV2 data provided better performance for classes with less structure variation, such as field and bare soil. All the classification algorithms had a nearly similar performance: the results vary slightly according to the dataset used and none of the methods achieved the best accuracy for all classes. It was noticed that both datasets (WV2 and LiDAR) even when applied alone achieved good results with deep and machine learning methods. However, the advantages of integrating active and passive sensors were evident. All these methods provided promising results for land cover classification experiments of the study area in this work.

TI  - DAA: Dual LSTMs with adaptive attention for image captioning
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image captioning enables people to better understand images through fine-grained analysis. Recently the encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanism has achieved great achievements in image captioning and visual question answering. In this paper, we propose a new captioning algorithm that integrates two separate LSTM (Long-short Term Memory) networks through an adaptive semantic attention model. Within our approach, the first LSTM network is followed by an attention model, which serves as a visual sentinel can flexibly make a trade off between the visual semantic region and textual content. Another LSTM is used as a language model, which combines the hidden state representation of the first LSTM and attention context vector, then outputs the word sequence. The proposed model has been extensively evaluated on two large-scale datasets: MSCOCO and Flickr30k. Experimental results show that the proposed method pays more attention to visual salient regions and achieves significant performance of prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple evaluation metrics.

TI  - Shelfbreak Downwelling in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The oceanographic response and atmospheric forcing associated with downwelling along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea shelf/slope is described using mooring data collected from August 2002 to September 2004, along with meteorological time series, satellite data, and reanalysis fields. In total, 55 downwelling events are identified with peak occurrence in July and August. Downwelling is initiated by cyclonic low-pressure systems displacing the Beaufort High and driving westerly winds over the region. The shelfbreak jet responds by accelerating to the east, followed by a depression of isopycnals along the outer shelf and slope. The storms last 3.25 +/- 1.80 days, at which point conditions relax toward their mean state. To determine the effect of sea ice on the oceanographic response, the storms are classified into four ice seasons: open water, partial ice, full ice, and fast ice (immobile). For a given wind strength, the largest response occurs during partial ice cover, while the most subdued response occurs in the fast ice season. Over the 2-year study period, the winds were strongest during the open water season; thus, the shelfbreak jet intensified the most during this period and the cross-stream Ekman flow was largest. During downwelling, the cold water fluxed off the shelf ventilates the upper halocline of the Canada Basin. The storms approach the Beaufort Sea along three distinct pathways: a northerly route from the high Arctic, a westerly route from northern Siberia, and a southerly route from south of Bering Strait. Differences in the vertical structure of the storms are presented as well.

TI  - Drought monitoring and assessment using Landsat TM/OLI data in the agricultural lands of Bandar-e-Turkmen and Gomishan cities, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating agricultural drought is very important in semiarid areas, and it has a significant impact on people's livelihood, which depends on farming. This research tried to examine the capability of six Landsat surface reflectance bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and drought indices (DIs) for drought monitoring in the agricultural lands of Bandar-e-Turkmen and Gomishan cities in 1986 and 2015. Statistical analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and correlation matrices between the VIs and DIs with land surface temperature (LST) were monitored separately for each date. In addition, the spatial and temporal drought extents using the Standardized Evapotranspiration Precipitation Index (SPEI) and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) approaches were determined and compared for both study periods. The correlations between the LST and VIs were negative and significant in both study periods. The range of VI values decreased with increasing temperature in 2015 compared to 1986. The mean surface reflectance of the visible bands (blue, green, red), NIR (near-infrared), SWIR (shortwave infrared), and MWIR (mid-wave infrared) increased in 2015 compared to 1986. A higher spectral reflectance of the visible bands indicated a reduction in vegetation cover or increase in stress in 2015 compared to 1986. Meanwhile, the SWIR and MWIR bands showed that the average surface reflectance increased in 2015, while they showed a lower reflectance in 1986. The results of the Water Supplying Vegetation Index (WSVI) implied that the crop water stress in 2015 was more than that in 1986. The VHIs were separately compared with the NDVI and LST in each period of study. The maximum LST increased from 38 degrees C in 1986 to 44 degrees C in 2015. The moderate drought extent was 65% in 2015, while the study area did not experience any drought in 1986. The SPEI maps showed that the entire study area experienced moderate drought in 2015, while no drought was observed in 1986. The results showed that the DIs and VIs and the visible, SWIR and MWIR surface reflectance bands can be effectively used by sampling plots in future drought assessment studies. The present study also emphasizes that there is a similarity between traditional and remote sensing methods and indicates that remote sensing data can be effectively used instead of traditional approaches when there is no meteorological station. The results would be useful in food security and sustainable agriculture management plans.

TI  - Mesocosm System to Evaluate BF-MBR Efficacy in Mitigating Oily Wastewater Discharges: an Integrated Study on <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>
T2  - MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the results of recovery efficacy of the system "BioFilm Membrane BioReactor" (BF-MBR), in the treatment of oily contaminated seawaters. To this aim, we proposed a multidisciplinary approach that integrates traditional chemical-physical measures together with the assessment on biological sentinel Mytilus galloprovincialis, maintained in a medium-scale artificial system named mesocosm. The setup included: (1) a mesocosm consisting of uncontaminated seawater; (2) a mesocosm composed of an untreated oily wastewater discharge; and (3) a mesocosm receiving the same oily wastewater previously treated by a BF-MBR pilot scale plant. The multidisciplinary approach that included traditional chemical measures on mesocosms together with the evaluation of morphological organization, mRNA expression of those genes involved in cellular stress response, immunohistochemistry and metabolomic analysis on mussel tissues, was able to provide a robust and holistic evidence of how the proposed treatment is able to reduce the overall impact of oily wastewater discharges on the marine ecosystem.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of the vegetation in Ningxia, China using MODIS imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (henceforth, Ningxia) of north-western China plays an important role in guarding regional ecological safety and sustainable development. However, it is unclear how climate affects vegetation growth in terms of seasonality and various vegetation types in Ningxia. Based on remote sensing vegetation index from 2001 to 2016, climatic parameters, and the Chinese vegetation type data, this article examines the spatiotemporal effects of climate parameters on vegetation. The relative importance to variability in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for different seasons and various vegetated types is also determined. The results demonstrate that the vegetation increased from 2001 to 2016 in Ningxia. The rate of NDVI increase was fastest in summer and slowest in spring. Areas with significant increases in vegetation occurred primarily in the southern mountain, Liupan Mountain, and central arid areas. Degraded vegetation occurred in the Yellow River irrigation area with intense human activity influence. The vegetation in most areas of Ningxia will continue to increase in the future. The sensitivity of vegetation to temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, and wind velocity showed significantly seasonal variability. Sunshine duration and wind velocity were important climatic factors affecting vegetation growth in Ningxia. However, the impact of summer precipitation variation on summer NDVI (SMN) demonstrated a time lag effect. The impact of climate variation on vegetation was distinct among various vegetation types. Moreover, the spatial pattern of vegetation in Ningxia was also impacted by human activities.

TI  - Developing restoration strategies in Jazmurian wetland by remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Jazmurian wetland is located in an endorheic basin at the southern edge of the Dasht-e-Lut. Several factors such as high evaporation, overexploitation of groundwater, dam construction on the rivers feeding the wetland, and the effect of drought and climate changes have caused this wetland to dry out during the recent years. Accordingly, this wetland has become one of the main sources of dust generation in the south east of Iran. In this study, several strategies are adopted to prevent dust loading and restore the wetland. For this purpose, the time series of SMOS surface soil moisture (SMOS SSM) and aerosol optical depth of MODIS (MYD08) were used to determine the critical soil moisture for prevention of dust loading. In addition, the temporal monitoring of wetland water area was performed in a 30-year period of 1987-2017 using Landsat Data Series (MSS, TM, ETM +, and OLI). Further, the relationship between wetland water area, rainfall, as well as inflow water the wetland in this period was investigated. Finally, different strategies were evaluated for supplying water to moisten the soil. The results suggested that the rainfall has the most substantial effect on the wetland water area. It was suggested that in order to control the dust loading, the wetland soil moisture content should be equal to the critical soil moisture. Using the SMOS SSM and MYD08, the critical soil moisture content for prevention of dust loading was estimated as 10%. The design of a rainwater catchment system to harvest rainfall and drilling some wells in Jazmurian wetland were the final strategies for restoration of the wetland.

TI  - From religious studies to worldview studies
T2  - RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay uses the 'big questions' embedded in ways of life and implicitly answered in goal directed action to address the future of the study of religion. It locates Religious Studies as a subset of Worldview Studies, defined in terms of big questions, in order to offer an evenhanded basis for comparing religious and nonreligious worldviews. Defining worldviews in terms of big questions highlights the evolved world-making capacities we share with other animals and upends the top-down approach that privileges systematized worldviews. An evolutionary perspective not only links the humanities and the sciences, but also suggests the priority of the nonreflective answers to big questions embedded in lived worldviews and ways of life. It presupposes a critical realist ontology, which embeds constructivism within a naturalistic perspective, and enables a variety of accounts of why things are the way they are that can be grounded (at least distally) in evolutionary theory.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of sentinel polyps and their correlation with proximal colon cancer: A retrospective observational study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDColorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. The relationship between sentinel polyps (rectal polyps with proximal colon cancer) and proximal colon cancer has received extensive attention in recent years. However, there is still no clear conclusion regarding the relationship.AIMTo investigate the clinical characteristics of sentinel polyps and their correlation with proximal colon cancer.METHODSA retrospective analysis of 2587 patients with rectal polyps from January 2006 to December 2017 was performed. According to whether or not proximal colon cancer was diagnosed, the patients were divided into either a sentinel polyp group (192 patients) or a pure rectal polyp group (2395 patients). The endoscopic features, clinicopathological features, therapeutic effects, and short-term prognosis were analyzed and compared between the two groups.RESULTSThe mean age of patients in the sentinel polyp group was generally higher than that of the pure rectal polyp group, and the positivity rates of anemia, stool occult blood, and tumor markers of the sentinel polyp group were also significantly higher than those in the rectal polyp group (chi(2) = 90.56, P < 0.01; chi(2) = 70.30, P < 0.01; chi(2) = 92.80, P < 0.01). The majority of the patients in the sentinel polyp group had multiple polyps, large polyps, adenomatous polyps, or sessile polyps (chi(2) = 195.96, P < 0.01; chi(2) = 460.46, P < 0.01; chi(2) = 94.69, P < 0.01; chi(2) = 48.01, P < 0.01). Most of the proximal colon cancers were Duke's A and B stages in the sentinel polyp group. In the pure rectal polyp group, 2203 patients underwent endoscopic treatment, and all of the patients were cured and discharged. In the sentinel polyp group, 65 patients underwent radical operation, and 61 patients received endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic mucosal resection. Additionally, 21 patients were lost to follow-up after 6-12 mo, and the loss rate was 10.94%. A total of 63.16% of patients experienced remission without tumor recurrence or metastasis, 33.33% of patients experienced tumors regression or improved symptoms, and the other 3.51% of the patients died.CONCLUSIONIf there are multiple, sessile, and adenomatous rectal polyps with a maximum diameter > 1 cm, the possibility of the carcinogenesis of the polyps or of the proximal colon should be monitored closely. These patients should be followed in the short-term and should undergo a whole-colon examination.

TI  - Photoperiod controls vegetation phenology across Africa
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is driven by environmental factors such as photoperiod, precipitation, temperature, insolation, and nutrient availability. However, across Africa, there's ambiguity about these drivers, which can lead to uncertainty in the predictions of global warming impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and their representation in dynamic vegetation models. Using satellite data, we undertook a systematic analysis of the relationship between phenological parameters and these drivers. The analysis across different regions consistently revealed photoperiod as the dominant factor controlling the onset and end of vegetation growing season. Moreover, the results suggest that not one, but a combination of drivers control phenological events. Consequently, to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts, the role of photoperiod should be incorporated into vegetation-climate and ecosystem modelling. Furthermore, it is necessary to define clearly the responses of vegetation to interactions between a consistent photoperiod cue and inter-annual variation in other drivers, especially under a changing climate.

TI  - When Holding in Prevents From Reaching Out: Emotion Suppression and Social Support-Seeking in Multicultural Groups
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Members of multicultural groups benefit from developing diverse social support networks. Engaging openly with people who have a different worldview (i.e., given by a different cultural background) broadens one's cognitive horizons, facilitates one's adaptation to new contexts, decreases stereotyping and discrimination and generally improves individual and group performance. However, if this social connection is hindered (either by limiting the number of people one reaches out to or in terms of preferring to connect to similar others), then the diversity advantage is lost - both for the individuals and for the groups. Through two case studies of professional groups with varying cultural diversity (moderate and superdiverse), we investigate the evolution of their members' social support networks (i.e., to what extent and to whom they reach out for support) depending on (1) individuals' habitual emotion suppression and (2) cultural orientation on the individualism-collectivism dimension. Results show that individualistic cultures suffer a double-whammy: when suppressing, their members seek less support (i.e., don't reach out so much to ask for support) and tend to seek culturally similar others for it when they do. Suppressing collectivists are less affected in absolute levels of connectedness, but still prefer culturally similar others as sources of support. Our study offers an emotion-based view of why people stick together with similar others in diverse groups and how learning to better cope with emotions can make us more open-minded toward diversity in professional settings.

TI  - [Application of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in colorectal cancer surgery].
T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been widely used in surgery. In colorectal surgery specifically, more and more studies have shown that intraoperative fluorescence imaging is a safe and feasible method to assess anastomotic perfusion, and its use may decrease the incidence of anastomotic leakage. Meanwhile, indocyanine green can also be used to mark the location of lesion, identify sentinel lymph nodes, protect the ureter, and so on. It can also provide detection and guidance in the operation of peritoneal metastasis and liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. The application of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging can offer great value for surgery through improving the accuracy and outcomes of oncological resections. According to existing studies, we are still at an early application stage of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging technology in colorectal surgery. Lacking prospective randomized controlled studies, neither standards nor guidelines for injection dosage, site and observation period are satisfactory. Therefore, deep researches and establishment of standardized operational procedure are required to enhance the safety and accuracy of tumor resection and improve outcomes.
AB  - 吲哚菁绿（ICG）荧光显像技术在外科手术中的应用十分广泛。越来越多的研究表明，在结直肠手术的吻合口血供评估中，术中荧光显像是一种安全可行的方法，该技术的应用有可能会降低吻合口漏的发生率。同时，ICG亦可用于标记病灶位置、辨识前哨淋巴结、保护输尿管等；甚至可在结直肠癌腹膜转移、肝转移的手术中，提供检测和指导作用。ICG荧光显像技术可提高肿瘤切除的准确性，改善预后，为结直肠外科手术带来巨大获益。同时，从现有的研究来看，ICG荧光显像技术在结直肠癌手术中的应用尚处在初级阶段，荧光显像应用的剂量、注射部位、观察时间等尚无标准及规范可循，多缺乏前瞻性的随机对照研究。因此，有必要对该项技术进行深入的研究，建立标准化的操作规范，提高肿瘤切除的安全性和准确性，改善患者预后。.

TI  - Land suitability analysis for maize production in Indonesia using satellite remote sensing and GIS-based multicriteria decision support system
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is one of the potential crops can help in regional food production with self-sufficiency of foods in the drought prone areas of East Java in Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to determine the lands that are suitable for sustainable maize production in some selected areas of East Java by using various spatial and remote sensing datasets. The methodology was divided into three stages: first, the Landsat 8 operational land imagery satellite datasets were processed to create layers for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and land surface temperature. For the proposed multicriteria analysis, another seven criteria: distance from roads, distance from rivers, slope, land cover, elevation levels, soil types and rainfall, were considered. Second, a spatial analysis was performed to identify highly suitable areas for maize production using a geographical extent and multicriteria analysis. Third, the criteria were determined using land suitability information for a 5-year period. The land suitability analysis with equal weight showed that 70.8% of the land (136,663 ha) was highly suitable, 26.3% of the land (50,872 ha) was moderately suitable, and 2.8% of the land (5391 ha) was marginally suitable. On the other hand, expert knowledge was also considered using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and indicated that 64.9% of the land (125,216 ha) was highly suitable, 30.4% of the land (58,828 ha) was moderately suitable, and 4.5% (8603 ha) of the land was marginally suitable. The yield estimation was determined for the highly suitable areas with NDVI (R-2 = 77.81%) and SAVI (R-2 = 72.8%). The regression analysis was incorporated to predicted yield of maize. This research recommends that satellite remote sensing, GIS and AHP-based multicriteria analysis can be extended for agricultural extension services to select suitable lands for increasing maize production.

TI  - Global humid tropics forest structural condition and forest structural integrity maps
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed maps of global forest extent are widely used for conservation assessment and planning. Yet, there is increasing recognition that these efforts must now include elements of forest quality for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Such data are not yet available globally. Here we introduce two data products, the Forest Structural Condition Index (SCI) and the Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII), to meet this need for the humid tropics. The SCI integrates canopy height, tree cover, and time since disturbance to distinguish short, open-canopy, or recently deforested stands from tall, closed-canopy, older stands typical of primary forest. The SCI was validated against estimates of foliage height diversity derived from airborne lidar. The FSII overlays a global index of human pressure on SCI to identify structurally complex forests with low human pressure, likely the most valuable for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. These products represent an important step in maturation from conservation focus on forest extent to forest stands that should be considered "best of the last" in international policy settings.

TI  - Bisupervised network with pyramid pooling module for land cover classification of satellite remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is a significant task in remote sensing that aims at land cover monitoring and adjustment. Instance segmentation in deep learning has been widely used in land cover classification. However, this method requires high quality, labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. A bisupervised pipeline is proposed especially for datasets with ambiguous samples, which reduces the requirement of labeling accuracy. In order to supervise learning with ambiguous annotation samples, the pipeline has two losses to feedback, namely main loss and auxiliary loss. The main loss is still responsible for the expected output. According to the difference degree between ambiguous samples, categories are constructed artificially. The auxiliary loss generates feedback through categories, sharing decoder layers of main output during the training process. In the prediction process, auxiliary loss is used to update the main loss results. The neural network adopts the structure of U-Net with the pyramid pooling module, in which the multiscale feature is used in the feature extraction process. We also compare five different backbones and choose Inception-V3 as the backbone to improve the feature extraction capabilities of network encoders. The use of transposed convolution instead of traditional upsampling in decoders can improve the segmentation details. Our bisupervise network obtains Jaccard index of 83.936% and F1 -score of 91.17% on Gaofen-2 imagery dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better classification performance in datasets with ambiguous annotations.

TI  - Change in regional land subsidence in Beijing after south-to-north water diversion project observed using satellite radar interferometry
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over-exploitation of groundwater has caused severe land subsidence in Beijing during the past two decades. Since the middle route of South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), the biggest water diversion project in China, started to deliver water to Beijing in December 2014, the groundwater shortage has been greatly alleviated. This study aims to analyze the impact of SNWDP on the spatiotemporal evolution of land subsidence in Beijing. Change in surface displacement in Beijing after SNWDP was retrieved and the spatiotemporal patterns of the change were analyzed based on long time-series Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) (2004-2010), Radarsat-2 (2011-2014), and Sentinel-1 (2015-2017) satellite datasets using Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) techniques. Land subsidence unevenness index (LSUI) was proposed to represent the spatial unevenness of surface displacement. PS-Time approach was then adapted to examine the time series evolution of LSUI. The results showed that the InSAR measurements agree well with leveling measurements with R-2 over 0.96. Although the maximum annual displacement rate reached -159.7 mm/year by 2017, over 57% of the area within 25 mm/year contour line showed decreasing or unchanged displacement rate after the south-north water delivered to Beijing. The settlement rate in Chaoyang-Dongbalizhuang (CD) subsidence center has decreased for 26 mm/year from 2011-2014 to 2015-2017. Only around 15% of the area experienced continued accelerating settlement rate through the three time periods, which was mainly located in the area with the compressible layer thickness over 190 m, while the magnitude of velocity increment considerably decreased after SNWDP. Land subsidence unevenness, represented by LSUI, developed more slowly after SNWDP than that during 2011-2014. However, LSUI at the edge of settlement funnel has kept developing and reached 1.7 parts per thousand in 2017. Decreasing groundwater level decline after SNWDP and the positive relationship (R-2 > 0.74) between land subsidence and groundwater level clearly showed impacts of SNWDP on the alleviating land subsidence. Other reasons include geological background, increasing precipitation, and strict water management policies implemented during these years.

TI  - Tangled Worldview Model of Opinion Dynamics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the joint evolution of worldviews by proposing a model of opinion dynamics, which is inspired in notions from evolutionary ecology. Agents update their opinion on a specific issue based on their propensity to change-asserted by the social neighbors-weighted by their mutual similarity on other issues. Agents are, therefore, more influenced by neighbors with similar worldviews (set of opinions on various issues), resulting in a complex co-evolution of each opinion. Simulations show that the worldview evolution exhibits events of intermittent polarization when the social network is scale-free. This, in turn, triggers extreme crashes and surges in the popularity of various opinions. Using the proposed model, we highlight the role of network structure, bounded rationality of agents, and the role of key influential agents in causing polarization and intermittent reformation of worldviews on scale-free networks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of surface water quality parameters (SWQPs) from satellite imagery is a cost-effective method. Remote sensing algorithms are developed to map the relationship between satellite reflectance and concentrations of SWQPs. This study exploited principal component analysis (PCA) to decorrelate multispectral bands prior to developing algorithms for SWQPs. Landsat-8 surface reflectances are first achieved, then, principal components are extracted to develop algorithms for turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS). The developed Landsat-8-based-PCA technique enhanced the accuracy of retrieving concentrations of turbidity and TSS by 12.585% and 12.626%, respectively. These findings demonstrated the significant use of Landsat-8-based-PCA technique to consider/estimate other SWQPs.

TI  - Mass Balance Assessment of the Amery Ice Shelf Basin, East Antarctica
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) System is the largest glacial system in East Antarctica. Accurate estimation of its mass balance is imperative for reducing the uncertainty in evaluating the sea-level contribution from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the mass balance of the AIS basin. We measured the ice velocity with Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar data acquired in 2016. The ice thickness data from the radio echo-sounding measurements were combined with the surface mass balance data from the new Regional Atmospheric Climate Model, from which the mass balance of the AIS basin was estimated. Our estimates suggest a slight positive mass balance of 3.1 +/- 9.4 Gt/year in 2016. We found that the short-term fluctuations in the surface mass balance dramatically affect the AIS mass balance. A comparison with previous estimates confirms the long-term positive mass balance trend.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based evaluations of change in vegetation phenology have been explored extensively but land cover-specific climate factors driving these anomalous changes are not fully understood in northern Sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we identified the climatic factors controlling the start of the season (SOS) extracted from GIMMS NDVI from 1988 to 2013 with onset of rainy season (ORS), annual mean temperature (Temp) and precipitation (PP) through the stepwise regression analysis. The results showed that the SOS shifted towards a late onset in a northward direction with distinct earlier and later trends in grassland and cropland, respectively. The stepwise regression has successfully built a model between SOS and its drivers in 46.0% of the total pixels, where its primary factor differed regionally across land covers. The ORS explained the local anomalous SOS change primarily at 44.7% of the pixels where the model was built. Although the ORS was the primary dominant factor in savannah and cropland, the Temp and PP were leading in grassland and shrubland, respectively, and all factors contributed evenly in evergreen forest. The difference of land cover-specific primary factor implicates complex process in dependency of local vegetation phenology on physiological traits and climate regime across land cover in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Land cover classification of multispectral remote sensing images based on time-spectrum association features and multikernel boosting incremental learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, land cover classification technology based on multispectral remote sensing images has been applied to many fields of environmental monitoring. The existing methods generally rely on the information of spectral bands. However, the spectral information of monotemporal multispectral images cannot be generalized to describe the spectral characteristics of the ground objects at different times. In addition, the time-series samples will slightly change over time, and it is difficult to maintain classification performance continuously. To address these problems, we propose a method of land cover classification for multispectral images based on the time-spectrum association feature and multikernel boosting incremental learning. Our method is conducted in two main stages. (1) We propose the time-spectrum association features to acquire the seasonal spectral characteristics different ground objects. (2) To design the classifiers, we propose multikernel boosting method and introduce a multikernel boosting classification learning, which uses continuous new samples to update the weights of the classifier by low-computational and small-scale incremental learning. We test the proposed method on a public multispectral dataset from Landsat-5. The experimental results show that the extracted time-spectrum association features can better characterize the differences of different ground objects, and the proposed classifier can reach more accurate classification with gradually increasing samples over time.

TI  - Preoperative morphological diagnosis of axillary lymph nodes in a breast center consultation service: evaluation of fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy techniques
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Preoperative routine examination of axillary lymph nodes (ALN) in breast cancer patients is carried out physically and by ultrasound imaging; unsuspicious nodes will lead to a sentinel node (SN) procedure, suspicious ones require axillary dissection (AD). Pre-operative biopsy techniques like fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy (CB) may reduce the number of false "suspicious" cases and prevent overtreatment. We evaluated the effectiveness of both biopsy techniques. Materials and methods After physical and ultrasound examination 241 suspicious ALNs were found in 214 patients. Ultrasound-guided FNA and/or CB procedures were chosen randomly, resulting in 138 FNA and 86 CB. In 17 further events both FNA and CB were employed. The samples were examined in our Cytology lab or in the Pathology Department and the findings correlated with post-operative histological lymph node reports. Patients with histologically proven breast cancer underwent sentinel node biopsy, cytologically or histologically positive FNA/CB-findings prompted ALN dissection. Results Out of 155 FNA samples 34 were not representative (21.9%), 89 showed no tumor cells (57.4%), 30 showed positive tumor cells (19.4%), leaving two missing. All 103 CB showed representative material, positive in 62 (60.2%) and negative in 41 (39.8%) cases. Correlation with histological reports revealed a statistically non-significant advantage for CB over FNA regarding total accuracy (92.9% vs. 78.3%) and sensitivity (92% vs. 73.7%). Conclusions Preoperative CB and alternative FNA are valuable complementary methods of predicting ALN involvement in breast cancer patients and may spare the patient unnecessary ALN dissection.

AB  - The objective of this study is to compare the effect of different spatial resolution of satellite images (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-1) for deriving LULC map and its effects on the performance of HEC-HMS lumped and Flood Hydro distributed models in flood hydrograph simulation in the Ammameh Watershed, Iran. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method was used for considering the rainfall loss rate in both models. The value of curve number was determined based on hydrologic soil groups and produced LULC maps from the satellite images with respect to soil moisture conditions. The performance of HEC-HMS lumped and Flood Hydro distributed models in flood hydrograph simulation was evaluated for 15 and five rainfall-runoff events, respectively. The simulation results of flood hydrographs in validation phase showed that both models provided acceptable results, and there were no significant differences among the results of three remotely sensed images for simulating the flood hydrographs.

TI  - Assessing inconsistency in global land cover products and synthesis of studies on land use and land cover dynamics during 2001 to 2017 in the southeastern region of Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality land use and land cover data are important for monitoring and analyzing environmental changes in the background of global warming. This study assessed the spatial and areal inconsistencies in the four most recent multiresources land cover products in a complex manner using the common classification systems of International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP)-17, IGBP-9, IPCC-5, and TC (vegetation, wetlands, and others only). Based on inconsistencies and multitemporal land cover datasets, a synthesis of the study was triggered out on land use and land cover dynamics during 2001 to 2017 in the southeastern region of Bangladesh. The overall areal and spatial inconsistencies decreased from high to low levels of aggregation (IGBP-17 to TC), indicating that the inconsistencies are not only influenced by the level of thematic detail and landscape complexity but also related to the conversion uncertainties. Overall, areal inconsistency in the comparison of the FROM-GLC and GlobeLand30 datasets was the smallest among the six pairs, whereas the pair of MODISLC and LULC was observed the highest inconsistencies. Based on an overall lower inconsistencies classification system (IGBP-9), the synthetic land use cover changes in the study area were assessed. During the period of study, the areal distribution of forest cover, built-up areas, and water increased annually by 0.4%, 1.32%, and 0.3% respectively, whereas the croplands and wetlands decreased by 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The dynamic changes of croplands, forest, and artificial surface were identified the prime cyclic land cover change. This research is helpful in providing training areas for the producer of land cover products. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Two-dimensional mineral dust radiative effect calculations from CALIPSO observations over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A demonstration study to examine the feasibility of retrieving dust radiative effects based on combined satellite data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) and CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) lidar vertical profiles along their orbit is presented. The GAME (Global Atmospheric Model) radiative transfer model is used to estimate the shortwave and longwave dust radiative effects below the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite) orbit assuming an aerosol parameterization based on the CALIOP vertical distribution at a horizontal resolution of 5 km and additional AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) data. Two study cases are analyzed: a strong long-range transport mineral dust event (aerosol optical depth, AOD, of 0.52) that originated in the Sahara Desert and reached the United Kingdom and a weaker event (AOD = 0.16) that affected eastern Europe. The radiative fluxes obtained are first validated in terms of radiative efficiency at a single point with space-time colocated lidar ground-based measurements from EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) stations below the orbit. The methodology is then applied to the full orbit. The strong dependence of the radiative effects on the aerosol load (and to a lesser extent on the surface albedo) highlights the need for accurate AOD measurements for radiative studies. The calculated dust radiative effects and heating rates below the orbits are in good agreement with previous studies of mineral dust, with the radiative efficiency obtained at the surface ranging between -80.3 and -63.0 W m(-2) for lower dust concentration event and -119.1 and -79.3W m(-2) for the strong event. Thus, results demonstrate the validity of the method presented here to retrieve 2-D accurate radiative properties with large spatial and temporal coverage.

TI  - Modeling stand parameters for <i>Pinus brutia</i> (Ten.) using airborne LiDAR data: a case study in Bergama
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional field measurement methods are usually time-consuming and costly. With recent developments in remote sensing, precise estimation of some key forest parameters is becoming a close reality. One of the robust technologies being utilized for this aim is light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We used LiDAR to derive tree height and canopy density metrics using pixel values, texture features, and vegetation indices obtained from WorldView-3 imagery to estimate volume per hectare, mean height, dominant height, and number of trees per hectare. A total of 58 sample plots, predominantly composed of Pinus brutia, which is one of the most abundant tree species in Turkey, were analyzed. The adjusted R-2 values obtained by the best regression models, using LiDAR-derived metrics alone, were 0.66, 0.73, 0.83, and 0.83 for the volume per hectare, number of trees per hectare, and average and dominant heights, respectively. After integrating LiDAR-derived metrics with WorldView-3 imagery band values and subsequently with vegetation indices, higher adjusted R-2 values of 0.70 and 0.77, respectively, were obtained for the volume per hectare. In contrast, incorporating texture features besides other parameters had no positive effect on the accuracy of estimation. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Comparative study of sea clutter distribution and ship detectors' performance for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar image
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is a classical algorithm for ship detection with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, the algorithm is susceptible to the accuracy of sea clutter modeling and the desired probability of false alarm, thus reducing detection performance. Therefore, a goodness-of-fit test and a certain number of ship detection experiments and theoretical analysis of false alarms have been extensively practiced as prior knowledge. Compared to earlier SAR sensors, the newly launched Sentinel-1 has nearly uniform signal-to-noise ratio, and the distributed-target-ambiguity ratio may provide additional capabilities for ship detection. Owing to the complex interaction between SAR system and sea surface, the previous work may not be completely suitable for Sentinel-1. As its application is in the beginning, further research is needed. We evaluate the effectiveness of model fitting among five commonly used distributions, and the influences of incident angle, polarization, and sea state on modeling are analyzed. In addition, CFAR detectors constructed by these distributions carried out the ship detection experiments. Moreover, the false alarms that are inevitably caused during the ship detection are classified and statistically analyzed. These aforementioned works can provide an important reference for Sentinel-1 to implement large-scale, as well as long-term, ship detection activities and for further improvement.

TI  - Assessment of water storage response to surface hydrological connectivity in a large floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China) using hydrodynamic and geostatistical analysis
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplains play a significant role in affecting the transport of water, dissolved matter and sediments during wide-ranging drying and wetting. This study uses a hydrodynamic model and geostatistical method to explore the variations of water storage and its relationship with the surface hydrological connectivity, exemplified by the large Poyang Lake-floodplain system (in China). The simulations show that the floodplain storage exhibits largely similar behavior to that of the total lake water storage, but the water storage in the main lake is distinctly higher than the floodplains. The lake storage is estimated to be from 20 x 10(8) to 163 x 10(8) m(3) and differs considerably between seasons, and the contribution of the floodplain to the total lake storage varies from 18 to 34%. Geostatistical analysis reveals that the degree of surface hydrological connectivity can be classified as high connectivity in summer, low connectivity in winter, and intermediate connectivity during other seasons. Higher variability of water storage and lower frequency of hydrological connectivity are found in the seasonal floodplains, whereas the lower variability and higher frequency are observed in the main lake, indicating that water storage is inextricably linked to the dynamic behaviors of surface hydrological connectivity. Additionally, the estimated water storage significantly increases from the low and intermediate conditions to the high connectivity condition, mainly due to the key process of the west-east connectivity in controlling lake-floodplain interactions. This study improves understanding of Poyang Lake floodplain behavior and other similar floodplain systems by providing knowledge of water balance, water allocation and water management.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - A Joint Landsat- and MODIS-Based Reanalysis Approach for Midlatitude Montane Seasonal Snow Characterization
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new snow reanalysis method is presented that is designed to jointly assimilate Landsat- and MODIS-derived (MODSCAG) fractional snow covered area (fSCA) to characterize seasonal snow in remote regions like High Mountain Asia (HMA) where in situ data is severely lacking. The method leverages existing readily available global datasets for forcing a snow model and uses the fSCA retrievals along with the ensemble prior model estimates to derive posterior estimates using a Bayesian framework. The method addresses MODIS viewing-geometry effects on the fSCA retrievals by accounting for viewing angle dependent measurement errors and using a CDF-matching technique to improve the joint fSCA measurement consistency before assimilation. The method was verified through comparison with the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates over the Tuolumne River watershed in California. The posterior SWE estimates were shown to be much more consistent with the independent ASO estimates across the three WYs examined. Tests over Tuolumne showed that in cases where sufficient Landsat observations are available (i.e., with multiple sensors and in areas of overlapping Landsat tiles), assimilation of only Landsat data may be optimal, which is attributable primarily to the higher spatial resolution of the raw Landsat data, but that in cases with fewer Landsat measurements (i.e., with single Landsat tiles and/or significant reduction due to clouds), the additional screened and CDF-matched MODIS-based measurements can have a positive (albeit marginal) impact. Illustrative results are presented for nine HMA test tiles to illustrate how the method can provide posterior estimates of the space-time climatology of SWE storage in areas where in situ data does not generally exist. Ongoing work is being conducted to use the method outlined herein to generate an HMA-wide reanalysis dataset that will provide an opportunity for a more thorough characterization of HMA seasonal snow storage and dynamics over the joint Landsat-MODIS era. The method is generalizable to any midlatitude montane region where seasonal snow is important.

TI  - Analysis of temporal and spatial variations of total precipitable water vapor in western Iran using radiosonde and MODIS measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating time series variations of total precipitable water (TPW) vapor is of great importance in meteorology and hydrology. The objective of this study is to use two non-parametric tests including Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator to investigate the annual and seasonal trend of TPW changes using two remote sensing datasets and a ground dataset in western Iran. The daily near-infrared product of TPW from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), MOD05, and a daily TPW extracted from a developed regional TPW MODIS algorithm were considered as remote sensing data. The remote sensing estimations were utilized in six climatic zones, including hyperarid, arid, semiarid, semihumid, humid, and hyperhumid. For the ground data, the daily TPW was prepared from five radiosonde stations. At a significance level of 0.05, in the annual trend, MOD05 results showed a significant increase in the hyperarid, semiarid, semihumid, and hyperhumid climates, and regional MODIS TPW algorithm results showed a significant increase in all six climates. In the seasonal trend of spring in the Ahvaz radiosonde station, as well as in the seasonal trend of summer of MOD05 results in the hyperarid, arid, semihumid, and humid climates, there was a significant increase. Regional MODIS TPW algorithm results demonstrated a significant increase trend in all six climates in the spring and summer. Generally, the results proved the TPW incremental trend in the study area.

TI  - Integrating intraseasonal grassland dynamics in cross-scale distribution modeling to support waterbird recovery plans
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite much discussion about the utility of remote sensing for effective conservation, the inclusion of these technologies in species recovery plans remains largely anecdotal. We developed a modeling approach for the integration of local, spatially measured ecosystem functional dynamics into a species distribution modeling (SDM) framework in which other ecologically relevant factors are modeled separately at broad scales. To illustrate the approach, we incorporated intraseasonal water-vegetation dynamics into a cross-scale SDM for the Common Snipe (Gallinago gallinago), which is highly dependent on water and vegetation dynamics. The Common Snipe is an Iberian grassland waterbird characteristic of European agricultural meadows and a member of one of the most threatened bird guilds. The intraseasonal dynamics of water content of vegetation were measured using the standard deviation of the normalized difference water index time series computed from bimonthly images of the Sentinel-2 satellite. The recovery plan for the Common Snipe in Galicia (northwestern Iberian Peninsula) provided an opportunity to apply our modeling framework. Model accuracy in predicting the species' distribution at a regional scale (resulting from integration of downscaled climate projections with regional habitat-topographic suitability models) was very high (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.981 and Boyce's index of 0.971). Local water-vegetation dynamic models, based exclusively on Sentinel-2 imagery, were good predictors (AUC of 0.849 and Boyce's index of 0.976). The predictive power improved (AUC of 0.92 and Boyce's index of 0.98) when local model predictions were restricted to areas identified by the continental and regional models as priorities for conservation. Our models also performed well (AUC of 0.90 and Boyce's index of 0.93) when projected to updated water-vegetation conditions. Our modeling framework enabled incorporation of key ecosystem processes closely related to water and carbon cycles while accounting for other factors ecologically relevant to endangered grassland waterbirds across different scales, allowed identification of priority areas for conservation, and provided an opportunity for cost-effective recovery planning by monitoring management effectiveness from space.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of 15 automatic thresholding methods, namely Huang and Wang's fuzzy thresholding method, intermode thresholding method, isodata thresholding method, Li and Tam's thresholding method, maximum entropy thresholding method, mean thresholding method, minimum error thresholding method, minimum thresholding method, moment-preserving thresholding method, Otsu' s thresholding method, percentile (p-tile) thresholding method, Renyi' s entropy thresholding method, Shanbhag's thresholding method, triangle thresholding method, and Yen's thresholding method, for mapping water body using Sentinel-2 data based on normalized difference water index. Three different types of surface water bodies, such as a natural lake (Lake Burdur), a dam reservoir (Aslantas Dam Reservoir), and a part of a river (Aras River), are chosen to reveal the potential of 15 thresholding methods. The reference water body maps of each test site were generated by manual digitization of high-resolution Google Earth images. The thresholding methods were assessed using the statistical measures, namely overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and misclassification error (ME). The accuracy analyses of 15 thresholding methods were carried out separately for each test site, and then the overall accuracies were calculated to determine the best method. The obtained OA results showed that minimum thresholding method was the best method among these 15 algorithms with 0.0008 ME, 99.92% OA, and 0.9758 Kappa coefficient. On the other hand, Shanbhag' s method provided the lowest overall accuracies as 0.3133 ME, 68.67% OA, and 0.3190 Kappa coefficient. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Lake surface temperature retrieval from Landsat-8 and retrospective analysis in Karaoun Reservoir, Lebanon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of lake water surface temperature has long been highlighted for ecological and hydrological studies as well as for water quality management. In the absence of regular field observations, satellite remote sensing has been recognized as a cost-effective way to monitor water surface temperature on large spatial and temporal scales. The thermal infrared sensors (TIRS) onboard of Landsat satellites (since 1984) are adequate tools for monitoring surface temperature of small to medium sized lakes with a biweekly frequency, as well as for performing retrospective analysis. Nonetheless, the satellite data have to deal with effects due to the atmosphere so that several approaches to correct for atmospheric contributions have been proposed. Among these are: (i) the radiative transfer equation (RTE); (ii) a single-channel algorithm that depends on water vapor content and emissivity (SC1); (iii) its improved version including air temperature (SC2); and (iv) a monowindow (MW) algorithm that requires emissivity, atmospheric transmissivity, and effective mean atmospheric temperature. We aim to evaluate these four approaches in a river dammed reservoir with a size of 12 km(2) using data gathered from the band 10 of the TIRS onboard of Landsat 8. Satellite-derived temperatures were then compared to in situ data acquired from thermistors at the time of Landsat 8 overpasses. All approaches showed a good performance, with the SC1 algorithm yielding the lowest root mean square error (0.73 K), followed by the SC2 method (0.89 K), the RTE (0.94 K), and then the MW algorithm (1.23 K). Based on the validation results, we then applied the SC1 algorithm to Landsat 4, 5, and 8 thermal data (1984 to 2018) to extend data series to past years. These data do not reveal any warming trend of the reservoir surface temperature. The results of this study also confirm how the 100-m spatial resolution of TIRS is valuable as an additional source of data to field-based monitoring.

TI  - Revealing the Subsurface Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass from Satellite Data Associated with Typhoon Muifa
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant sea surface temperature (SST) drop was clearly identified to be confined exactly over the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM) from satellite-derived SSTs during Typhoon Muifa's passage over the Yellow Sea (YS) in early August 2011. With a simple one-dimensional mixed-layer model (Price-Weller-Pinkel [PWP]), the mixed-layer heat budget diagnosis concluded that the entrainment term, rather than the surface heat flux term that usually dominates over the open ocean, was the dominant process for the significant SST cooling over the YSCWM. The PWP-based experiments were conducted to set up one lookup table including the SST drop, wind speed, and subsurface temperature gradient, from which the YSCWM's intensity (represented by the subsurface temperature gradient) can be easily found with the satellite wind and SST measurements during the typhoon passage over the YS. This YSCWM-anchored significant SST drop provides a promising possibility to detect the YSCWM intensity and extent, which have generally been poorly sampled to date.

Male and female T. areolatus were sampled from four sites in January 2015 differently impacted by human activities. In males, but not females, hepatic gene expression of heat shock protein (HSP70) and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) were significantly elevated at the site adjacent to the small city of Salamanca, relative to the other sites. In females, hepatic HSP70, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), and the estrogen responsive genes, vitellogenin (VTG) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), were significantly lower at the site located furthest downstream. A similar downstream pattern of lower expression levels also was found in ovarian tissue for the genes, HSP70 and ER alpha. Gill gene expression showed a unique pattern in females as levels of metallothionein were elevated at the site furthest downstream. While analytical chemistry of water samples provided limited evidence of agrichemical contamination, the gene expression data are consistent with an exposure to agrichemicals and metals. T. areolatus may be a valuable sentinel organism and its use as a bioindicator species in some rivers within Chile can provide considerable insight, particularly in situations analytical chemistry is limited by environmental constraints.

TI  - Urban tree classification using discrete-return LiDAR and an object-level local binary pattern algorithm
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees have the potential to mitigate some of the harm brought about by rapid urbanization and population growth, as well as serious environmental degradation (e.g. soil erosion, carbon pollution and species extirpation), in cities. This paper presents a novel urban tree extraction modelling approach that uses discrete laser scanning point clouds and object-based textural analysis to (1) develop a model characterised by four sub-models, including (a) height-based split segmentation, (b) feature extraction, (c) texture analysis and (d) classification, and (2) apply this model to classify urban trees. The canopy height model is integrated with the object-level local binary pattern algorithm (LBP) to achieve high classification accuracy. The results of each sub-model reveal that the classification of urban trees based on the height at 47.14 (high) and 2.12 m (low), respectively, while based on crown widths were highest and lowest at 22.5 and 2.55 m, respectively. Results also indicate that the proposed algorithm of urban tree modelling is effective for practical use.

TI  - Compliance with clinical guidelines for breast cancer management: A population-based study of quality-of-care indicators in France
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA), which aims to standardize the quality of patient care in Europe, has defined quality indicators (QIs) for breast cancer (BC) care to assess compliance to current care standards. These QIs are a useful tool to evaluate care organizations. Only population-based studies are able to assess health system performance in "real-life" situations. This population-based study aimed to describe compliance with several EUSOMA QIs overall and according to patient and organizational factors in France.Methods1 560 adult women with primary invasive non-metastatic BC diagnosed in 2012 were randomly selected among all incident BC from 16 French geographical areas covered by cancer registries. Twelve EUSOMA QIs were selected regarding diagnosis, treatment and staging.ResultsThe minimum standard as proposed by EUSOMA was met for nine QIs related to pre-operative definitive diagnosis, multidisciplinary discussion and treatment (single surgery, breast conserving surgery (BCS) for small BC (< 3cm), radiotherapy after BCS or mastectomy for regional BC (pN >= 2a), hormonotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab). Low compliance was observed for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and staging imaging. Adherence to guidelines was usually lower in older patients and in patients with comorbidities. Multidisciplinary discussion was positively related to adherence to guidelines for diagnosis, staging practices (SNLB, imaging) and systemic treatments. Compliance also varied by area of residence and by place of first treatment.ConclusionThis study provides the first current, comprehensive overview of BC quality care at a population level in France. The guidelines were correctly applied in percentage satisfying the EUSOMA standards for the diagnosis and treatment of BC, although staging practices (SLNB, imaging) can be improved. These results highlight the need for continuous measurement of adherence to guidelines to improve BC care.

TI  - Phenomenology in five music education journals: Recent use and future directions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this comparative case study is to explore the recent use of phenomenological inquiries in music education articles published in five selected journals listed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science between 2012 and 2015. The five music education journals are The British Journal of Music Education, Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, International Journal of Music Education, Journal of Research in Music Education and Music Education Research. An interpretative philosophical worldview and a qualitative research design informed this research. By employing a constant comparative method and analysing 480 articles, the findings of this study revealed that phenomenological inquiry is the third most preferred strategy of inquiry by music education researchers. A heuristic model was developed as an interpretive tool to analyse the data. Although phenomenology is a strategy of inquiry that has a lot to offer music education, several concerns emerged over the quality and proper use as some studies evinced deficiencies regarding the clarity of the research design and disclosure of research procedures.

AB  - Rabbi Shaul Yisraeli (1909-1995) was one of religious Zionism's greatest rabbis and adjudicators. He served for many years as the rabbi of Moshav Kfar Haroeh, sat as a judge in the supreme Rabbinical Court and was head of the Merkaz Harav yeshiva. The purpose of this study is to shed light on Yisraeli's attitude towards work. Did he see work as a basic human obligation spelled out by the physical need for survival? Did he associate an ideological value with work, as part of a worldview integrating religious values with extra-religious ones, similar to socialism? Or did he see work as a religious value, one that stemmed from his theology?

TI  - Influence of multi-decadal land use, irrigation practices and climate on riparian corridors across the Upper Missouri River headwaters basin, Montana
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Missouri River headwaters (UMH) basin (36400 km(2)) depends on its river corridors to support irrigated agriculture and world-class trout fisheries. We evaluated trends (1984-2016) in riparian wetness, an indicator of the riparian condition, in peak irrigation months (June, July and August) for 158 km(2) of riparian area across the basin using the Landsat normalized difference wetness index (NDWI). We found that 8 of the 19 riparian reaches across the basin showed a significant drying trend over this period, including all three basin outlet reaches along the Jefferson, Madison and Gallatin rivers. The influence of upstream climate was quantified using per reach random forest regressions. Much of the interannual variability in the NDWI was explained by climate, especially by drought indices and annual precipitation, but the significant temporal drying trends persisted in the NDWI-climate model residuals, indicating that trends were not entirely attributable to climate. Over the same period we documented a basin-wide shift from 9% of agriculture irrigated with center-pivot irrigation to 50% irrigated with center-pivot irrigation. Riparian reaches with a drying trend had a greater increase in the total area with center-pivot irrigation (within reach and upstream from the reach) relative to riparian reaches without such a trend (p<0.05). The drying trend, however, did not extend to river discharge. Over the same period, stream gages (n = 7) showed a positive correlation with riparian wetness (p<0.05) but no trend in summer river discharge, suggesting that riparian areas may be more sensitive to changes in irrigation return flows relative to river discharge. Identifying trends in riparian vegetation is a critical precursor for enhancing the resiliency of river systems and associated riparian corridors.

TI  - Interrelations between surface, boundary layer, and columnar aerosol properties derived in summer and early autumn over a continental urban site in Warsaw, Poland
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - PollyXT Raman polarization lidar observations were performed at the Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSLab) in Warsaw (52.2109 degrees N, 20.9826 degrees E), Poland, in the framework of the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) and the Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS) projects. Data collected in July, August, and September of 2013, 2015, and 2016 were analysed using the classical Raman approach. In total, 246 sets of intact profiles, each set comprising particle extinction (alpha) and backscatter coefficients (beta) as well as linear particle depolarization ratios (delta) at 355 nm and 532 nm, were derived for statistical investigations and stored in the EARLINET/ACTRIS database. The main analysis was focused on intensive optical properties obtained within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Their interrelations were discussed for different periods: the entire day; night-time, with respect to the nocturnal boundary layer (NL) and the residual boundary layer (RL); at sunrise, with respect to the morning transition boundary layer (MTL); and from late afternoon until sunset, with respect to the well-mixed boundary layer (WML). Within the boundary layer, the lidar-derived optical properties (entire day, 246 sets) revealed a mean aerosol optical depth (AOD(ABL)) of 0.20 +/- 0.10 at 355 nm and 0.11 +/- 0.06 at 532 nm; a mean Angstrom exponent (AEABL) of 1.54 +/- 0.37; a mean lidar ratio (LRABL) of 48 +/- 17 sr at 355 nm and 41 +/- 15 sr at 532 nm; a mean linear particle depolarization ratio (delta(ABL)) of 0.02 +/- 0.01 at 355 nm and 0 :05 +/- 0 :01 at 532 nm; and a mean water vapour mixing ratio (WVABL) of 8.28 +/- 2.46 g kg(-1). In addition, the lidar-derived daytime boundary layer optical properties (for the MTL and WML) were compared with the corresponding daytime columnar aerosol properties derived from the multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFR-7) measuring within the National Aerosol Research Network (PolandAOD-NET) and the CE318 sun photometer of the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET). A high linear correlation of the columnar aerosol optical depth values from the two latter instruments was obtained in Warsaw (a correlation coefficient of 0.98 with a standard deviation of 0.02). The contribution of the aerosol load in the summer and earlyautumn free troposphere can result in an AODCL value that is twice as high as the AOD(ABL) over Warsaw. The occurrence of a turbulence-driven aerosol burst from the boundary layer into the free troposphere can further increase this difference. Aerosol within the ABL and in the free troposphere was interpreted based on comparisons of the properties derived at different altitudes with values reported in the literature, which were characteristic for different aerosol types, in combination with backward trajectory calculations, satellite data, and model outputs. Within the boundary layer, the aerosol consisted of either urban anthropogenic pollution (similar to 61 %) or mixtures of anthropogenic aerosol with biomassburning aerosol (< 14 %), local pollen (< 7 %), or Arctic marine particles (< 5 %). No significant contribution of mineral dust was found in the boundary layer. The lidar-derived atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) and the AOD(ABL) exhibited a positive correlation (R of 0.76), associated with the local anthropogenic pollution (most pronounced for the RL and WML).A positive correlation of the AODABL and LRABL and a negative correlation of the AE(ABL) and LRABL, as well as the expected negative trends for the WVABL (and surface relative humidity, RH) and delta(ABL), were observed. Relations of the lidar-derived aerosol properties within the ABL and the surface in situ measurements of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m (PM10) and less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) measured by the Warsaw Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection (WIOS) network, and the fine-to-coarse mass ratio (FCMR) were investigated. The FCMR and surface RH showed a positive correlation even at nighttime (R of 0.71 for the MTL, 0.63 for the WML, and 0.6 for the NL), which generally lacked statistically significant relations. A weak negative correlation of the FCMR and delta(ABL) (more pronounced at 532 nm at nighttime) and no casual relation between the FCMR and AE(ABL) were found. Most interestingly, distinct differences were observed for the morning transition layer (MTL) and the well-mixed layer (WML). The MTL ranged up to 0.6-1 km, and was characterized by a lower AOD(ABL)(< 0.12), wetter conditions (RH 50-80 %), smaller particles (AE(ABL) of 1-2.2; FCMR from 0.5 to 3), and a low LRABL of between 20 and 40 sr. The WMLranged up to 1-2.5 km and exhibited a higher AOD(ABL) (reaching up to 0.45), drier conditions (RH 25-60 %), larger particles (AE(ABL) of 0.8-1.7; FCMR of 0.2-1.5), and a higher LRABL of up to 90 sr.

TI  - The Difference in Light use Efficiency between an Abandoned Peatland Pasture and an Adjacent Boreal Bog in Western Newfoundland, Canada
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) is a critical parameter to estimate the gross primary production (GPP) for terrestrial ecosystems from remotely sensed data. Only a few studies have estimated the LUE for boreal peatlands and none has calculated the LUE for a drained boreal peatland due to the limited availability of direct measurement of GPP and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), which are required to calculate the LUE. In this study, we used eddy covariance (EC) measurement of GPP and APAR at a drained peatland pasture and an adjacent boreal bog to calculate the LUE. The pasture had a significantly higher LUE (0.034 +/- 0.0109 mol mol(-1)) than the bog (0.028 +/- 0.098 mol mol(-1)). The LUE showed significant year-to-year variation at the pasture, but not at the bog. The LUE variation strongly correlated with air temperature and water table depth at both sites, but did not correlate well with vapor pressure deficit. This study indicates that agricultural drainage significantly alters the LUE of boreal peatlands and that the drained peatlands need to be considered separately in LUE-based models for northern peatlands. Moreover, a longer period of study is needed to fully understand the temporal dynamics of LUE in natural peatlands.

TI  - A screening tool for acquired communication disorders in Aboriginal Australians after brain injury: lessons learned from the pilot phase
T2  - APHASIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Screening for communication disorders in a cross-cultural context presents numerous challenges, especially when the screening tool has been designed for use in one specific cultural and linguistic context. Translation enables it to be administered to speakers of a variety of languages, but does not account for the effects of worldview nor the linguistic and cultural context that motivated the original version. Clients assessed with tools not appropriate for their culture may be at a disadvantage in completing the assessment. Furthermore, this may influence diagnostic/screening judgements and decision-making related to access to relevant services. Aims: To describe the piloting of a screening tool developed to detect acquired communication disorders in Aboriginal Australians after stroke and traumatic brain injury ? the Aboriginal Communication Assessment After Brain Injury (ACAABI). The study aims to i) assess whether a non-speech pathologist (e.g., Aboriginal Health Practitioner) can easily and accurately administer the tool, ii) determine whether the tool can identify acquired communication disorders of any type, and iii) describe a series of practical challenges encountered. Methods and procedures: Aboriginal Research Assistants (ARAs) reflected the role of the Aboriginal Health Practitioner. ARAs administered the tool to 38 Aboriginal brain injury survivors across Western Australia. A Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) observed the assessments to evaluate test administration. Another SLP undertook an independent communication assessment to provide information to an expert panel who produced a consensus diagnosis with which to compare the tool results. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were undertaken in terms of the total score and individual section scores. Field notes captured challenges encountered. Outcomes and results: Aboriginal Research Assistants could administer the tool effectively for the majority of participants, with some variations occurring. The tool appeared to be sensitive to detection of acquired communication disorders but had a high false-positive rate. However, small sample size and lack of comparative groups of non-brain-damaged individuals and those without communication disorders limits interpretation at this time. Challenges included participant recruitment, scheduling of appointments across large geographical distances, and availability of Aboriginal Research Assistants. Conclusions: The ACAABI looks promising in its ability to provide a culturally appropriate and secure way to screen for acquired communication disorders in Aboriginal people after brain injury for the purpose of referring onwards for further investigation. However, numerous challenges were encountered in the piloting and further work is needed to adjust the tool, enabling reliability, sensitivity and specificity analyses to be conclusive.

TI  - biodivMapR: An r package for α- and β-diversity mapping using remotely sensed images
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accelerated erosion of biodiversity is a critical environmental challenge. Operational methods for the monitoring of biodiversity taking advantage of remotely sensed data are needed in order to provide information to ecologists and decision-makers. We present an R package designed to compute a selection of alpha- and beta-diversity indicators from optical imagery, based on spectral variation hypothesis. This package builds upon previous work on biodiversity mapping using airborne imaging spectroscopy, and has been adapted in order to process broader range of data sources, including Sentinel-2 satellite images. biodivMapR is able to produce alpha-diversity maps including Shannon and Simpson indices, as well as beta-diversity maps derived from Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. It is able to process large images efficiently with moderate computational requirements on a personal computer. Additional functions allow computing diversity indicators directly from field plots defined as polygon shapefiles for easy comparison with ground data and validation. The package biodivMapR should contribute to improved standards for biodiversity mapping using remotely sensed data. It should also contribute to the identification of relevant Remotely Sensed enabled Essential Biodiversity Variables.

TI  - Exploring vegetation indices adequate in detecting twister disease of onion using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional plant disease detection is time consuming and costly, thus an inexpensive and faster alternative method of detection is needed to send early warning to farmers to prevent pests and disease infestation and for proper intervention. To provide timely and accurate detection in twister disease of onion, remote sensing was exploited using Sentinel 2 imageries. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the VIS-NIR region of the image were evaluated for their capability to detect twister disease. VIs were subjected to regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices and severity index of onion twister disease. Vegetation indices with strong relationship to twister disease were selected and further used in unsupervised ISODATA classification. Overall accuracy of classification generated from vegetation indices were calculated based on confusion matrix using ground truth points collected from field work to identify the most suitable index based on highest overall accuracy. It was found out that NDVI and GNDVI has the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) indicating a strong relationship to the disease severity. Results of the classification shows that GNDVI, PSSRa and NDVI obtained the highest overall accuracy of 83.33%, 80.95% and 78.57% respectively. This indicates that these 3 VIs can be used for detection of twister disease in the field since it gives better discrimination and high accuracies. Hence, VI's generated from Sentinel 2 imagery has the potential in detection, monitoring and management of twister disease of onion in the field.

TI  - The Role and Necessity of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Invasive Melanoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a widely accepted procedure for melanoma staging and treatment. The development of lymphatic mapping and SLNB, which was first introduced in 1992, has enabled surgeons to detect microscopic nodal metastases and stage-negative regional nodal basins with low morbidity. SLNB has also facilitated the selective application of regional lymph node dissection for patients with microscopic nodal metastases, enabling unnecessary lymph node dissection. In contrast, recent major randomized phase III trials (DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II trial) compared the clinical benefit of early completion lymph node dissection with observation after detecting microscopic nodal disease. The results of those studies indicated that there was no significant difference in the survival between the two groups, although regional control was superior after early completion lymph node dissection compared to that obtained after observation. Thus, the role and value of early completion lymph node dissection worldwide are currently very limited for patients with microscopic nodal disease. However, the use of SLNB is still controversial. In addition, the recent approval of adjuvant therapy using novel agents, such as anti-programmed death-1 antibodies, and molecular targeted therapeutics may influence the skipping of complete lymph node dissection in patients with micrometastatic nodal disease in a real-world setting. Furthermore, modern neoadjuvant therapy, which is now under investigation, may have the potential to change the surgical procedure used for nodal disease. Herein, we describe the current role and value of SLNB and completion lymph node dissection and discuss the major controversies as well as the favorable future outlook.

AB  - Monitoring vegetation phenology is critical for quantifying climate change impacts on ecosystems. We present an extensive dataset of 1783 site-years of phenological data derived from PhenoCam network imagery from 393 digital cameras, situated from tropics to tundra across a wide range of plant functional types, biomes, and climates. Most cameras are located in North America. Every half hour, cameras upload images to the PhenoCam server. Images are displayed in near-real time and provisional data products, including timeseries of the Green Chromatic Coordinate (Gcc), are made publicly available through the project web page (https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/gallery/). Processing is conducted separately for each plant functional type in the camera field of view. The PhenoCam Dataset v2.0, described here, has been fully processed and curated, including outlier detection and expert inspection, to ensure high quality data. This dataset can be used to validate satellite data products, to evaluate predictions of land surface models, to interpret the seasonality of ecosystem-scale CO2 and H2O flux data, and to study climate change impacts on the terrestrial biosphere.

TI  - Evaluating remote sensing datasets and machine learning algorithms for mapping plantations and successional forests in Phnom Kulen National Park of Cambodia
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a modelling framework by utilizing multi-sensor imagery for classifying different forest and land use types in the Phnom Kulen National Park (PKNP) in Cambodia. Three remote sensing datasets (Landsat optical data, ALOS L-band data and LiDAR derived Canopy Height Model (CHM)) were used in conjunction with three different machine learning (ML) regression techniques (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)). These ML methods were implemented on (a) Landsat spectral data, (b) Landsat spectral band & ALOS backscatter data, and (c) Landsat spectral band, ALOS backscatter data, & LiDAR CHM data. The Landsat-ALOS combination produced more accurate classification results (95% overall accuracy with SVM) compared to Landsat-only bands for all ML models. Inclusion of LiDAR CHM (which is a proxy for vertical canopy heights) improved the overall accuracy to 98%. The research establishes that majority of PKNP is dominated by cashew plantations and the nearly intact forests are concentrated in the more inaccessible parts of the park. The findings demonstrate how different RS datasets can be used in conjunction with different ML models to map forests that had undergone varying levels of degradation and plantations.

TI  - The Prognosis and Natural History of In-Transit Melanoma Metastases at a High-Volume Centre
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with in-transit melanoma metastases (ITM) experience a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations and a highly variable disease course. There is no standardized treatment protocol for these patients due to the limited data comparing treatment modalities for ITM. This is the first study to describe the disease trajectory and natural history of a large cohort of patients with ITM. Methods A retrospective study of patients treated for ITM between 2004 and 2018 at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre was performed. Clinical and pathological characteristics for primary and in-transit episodes were analyzed for predictors of relapse-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and melanoma-specific survival. Results A total of 109 patients with 303 episodes of ITM were identified: 52 (48%) females, median age 70.1 years (range 35-92). The median RFS for all episodes was 5 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-5.7). Eighty-seven percent of episodes involving isolated in-transit lesions underwent surgical excision, compared with 17% involving more than five in-transit lesions. A trend was seen between a greater number of lesions and shorter RFS (p = 0.055). The median DMFS was 34.8 months (95% CI 22.8-51.6). Factors associated with shorter DMFS included primary tumor thickness (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15; p = 0.026), site of primary tumor (p = 0.008), and BRAF mutation (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.14-3.94; p = 0.018). Conclusions Locoregional relapse is common in patients with ITM regardless of treatment modality. Characteristics of the ITM may predict for RFS, while primary tumor characteristics remain important predictors of DMFS.

TI  - Multispectral canopy reflectance improves spatial distribution models of Amazonian understory species
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution models are required for the research and management of biodiversity in the hyperdiverse tropical forests, but reliable and ecologically relevant digital environmental data layers are not always available. We here assess the usefulness of multispectral canopy reflectance (Landsat) relative to climate data in modelling understory plant species distributions in tropical rainforests. We used a large dataset of quantitative fern and lycophyte species inventories across lowland Amazonia as the basis for species distribution modelling (SDM). As predictors, we used CHELSA climatic variables and canopy reflectance values from a recent basin-wide composite of Landsat TM/ETM+ images both separately and in combination. We also investigated how species accumulate over sites when environmental distances were expressed in terms of climatic or surface reflectance variables. When species accumulation curves were constructed such that differences in Landsat reflectance among the selected plots were maximised, species accumulated faster than when climatic differences were maximised or plots were selected in a random order. Sixty-nine species were sufficiently frequent for species distribution modelling. For most of them, adequate SDMs were obtained whether the models were based on CHELSA data only, Landsat data only or both combined. Model performance was not influenced by species' prevalence or abundance. Adding Landsat-based environmental data layers overall improved the discriminatory capacity of SDMs compared to climate-only models, especially for soil specialist species. Our results show that canopy surface reflectance obtained by multispectral sensors can provide studies of tropical ecology, as exemplified by SDMs, much higher thematic (taxonomic) detail than is generally assumed. Furthermore, multispectral datasets complement the traditionally used climatic layers in analyses requiring information on environmental site conditions. We demonstrate the utility of freely available, global remote sensing data for biogeographical studies that can aid conservation planning and biodiversity management.

TI  - A nonparametric fuzzy shoreline extraction approach from Sentinel-1A by integration of RASAT pan-sharpened imagery
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are among the most important features of the earth as they have social and economic importance for the environment. Thus, they should be frequently monitored for management issues, for example, shoreline erosion, and any essential precautions for safe management taken. Shoreline extraction is an important tool to determine coastal changes. Modern technologies such as remote sensing give an opportunity to gain up-to-date, accurate, and reliable information with fast data acquisition for coastal regions. In this study, two different coastal areas, one in the northern part of Turkey (Terkos/Istanbul) and the second from the southern part of the country (Kemer/Antalya), were studied. The main objective of this study is to extract shorelines from Sentinel-1A radio detection and ranging satellite data using a non-parametric fuzzy approach, by exploiting Turkish multispectral RASAT satellite images. For this purpose, a whale optimization algorithm was initially employed to create land and water classes from RASAT images. The created classes were used as inputs to determine fuzzy membership values for non-parametric shoreline extractions from Sentinel-1A images. The results are evaluated in comparison with manually digitized reference shorelines by calculating the perpendicular distances between the digitized and remotely sensed shorelines. The calculated average distances from the RASAT-integrated Sentinel-1A (RASAT + Sentinel-1A) for Terkos/Istanbul and Kemer/Antalya were 29.18 m and 16.78 m, respectively. Average differences were also calculated using only RASAT images as 13.37 m and 6.29 m for both areas, respectively.

T2  - AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ghana, studies on urban sprawl have focused on the use of conventional survey maps and qualitative descriptions that mask policy-relevant information for planning. We apply remote sensing data and spatial statistics to examine the Spatio-temporal dynamics in the internal structure of two cities. We find that the total area of the urban fabric in Wa increased from 11.365ha ? 0.413ha in 1986 to 1, 775.848ha ? 52.094ha in 2017, while Tamale?s increased from 715.425ha ? 5.969ha in 1984 to 6,890.177ha ? 208.105ha in 2017. The results also revealed contiguity in urban clusters. We discuss the implications of our findings within the context of spatial planning in Ghana.

TI  - A Near-Real-Time Version of the Cross-Calibrated Multiplatform (CCMP) Ocean Surface Wind Velocity Data Set
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cross-Calibrated Multiplatform (CCMP) ocean surface wind data set was originally developed by Atlas and coworkers to blend cross-calibrated satellite winds, in situ data, and wind analyses from numerical weather prediction. CCMP uses a variational analysis method to smoothly blend these data sources into a gap-free gridded wind estimate every 6 hr. CCMP version 2.0 is currently produced by Remote Sensing Systems using consistently cross-calibrated satellite winds, in situ data from moored buoys, and background winds from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The reanalysis fields are only available after a delay of several months, making it impossible to produce CCMP 2.0 in near real time. Measurements from in situ sources such as moored buoys are also often delayed. To overcome these obstacles and produce a near-real-time (NRT) version of CCMP (CCMP-NRT), two changes are made to the input data sets: The background winds are now the operational 0.25-degree NCEP analysis winds, and no in situ data are used. This allows CCMP-NRT to be routinely processed with a latency of less than 48 hr. An intercomparison of the CCMP-NRT results with CCMP 2.0, and independent measurements from moored buoys shows that CCMP-NRT provides a modest improvement over the background wind from NCEP in regions where satellite data are available. Analysis shows that the inclusion of in situ measurement in CCMP improves the agreement with these measurements, artificially reducing estimates of the error.Plain Language Summary Satellites that orbit the Earth estimate winds over the ocean by evaluating the roughness the ocean surface. These satellites make their measurements at different time of the day, and there are spatial gaps between the satellite measurements. These characteristics make the data hard to use. The Cross-Calibrated Multiplatform (CCMP) vector wind analysis uses a mathematical technique that combines satellite measurements, in situ measurements, and a background wind field into complete maps of ocean winds every 6 hr. This paper describes a new version of CCMP that can be constructed only a few days after the satellite measurement are made, opening up near-real-time applications for these data.

TI  - Air-sea fluxes of greenhouse gases and oxygen in the northern Benguela Current region during upwelling events
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based atmospheric observations of CO2, delta(O-2/N-2), N2O, and CH4 were used to make estimates of the air-sea fluxes of these species from the Luderitz and Walvis Bay upwelling cells in the northern Benguela region, during upwelling events. Average flux densities (+/- 1 sigma) were 0:65 +/- 0:4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for CO2, -5.1 +/- 2:5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for O-2 (as APO), 0:61 +/- 0:5 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for N2O, and 4:8 +/- 6:3 nmol m(-2)s(-1) for CH4. A comparison of our top-down (i.e., inferred from atmospheric anomalies) flux estimates with shipboard-based measurements showed that the two approaches agreed within +/- 55% on average, though the degree of agreement varied by species and was best for CO2. Since the top-down method overestimated the flux density relative to the shipboard-based approach for all species, we also present flux density estimates that have been tuned to best match the shipboard fluxes. During the study, upwelling events were sources of CO2, N2O, and CH4 to the atmosphere. N2O fluxes were fairly low, in accordance with previous work suggesting that the evasion of this gas from the Benguela is smaller than for other eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS). Conversely, CH4 release was quite high for the marine environment, a result that supports studies that indicated a large sedimentary source of CH4 in the Walvis Bay area. These results demonstrate the suitability of atmospheric time series for characterizing the temporal variability of upwelling events and their influence on the overall marine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the northern Benguela region.

TI  - Comparing Support Vector Machines and Maximum Likelihood Classifiers for Mapping of Urbanization
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of environmental processes and properties using Landsat imagery has evolved since its inception in 1972. Monitoring of land cover and its changes over space and time using classification algorithms is one of the most important uses of remote sensing. However, the reliability of the land cover products from remotely sensed data is dependent upon the accuracy of different classification parameters. In this study, we have applied and tested two land cover classification algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood (ML) for land cover classification of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, between 1988 and 2016. The results show that SVM has better classification accuracies compared to ML.

TI  - Application of Landsat derived indices and hydrological alteration matrices to quantify the response of floodplain wetlands to river hydrology in arid regions based on different dam operation strategies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of floodplain wetlands to changes in river hydrology caused by different dam operation strategies in arid regions has attracted worldwide attention in recent decades. However, less is known about quantifying the effects of dam operations on wetlands in different lateral zones located in low-gradient floodplains in arid regions using remote sensing and hydrological time series. In this study, hydrological time series from 1975 to 1985 and 2008-2014 were used to quantify 67 flow metrics during different dam operation periods. Time series of remote sensing data (39 periods in total) from 1975 to 1977 and 2008-2014 were analysed to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics in floodplain wetland types (river, bare wet land and wetland vegetation areas). In addition, a correlation analysis was performed to quantify the relationship between each wetland type and the flow metrics in different lateral zones. The results indicate that approximately 90% of the water and bare wet land area were located in the continuously and frequently inundated zones. Vegetation was the main wetland type in the regularly and extremely rarely inundated zones, and a 45.7% decrease in the vegetation area of these two belts occurred; in contrast, a 20.14 km(2) of increase in vegetation occurred in the frequently inundated zone after the uniform scheduling was implemented for the entire river. Linear correlation and regression analysis showed that the different dam operation strategies resulted in various wetland changes in the different lateral zones. The decrease in high flows and increase in low flows caused a decrease in the vegetation cover area in the regularly and extremely rarely inundated zones and led to vegetation encroachment in the frequently inundated zone. Our study can improve the management of wetlands and water resources in arid region floodplains. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determining the best remotely sensed DEM for flood inundation mapping in data sparse regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most essential inputs in flood inundation mapping is the geometric description of the floodplains and river channel that often derives from the digital elevation models (DEMs). By increasing the satellite-based technologies during the past 30 years, several DEM sources ranging from fine-resolution and accurate, but costly, to low-cost and low-resolution have been developed. In most parts of the world, especially developing countries and data sparse regions, the coarse resolution DEMs is the only available data set for hydraulic modelling and flood inundation mapping. This research addressed the usefulness and efficiency of the recently released Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) DEM in flood inundation mapping using 1D Hydrologic Engineering Centre- River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. In addition, other DEM sources such as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM-90 m), SRTM-30 m, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER-30 m) are used to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of remotely sensed DEMs for flood inundation mapping. Findings indicate that using ALOS-30m for hydraulic simulation approximately leads to the similar results as well as ground-based DEM (GDEM). For example, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in simulating mean Water Surface Elevation (WSE) and mean inundated extents based on this dataset, within the cross-sections, is lower than 8% and 13% for SojasRood river, respectively, while for Sarbaz river these values are 9% and 2%. Moreover, in both rivers, SRTM-30 m relative to ASTER-30 m and SRTM-90 m DEMs presents better results in deriving the geometric model and hydraulic simulation. Also, Hydraulic modelling based on ASTER-30 m, even relative to SRTM-90 m as a coarser resolution DEM, shows a significant discrepancy compared to GDEM. Moreover, in both rivers, the MAPE in predicting inundated extents, within the reaches, is higher than 38%.

TI  - Ground ozone variations at an urban and a rural station in Beijing from 2006 to 2017: Trend, meteorological influences and formation regimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to complicated ozone formation regimes controlled by both ozone precursors and meteorological conditions, the underlying drivers for soaring ozone concentrations in Beijing were limitedly examined. With ground observation and remotely sensed data, the variation of ground ozone concentrations at an urban AT (Aoti) station and a rural YF (Yufa) station in Beijing was examined and a notable upward trend of ozone concentrations at both stations was found from 2006 to 2017. Following this, through a statistical model, the relative contribution of meteorological conditions to long-term ozone variations at both stations was calculated as 2%-3%, indicating anthropogenic emissions were the major cause for long-term ozone variations in Beijing. Meanwhile, short-term ozone variations could be influenced significantly by seasonal and synoptic meteorological conditions. Furthermore, the long-term variations of ozone formation regimes across Beijing were analyzed using OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) retrieved HCHO VCDs (Vertical Column Densities)/NO2 VCDs, which were strongly correlated with ozone concentrations. The results suggested that the ozone formation regime for the AT urban station and YF rural station had changed from VOCs-limited and NOx-limited to VOCs-NOx-limited respectively. In this case, NOx-oriented emission-reduction measures for reducing PM2.5 concentrations might conversely enhance ozone concentrations in Beijing. Given the increasingly heterogeneous distribution of different ozone formation regimes across Beijing, emission-reduction strategies that balanced consider the reduction of VOCs and NOx emissions should be better designed and implemented according to local ozone formation regimes.

TI  - Climate change leads to a doubling of turbidity in a rapidly expanding Tibetan lake
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent climate change is causing most lakes on the Tibetan Plateau to grow at an unprecedented rate. Changes in the physical properties and water storage of the lakes are now relatively well documented. Yet the impacts on their water quality remain poorly understood. Turbidity is a well-established optical water-quality indicator related to suspended particulate matter concentration which can affect vertical light attenuation and ecosystem functioning. Here, we use remotely sensed data to assess the seasonal and long-term variations in turbidity in Siting Lake, one of the fastest growing lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, and to identify potential driving mechanisms of this change. The lake experiences two distinct peaks of turbidity during the year: one in August (warm season) caused by the seasonal influx of sediments from the Zagya Zangbo River, and one in December (cold season) caused by the wind-driven resuspension of sediments along the lakes' shorelines. The analysis further revealed a persistent increasing trend that doubled the average lake turbidity between 2000 and 2017. Evidence suggests this rise in turbidity results from a climate-driven increase in sediment supply from the Zagya Zangbo River, and from sediment resuspension associated with the erosion of shorelines recently submerged during the rapid expansion of the lake (paleoshorelines).

TI  - Modeling Biophysical Variables and Land Surface Temperature Using the GWR Model: Case Study-Tehran and Its Satellite Cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-cover type plays a decisive role for the land surface temperature (LST). Since cities and their satellite cities are composed of varying covers, including vegetation, built-up areas, buildings, roads, and bare areas, the main purpose of this research is to examine the LST in Tehran and its satellite cities and the cover type that contributes to increased or decreased temperature. The study investigated the relationship between NDVI, SAVI, NDBI, and NDBaI indices, as four biophysical variables, and LST over a period of 15 years (2001-2015) by the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model using imagery of Landsat 7. The results showed that the relationship between LST and NDBI is stronger than the associations with other variables. In 2010, biophysical variables had the greatest effect on LST. Using the GWR model, the local R2map was drawn for the studied area, showing that the highest value for the coefficient of determination belonged to Islamshahr and Shahriar because of the homogeneity of the land cover in these cities.

TI  - Physically constrained spatiotemporal modeling: generating clear-sky constructions of land surface temperature from sparse, remotely sensed satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote-sensing is used to collect important atmospheric and geophysical data at various spatial resolutions, providing insight into spatiotemporal surface and climate variability globally. These observations are often plagued with missing spatial and temporal information of Earth's surface due to (1) cloud cover at the time of a satellite passing and (2) infrequent passing of polar-orbiting satellites. While many methods are available to model missing data in space and time, in the case of land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared remote sensing, these approaches generally ignore the temporal pattern called the ?diurnal cycle? which physically constrains temperatures to peak in the early afternoon and reach a minimum at sunrise. In order to infill an LST dataset, we parameterize the diurnal cycle into a functional form with unknown spatiotemporal parameters. Using multiresolution spatial basis functions, we estimate these parameters from sparse satellite observations to reconstruct an LST field with continuous spatial and temporal distributions. These estimations may then be used to better inform scientists of spatiotemporal thermal patterns over relatively complex domains. The methodology is demonstrated using data collected by MODIS on NASA's Aqua and Terra satellites over both Houston, TX and Phoenix, AZ USA.

TI  - Floral abundance and richness drive beneficial arthropod conservation and biological control on golf courses
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use, which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the biological control services of flying natural enemies and few investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of turfgrass pests.

TI  - Assessment of Landsat 5 Images Atmospherically Corrected with LEDAPS in Water Quality Time Series
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work is to assess and use Landsat TM5 for the inventory and study of the evolution of water quality in gravel pit ponds within the natural park, Parque Regional del Sureste (PRSE), from 1984 to 2011. First, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) was applied to 230 Landsat TM5 images to distinguish water and non-water information. Next, the surface reflectance derived from Landsat TM5 images atmospherically corrected with the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) was compared to water-leaving reflectance measured in the field, showing a significant overestimation of surface reflectance derived from Landsat data. Thus, a new regression equation was proposed linking the in situ Secchi depth (SD) measurements to surface reflectance measured by Landsat 5. This regression was validated and subsequently applied to every image, providing an SD value for each pixel in the time series. Finally, the retrieved SD values were used to compute the trophic state of water bodies according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) classification. The results show an increase in the surface area of water bodies in the PRSE from 1984 to 2006, as well as an improvement in their water quality.

TI  - How International Are the Top International Journals of Criminology and Criminal Justice?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of international, non-Anglo-American involvement in the editorial boards and content of the leading international journals of criminology and criminal law to investigate a reported bias against non-Anglo-American material. The research employed editorial board and content analysis of ten leading journals of criminology and criminal law, selected because of their international involvement according to their own aims and scope's description. Most of the ten journals were found to have low levels of international involvement, with high proportions of both Anglo-American authors and data, and Anglo-American membership of editorial boards. The editorial board analysis also revealed institutional links with journal boards and a network of overlapping membership between the editorial boards. This suggests the existence of networks of Anglo-American scholars who are naturally inclined to favour research that fits their worldview. Such networks create a hierarchy of knowledge that favours the one produced in the US and the UK and promotes the scientific success of Anglo-American scholars and contents. However, although the shadow of Anglo-American dominance continues to lie over the two fields, there is also evidence of increasing research and authorship diversity. Perhaps, we are entering a new era of research internationalism.

TI  - Value of Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to define the role of preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for nodal metastasis detection in Endometrial Cancer (EC) patients. From January 2014 to August 2016 patients affected by EC scheduled for surgery underwent PET/CT scan and SLN mapping with indocyanine-green. Patients with suspicious lymph nodes at FDG-PET/CT underwent selective pelvic lymphadenectomy. In case of undetectable SLN, no further lymphadenectomy was performed if PET/CT scan was negative. Basic descriptive statistics were used to describe outcomes. A total of 83 patients were enrolled in the study. PET/CT scan was suggestive of nodal involvement in 15 patients. SLN were detected bilaterally in 78% of patients. Detection rate was influenced by patients' BMI and surgical learning curve. Five patients were node-positive: all of these had hypermetabolic nodes on PET/CT scan; in one patient SLN was not detected. Ten out of 15 patients with suspicious nodes on PET/CT scan were node-negative. After a median follow up of 24 months all patients are alive. Four patients experienced recurrent disease. No nodal relapse was recorded. Lymphatic mapping with sentinel node biopsy is able to reduce morbidity associated with pelvic lymphadenectomy. Sentinel node assessment is a feasible and appealing procedure and should be performed in a specialized center. Detection rate strongly improves with learning curve, while is reduced in morbidly obese patients. PET/CT scan shows high sensitivity but moderate specificity for nodal metastasis and may help to avoid nodal dissection in patients with sentinel node mapping failure.

TI  - Estimating the Pollution Level Based on Heavy Metal Concentration in Water Bodies of Tiruppur District
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in toxic metal concentration leads to environmental pollution. The pollution level can be estimated by measuring the concentration of these heavy metals. This work was conducted to determine the level of heavy metal contamination in the water bodies due to the activities of industries. This paper discusses the concentrations of few heavy metals which were measured in Tiruppur District, Tamil Nadu, India, known for dyeing activities. The heavy metal concentrations have been investigated using water samples and remote sensing data (Cartosat-2) with the relevant water standards. Recursive linear regression analysis is applied for estimating the concentration from remote sensing data. Based on these estimated concentrations of the pollution level, mapping was done using clustering and band-max mechanism. Finally, the heavy metal concentration estimated from remote sensing data was correlated with in situ heavy metal concentration data and results are analyzed.

TI  - Vegetation greening in Spain detected from long term data (1981?2015)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a newly developed high-resolution (1.1 km) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index dataset for the peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands (Sp_1km_NDVI). This dataset is developed based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA?AVHRR) afternoon images, spanning the past three decades (1981?2015). After a careful pre-processing procedure, including calibration with post-launch calibration coefficients, geometric and topographic corrections, cloud removal, temporal filtering, and bi-weekly composites by maximum NDVI-value, we assessed changes in vegetation greening over the study domain using Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen statistics. Our trend results were compared with those derived from some widely recognized global NDVI datasets [e.g. the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies 3rd generation (GIMMS3g), Smoothed NDVI (SMN) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. Results demonstrate that there is a good agreement between the annual trends based on Sp_1km_NDVI product and other datasets. Nonetheless, we found some differences in the spatial patterns of the NDVI trends at the seasonal scale. Overall, in comparison to the available global NDVI datasets, Sp_1km_NDVI allows for characterizing changes in vegetation greening at a more-detailed spatial and temporal scale. In specific, our dataset provides relatively long-term corrected satellite time series (>30 years), which are crucial to understand the response of vegetation to climate change and human-induced activities. Also, given the complex spatial structure of NDVI changes over the study domain, particularly due to the rapid land intensification processes, the spatial resolution (1.1 km) of our dataset can provide detailed spatial information on the inter-annual variability of vegetation greening in this Mediterranean region and assess its links to climate change and variability.

TI  - Sulfur dioxide layer height retrieval from Sentinel-5 Precursor/TROPOMI using FP_ILM
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate determination of the location, height, and loading of sulfur dioxide (SO2) plumes emitted by volcanic eruptions is essential for aviation safety. The SO2 layer height is also one of the most critical parameters with respect to determining the impact on the climate. Retrievals of SO2 plume height have been carried out using satellite UV backscatter measurements, but, until now, such algorithms are very time-consuming. We have developed an extremely fast yet accurate SO2 layer height retrieval using the Full-Physics Inverse Learning Machine (FP_ILM) algorithm. This is the first time the algorithm has been applied to measurements from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor platform. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of the FP_ILM algorithm to retrieve SO2 plume layer heights in near-real-time applications with an accuracy of better than 2 km for SO2 total columns larger than 20 DU. We present SO2 layer height results for the volcanic eruptions of Sinabung in February 2018, Sierra Negra in June 2018, and Raikoke in June 2019, observed by TROPOMI.

TI  - Extensive vegetation browning and drying in forests of India's Tiger Reserves
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation includes stemming deforestation as well as preserving its vegetation condition. Traditional Protected Area (PA) effectiveness evaluations have assessed changes in forest extent but have mostly ignored vegetation condition. Tiger Reserves (TRs) are India's PAs with highest protection and management resources. We used a before-after-control-impact-style design with long-term Landsat 5 TM data to evaluate the effects of protection elevation on vegetation condition (greenness and moisture) in 25 TRs. After declaration as TRs, vegetation condition in 13 TRs (52%) declined in more than 50% of their areas, with 12 TRs (48%) being overall better than their matched Wildlife Sanctuaries (WLSs; PAs with lower protection). In 8 of these TRs analysed for change from before to after declaration, vegetation condition in 5 TRs was harmed over more than 25% of their areas, with 3 TRs being overall better than their matched WLSs. Our results indicate extensive vegetation browning and drying in about half of the study TRs, with these trends often being similar or worse than in matched WLSs. These results suggest that TRs' elevated protection alone may be insufficient to preserve vegetation condition and cast doubt on the effectiveness of protection elevation alone in safeguarding long-term viability of tiger habitats.

TI  - The History of Enterovirus A71 Outbreaks and Molecular Epidemiology in the Asia-Pacific Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the common causative pathogens for hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) affecting young children. HFMD outbreak can result in a substantial pediatric hospitalization and burden the healthcare services, especially in less-developed countries. Since the initial epidemic of predominantly EV-A71 in California in 1969, the high prevalence of HFMD in the Asia-pacific region and elsewhere around the world represents a significant morbidity in this age group. With the advent of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of laboratory-confirmed EV-A71 infection over the past two decades. The population, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity among countries in the Asia-Pacific region all influence the transmission and morbidity associated with HFMD. This review summarizes the current state of epidemiology of EV-A71 in Asia-Pacific countries based on the most recent epidemiological data and available information on the prevalence and disease burden. This knowledge is important in guiding the prevention, control and future research on vaccine development of this highly contagious disease of significant socioeconomic implications in public health.

TI  - Using satellite-measured relative humidity for prediction of <i>Metisa plana</i>'s population in oil palm plantations: A comparative assessment of regression and artificial neural network models
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Metisa plana (Walker) is a leaf defoliating pest that is able to cause staggering economical losses to oil palm cultivation. Considering the economic devastation that the pest could bring, an early warning system to predict its outbreak is crucial. The state of art of satellite technologies are now able to derive environmental factors such as relative humidity (RH) that may influence pest population's fluctuations in rapid, harmless, and cost-effective manners. This study examined the relationship between the presence of Metisa plana at different time lags and remote sensing (RS) derived RH by using statistical and machine learning approaches. Metisa plana census data of cumulated larvae instar 1, 2, 3, and 4 were collected biweekly in 2014 and 2015 in an oil palm plantation in Muadzam Shah, Pahang, Malaysia. Relative humidity values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images were apportioned to 6 time lags; 1 week (T1), 2 weeks (T2), 3 week (T3), 4 weeks (T4), 5 week (T5) and 6 weeks (T6) and paired with the respective census data. Pearson's correlation was carried out to analyse the relationship between Metisa plana and RH at different time lags. Regression analyses and artificial neural network (ANN) were also conducted to develop the best prediction model of Metisa plana's outbreak. The results showed relatively high correlations, positively or negatively, between the presences of Metisa plana with RH ranging from 0.46 to 0.99. ANN was found to be superior to regression models with the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) between the actual and predicted Metisa plana values ranging from 0.06 to 0.57 versus 0.00 to 0.05. The analysis on the best time lags illustrated that the multiple time lags were more influential on the Metisa plana population than the individual time lags. The best Metisa plana prediction model was derived from T1, T2 and T3 multiple time lags modelled using the ANN algorithm with R-2 value of 0.57, errors below 1.14 and accuracies above 93%. Based on the result of this study, the elucidation of Metisa plana's landscape ecology was possible with the utilization of RH as the predictor variable in consideration of the time lag effects of RH on the pest's population.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops monitoring is a challengeable subject that radar images can help it. The applicability of Sentinel-1 SAR data with dual polarization provided a splendid opportunity to develop a method for estimating rice parameters. Heights of cereal and biomass are two significant characteristics of rice that can be estimated with assessing satellite data and field measurements by classical regression methods [multiple linear regression (MLR), relevance vector regression (RVR), and support vector regression (SVR)]. In this study, Sentinel-1 SAR data from April 2018 to September 2018 in Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh region in the north of Iran were used. To evaluate and analyze validation of regression methods, field measurements (gathered from 15 plots) were utilized. The efficiency of nonparametric methods (SVR and RVR) is much better than that of the parametric regression (MLR) for rice parameter estimations. Among nonparametric approaches, RVR method has better results than SVR, because of the highest correlation coefficient (R-2) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE). R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 162.1, and MAE = 971.9 and R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 10.9, and MAE = 70.71 are the results of height and biomass, respectively.

TI  - Higher temporal evapotranspiration estimation with improved SEBS model from geostationary meteorological satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable in hydrologic cycle that directly affects the redistribution of precipitation and surface balance. ET measurements with high temporal resolution are required for coupling with models of highly dynamic processes, e.g., hydrological and land surface processes. The Haihe River Basin is the focus of China's industrial base and it is one of the three major grain-producing regions within the country. However, this area is facing serious water resource shortages and water pollution problems. The present study used geostationary satellite remote sensing data, in situ meteorological observations, and the surface energy balance system (SEBS) model with a new kB(-1) parameterization to estimate 3-hourly and daily energy and water fluxes in the Haihe River Basin. The results of the SEBS model were validated with point-scale data from five observation flux towers. Validation showed that 3-hourly and daily ET derived from the SEBS model performed well (R-2 = 0.67, mean bias = 0.027 mm/h, RMSE = 0.1 mm/h). Moreover, factors influencing ET were also identified based on the results of this study. ET varies with land cover type and physical and chemical properties of the underlying surface. Furthermore, ET is also controlled by water availability, radiation, and other atmospheric conditions. It was found that ET had strong correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Specifically, daily ET fluctuated with the NDVI when the NDVI was <0.29, and ET increased rapidly as the NDVI increased from 0.29 to 0.81. For NDVI values >0.81, indicating a state of saturation, the rate of increase of ET slowed. This research produced reliable information that could assist in sustainable management of the water resources and in improved understanding of the hydrologic cycle of the Haihe River Basin.

TI  - Pupils and worldview expression in an integrative classroom context
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore pupil perspectives on religions and worldviews in a mutual integrative space of religious and worldview education in a Finnish context. Analysing group interview data (N = 38) gathered from lower secondary school pupils attending mutual classes of religious and worldview education, the article explores how religious and non-religious worldviews can be explored in order to enhance subjectification in worldview education. The findings indicate that for pupils, the heterogeneity and lived dimensions reflected in personal worldviews, and questions relating to meaning, emotion and individuality in worldviews, are at the forefront in learning from religions and worldviews. The experiences of the pupils indicate that the concepts employed in religious and worldview education concerning religions and worldview phenomena should be examined critically in the light of the personal meaning making level of the pupils themselves.

TI  - The Plague of Bannonism
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Donald Trump?s thinking is too erratic and scattershot to count as a real system of ideas. Steve Bannon?s version of populism seems significantly more focused, more self-conscious, and hence more open to theory-based critical analysis, which this paper attempts to provide. That is not at all to say, however, that Bannon?s ideas achieve intellectual coherence or consistency. Close examination of the defining components of his worldview suggest the opposite. Still, engagement with contemporary right-populism cannot, or should not, avoid Bannon and his attempts to cook up a new ideology.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: An Evolving Paradigm Shift
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a high rate of recurrence and lethality. In addition, less than half of all patients are able to complete systemic therapy after curative-intent pancreatectomy. With its well-known potential benefits, this report highlights the current prospective data relevant to the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy in resectable PDAC. Recently, there have been numerous reports, many of which consist of long-awaited multi-intuitional trial data evaluating the use of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy in non-metastatic PDAC as well as the use of combination chemotherapy regimens in the adjuvant setting. Currently, recommended guidelines for neoadjuvant systemic therapy only exist for borderline-resectable and locally-advanced disease. Given the plethora of new data, there has been a shift in the paradigm of how resectable pancreatic cancer is treated at certain centers across the world. This review highlights the relevant available data from recent sentinel prospective trials and how they relate to the systemic treatment of resectable PDAC in the neoadjuvant setting.

TI  - Tracking down global NH<sub>3</sub> point sources with wind-adjusted superresolution
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a precursor of atmospheric aerosols, ammonia (NH3) is one of the primary gaseous air pollutants. Given its short atmospheric lifetime, ambient NH3 concentrations are dominated by local sources. In a recent study, Van Damme et al. (2018) have highlighted the importance of NH3 point sources, especially those associated with feedlots and industrial ammonia production. Their emissions were shown to be largely underestimated in bottom-up emission inventories. The discovery was made possible thanks to the use of over-sampling techniques applied to 9 years of global daily IASI NH3 satellite measurements. Oversampling allows one to increase the spatial resolution of averaged satellite data beyond what the satellites natively offer. Here we apply for the first time superresolution techniques, which are commonplace in many fields that rely on imaging, to measurements of an atmospheric sounder, whose images consist of just single pixels. We demonstrate the principle on synthetic data and on IASI measurements of a surface parameter. Superresolution is a priori less suitable to be applied on measurements of variable atmospheric constituents, in particular those affected by transport. However, by first applying the wind-rotation technique, which was introduced in the study of other primary pollutants, superresolution becomes highly effective in mapping NH3 at a very high spatial resolution. We show that plume transport can be revealed in greater detail than what was previously thought to be possible. Next, using this wind-adjusted superresolution technique, we introduce a new type of NH3 map that allows tracking down point sources more easily than the regular oversampled average. On a subset of known emitters, the source could be located within a median distance of 1.5 km. We subsequently present a new global point-source catalog consisting of more than 500 localized and categorized point sources. Compared to our previous catalog, the number of identified sources more than doubled. In addition, we refined the classification of industries into five categories - fertilizer, coking, soda ash, geothermal and explosives industries - and introduced a new urban category for isolated NH3 hotspots over cities. The latter mainly consists of African megacities, as clear isolation of such urban hotspots is almost never possible elsewhere due to the presence of a diffuse background with higher concentrations. The techniques presented in this paper can most likely be exploited in the study of point sources of other short-lived atmospheric pollutants such as SO2 and NO2.

TI  - Assessment of Various Fuzzy <i>c</i>-Mean Clustering Validation Indices for Mapping Mineral Prospectivity: Combination of Multifractal Geochemical Model and Mineralization Processes
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the application of an unsupervised clustering method, fuzzy c-means (FCM), to generate mineral prospectivity models for Cu +/- Au +/- Fe mineralization in the Feizabad District of NE Iran. Various evidence layers relevant to indicators or potential controls on mineralization, including geochemical data, geological-structural maps and remote sensing data, were used. The FCM clustering approach was employed to reduce the dimensions of nine key attribute vectors derived from different exploration criteria. Multifractal inverse distance weighting interpolation coupled with factor analysis was used to generate enhanced multi-element geochemical signatures of areas with Cu +/- Au +/- Fe mineralization. The GIS-based fuzzy membership function MSLarge was used to transform values of the different evidence layers, including geological-structural controls as well as alteration, into a [0-1] range. Four FCM-based validation indices, including Bezdek's partition coefficient (V-Pc) and partition entropy (V-Pe) indices, the Fukuyama and Sugeno (V-FS) index and the Xie and Beni (V-XB) index, were employed to derive the optimum number of clusters and subsequently generate prospectivity maps. Normalized density indices were applied for quantitative evaluation of the classes of the FCM prospectivity maps. The quantitative evaluation of the results demonstrates that the higher favorability classes derived from V-FS and V-XB (N-d=9.19) appear more reliable than those derived from V-Pc and V-Pe (N-d=6.12) in detecting existing mineral deposits and defining new zones of potential Cu +/- Au +/- Fe mineralization in the study area.

TI  - Intra-nodal nevi in sentinel node-negative patients with cutaneous melanoma does not influence survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Melanoma patients with intra-nodal nevi (INN) and without melanoma metastasis in the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are generally treated as patients with negative SLNB. However, diagnosis of INN may be difficult and nodal melanoma metastases may falsely be regarded as INN. Objectives Our aim was to evaluate the clinical significance of INN in the SLNB in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma on a nationwide level in The Netherlands by comparing survival between three groups: patients with INN and without nodal melanoma metastasis (INN group), patients without INN and without nodal melanoma metastasis (negative SLNB group) and patients with nodal melanoma metastasis irrespective of INN (positive SLNB group). Methods Data were obtained from 'PALGA', the Dutch Nationwide Network and Registry of Histopathology and Cytopathology, yielding a cohort of adults with histologically proven, primary, invasive cutaneous melanoma patients in The Netherlands diagnosed between 2000 and 2014 who underwent SLNB. Clinical and pathological variables were extracted from the pathology text files. Differences between patients with INN, negative SLNB and positive SLNB were analysed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results A total of 11 274 patients were eligible for inclusion. The prevalence of INN in the SLNB was 5.0%. Melanomas with INN had similar median Breslow thickness compared to melanomas with negative SLNB and were more frequently located on trunk and upper limbs and observed in younger patients compared to melanomas with negative and positive SLNB. Overall survival of patients with INN showed no significant difference compared with negative SLNB (median follow-up of 5.7 years of all patients). Conclusions As there seems to be no difference in overall survival between patients with INN and negative SLNB, the diagnosis of INN seems to be reliable. Current practice to treat patients with INN as patients with negative SLNB appears to be appropriate.

TI  - Recent snow cover changes over central European low mountain ranges
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we simulated the snow water equivalent (SWE), rain-on-snow (ROS) events, evapotranspiration, and run-off for the period 1961-2016 in a central European region covered by low mountain ranges (<820 m a.s.l.) using a distributed hydrological model TRAnspiration and INterception evaporation model (TRAIN). We utilized improved cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products to evaluate the modelled snow-covered area, indicating a good performance of the snow modelling. We analysed the intra- and inter-annual variations of the simulated hydrological variables and the synchronous climate variables (air temperature and precipitation). Trend detection indicates a significant SWE decline throughout the snow season, but principally at the high elevations; the most severe warming occurred in early spring (March), whereas precipitation showed a slight increase in January and February. The snowpack in February has displayed the most striking reduction during the past 56 years, which is likely related to both the highest susceptibility of snow to warming and the increased ROS occurrence in February since the early 1990s. The increased combination of high temperatures and extreme rainfalls, as well as the earlier snowmelt, has resulted in a run-off increase during the earlier winter but a decrease in March. The expected changing climate towards warmer and wetter winters will probably exacerbate winter flooding in the future.

TI  - Spectral index-based dynamic threshold technique for detecting cloud contamination in ocean colour data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal and lagoon water colour products are often greatly contaminated by clouds and accompanying shadows. Adjacency effects due to the strong reflection from contiguous cloud pixels can introduce further uncertainty into the water-leaving radiance retrieval process. This study aims to propose a robust cloud-index dynamic-threshold (CIDT) algorithm based on the spectral and spatial characteristics of the clouds and evaluate its performance in comparison with results obtained from the existing algorithms using multispectral and hyperspectral images from the lagoon and coastal water zones. Detection of cloud contamination from these images is performed before applying atmospheric correction in order to prevent significant loss of valuable data and ensure the quality of higher-level products. The CIDT starts with data pre-processing (in order to avoid misclassification across the clouds and non-cloud regions) by excluding signatures other than the cloud and non-cloud (water and land) pixels. Based on the spectral and spatial variability characteristic of clouds, a new cloud index is then introduced that uses the top-of-atmosphere reflectance in conjugation with the dynamic threshold values to detect the cloud pixels. For quantitative and qualitative analyses, CIDT is tested on a number of scenes provided by Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) sensors over the coastal and lagoon zones. According to the comparison of the algorithm results with the reference cloud flags, CIDT shows a significant improvement in identifying clouds of varying opacity, achieves a higher cloud detection accuracy, and reduces the number of the previously misclassified pixels by other algorithms in different coastal and lagoon water regions. The CIDT is extensively tested in mid-latitude and tropical areas and CIDT can be applied to both multispectral and hyperspectral images over the lagoon and coastal zones without the need for ancillary information.

TI  - The Fever Coach Mobile App for Participatory Influenza Surveillance in Children: Usability Study
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Effective surveillance of influenza requires a broad network of health care providers actively reporting cases of influenza-like illnesses and positive laboratory results. Not only is this traditional surveillance system costly to establish and maintain but there is also a time lag between a change in influenza activity and its detection. A new surveillance system that is both reliable and timely will help public health officials to effectively control an epidemic and mitigate the burden of the disease.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the use of parent-reported data of febrile illnesses in children submitted through the Fever Coach app in real-time surveillance of influenza activities.Methods: Fever Coach is a mobile app designed to help parents and caregivers manage fever in young children, currently mainly serviced in South Korea. The app analyzes data entered by a caregiver and provides tailored information for care of the child based on the child's age, sex, body weight, body temperature, and accompanying symptoms. Using the data submitted to the app during the 2016-2017 influenza season, we built a regression model that monitors influenza incidence for the 2017-2018 season and validated the model by comparing the predictions with the public influenza surveillance data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).Results: During the 2-year study period, 70,203 diagnosis data, including 7702 influenza reports, were submitted. There was a significant correlation between the influenza activity predicted by Fever Coach and that reported by KCDC (Spearman rho=0.878; P<.001). Using this model, the influenza epidemic in the 2017-2018 season was detected 10 days before the epidemic alert announced by KCDC.Conclusions: The Fever Coach app successfully collected data from 7.73% (207,699/2,686,580) of the target population by providing care instruction for febrile children. These data were used to develop a model that accurately estimated influenza activity measured by the central government agency using reports from sentinel facilities in the national surveillance network.

TI  - Giant ice rings on lakes and field observations of lens-like eddies in the Middle Baikal (2016-2017)
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Giant ice rings (diameter 5-7 km) detected on lakes Baikal (Russia) and Hovsgol (Mongolia) are a surface manifestation of intrathermocline lens-like eddies under ice cover. By analyzing satellite imagery, we have detected new ice rings in 2016 and very old ones in 1969 for Lake Baikal. We have also discovered a giant ice ring on a new water body-Lake Teletskoye in the Altai Republic (Russia). Our recent field observations in the Middle Baikal have high temporal and spatial resolution and coverage and include temperature and current measurements over a long (1.5 month) period. In 2016, an eddy was detected in February and then an eddy and ice ring were detected in March at the same location. In 2017, another eddy was detected in February. This eddy was not stationary, as it was detected 6 km from its initial position in March, and thus no ice ring formed. The results of our field observations provide new data on the size and shape of the eddies. Indirect and direct measurements of currents and temporal evolution of the temperature field make it possible to estimate the rotation period (3 d) for the eddy in 2016 and assess the timing of movement, position, and displacement speed of the eddy in 2017. Thermal infrared Landsat imagery before ice formation in November-December 2015 shows that the eddy in 2016 was formed by the wind-induced outflow from the Barguzin bay.

T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a marine robotic system is designed to locate and to quantify the surface water pollution in lakes and ponds with the consideration of the influences of neighboring buildings and trees. The proposed system consists of an aerial robot and a marine robot, which are actuated by pattern recognition at the base station with safe path planning. In the designed system,on quadrotor a Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR) thermal imaging camera is employed to spot oil spills following a neural network method, while a wireless digital camera is used to identify the apropos path by imparting edge detection techniques. The surrounding buildings and trees dysfunction the digital camera's reflectivity, thereby disparate from optimal path planning. To dwindle the experimental impediment, the Voronoi algorithm is employed by fractionating the experiment's domain into small sub-sections. After that, Dijkstra's algorithm is considered to assure the optimal path planning from the starting point to the target. Fuzzy logic is introduced to direct boats towards the target. Global positioning system (GPS), sonar and navigation sensors based boat follow the trajectory defined by the aerial robot towards target point and take samples for quantification test through the spectrometer. These results then sent to the base station for pattern recognition using neural networks. Such systems can efficiently and effectively navigate the water pollution problems as disaster response.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background We report our experience in evaluating the severity of local influenza epidemics using the World Health Organization Pandemic Influenza Severity Assessment framework. Methods We assessed the severity of influenza by monitoring indicators of influenza transmissibility, seriousness of disease and impact on healthcare resource utilisation. Indicators were described by various parameters collected weekly from eight government hospitals, 20 government and 30 private primary care clinics, and the national public health laboratory. Transmissibility and seriousness of disease indicators were each represented by multiple parameters, and alert thresholds were set at the 70th and 90th percentile of a parameter's past 2-year surveillance data. We derived a collective measure for each indicator using the average percentile rank of the related parameters. Alert thresholds for the single impact parameter were set at predefined values and evaluated for its sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Results For the transmissibility and seriousness of disease parameters, calculation of the percentile rank was simple and independent of a parameter's underlying distribution. For the impact parameter, predefined alert thresholds had high sensitivity and specificity (>80%) but low positive predictive value (15%-30%). Assessment scales were used to qualitatively classify the activity of an indicator as low, moderate or high together with a confidence level. Conclusion We applied different methods for threshold setting depending on the attributes of each parameter and indicator. For indicators represented by multiple parameters, an aggregated assessment of the indicator's level of activity and confidence level of the assessment was needed for effective reporting.

Contemporary methods that only allow determination of prevalence of resistance are expensive, time consuming and require ethical considerations. A newer method involving Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) permits obtaining frequency of resistance while allowing to detect minority variants in mixed infections. Here, NGS was tested for P. falciparum resistance marker detection in mosquito samples as a feasible and suitable alternative for molecular resistance surveillance. Anopheles funestus were collected in southern Mozambique using CDC light traps and manual collections. DNA was extracted from either whole mosquito, head-thorax and abdomen separately or pools of five mosquitoes. These samples were screened for P. falciparum and if positive for k13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps and pfdhfr mutations related to anti-malarial drug resistance with Sanger sequencing and NGS. Results Among the 846 samples screened for P. falciparum, 122 were positive by 18S ssrDNA qPCR with an infection rate of 23.6%. No mutations were observed for k13 and pfcrt72-76 and almost zero for pfmdr86, but quintuple pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations were near fixation and about half of the isolates contained the pfmdr184F polymorphism. Similar allele frequencies of resistance markers were estimated with NGS in comparison with the prevalence of markers obtained with the gold standard Sanger sequencing. Conclusions Pooled deep sequencing of P. falciparum isolates extracted from mosquitoes is a promising, efficient and cost-effective method to quantify allele frequencies at population level which allows to detect known and unknown markers of resistance in single and mixed infections in a timelier manner. Using mosquitoes as sentinel group and focusing on allele frequency opposed to prevalence, permits active surveillance across a more homogeneous geographical range.

TI  - Evolution of the largest glacier in Mexico (Glaciar Norte) since the 50s: factors driving glacier retreat*
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of Mexican glaciers (19? N) in the climate context is poorly understood despite these glaciers are important indicators of regional climate change. The detailed patterns of glacier recession since the Little Ice Age (LIA) have exacerbated during the past years and decades. Their relationship to local and regional climate change needs further analysis. This study compares the changes of the largest glacier in Mexico, Glaciar Norte (GN), on Citlalt?petl Volcano with temperature, precipitation, and surface energy balance variations that were considered as part of climate forcing. Area, length, elevation, equilibrium line altitude (ELA), and thickness were calculated from historical and satellite data sets and a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model. The results showed that during the 1990s, prevailing warm and variable dry conditions enhanced the glacier retreat, triggering the disappearance of Jamapa glacier tongue. The glacier length has changed at the rate of ?20.7?m?a(?1) since 1958. ELA varied from 4999?m a.s.l. in 1958?5228?m a.s.l. in 2017. A short period of snow accumulation from 2007 to 2009 was found when the annual temperature over GN showed a noticeable negative trend similar to that for the accumulated surface energy balance. The surface energy balance was conclusive on the response of GN to stability or accumulation periods. Finally, the long-term variation of temperature was the only factor found forcing the glacier retreat. Assuming that the retreat rate (?0.02?km?a(?1)) and climate tendencies remained constant (0.1?C/decade), GN could disappear towards the middle of the twenty-first century.

TI  - Ungulates Attenuate the Response of Mediterranean Mountain Vegetation to Climate Oscillations
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions with a long-standing history of grazing pressure, vegetation has co-evolved with herbivores by developing intrinsic functional dynamics. Although this type of trophic interaction has been recognised as being important for shaping how vegetation responds to climate, better knowledge about how this process occurs on the landscape scale and over a long time range is necessary. Here, we evaluated the potential roles of herbivores in modulating the response of mountainous Mediterranean vegetation to seasonal and long-term climate oscillations. To understand the relations among climate, plants and animal population, we fitted a Bayesian model to a combination of long-term (1995-2014) climate datasets, satellite greenness maps (NASA Landsat NDVI) and exotic Barbary sheep census data (breeding success and abundance of Ammotragus lervia). We also used the intrinsic mode function and Hilbert spectrum transformations to decompose NDVI time series and to evaluate their periodic oscillations. We found remarkable dissimilarities as to how climate affects the temporal oscillation of vegetation greenness between landscapes both with and without ungulates, albeit their similarities under environmental conditions. Vegetation responses to climate are particularly attenuated in landscapes with ungulates, an effect that depends on ungulate population abundance. In a world where extreme climate events are becoming frequent and intense, our results indicate that ungulates can strongly modulate how grasslands and scrublands respond to climate change. Increasing our knowledge as to how this type of trophic interaction affects vegetation responses to climate variability is of much importance for managing ungulate rewilding strategies.

TI  - Deforestation in protect areas in the Amazon: a threat to biodiversity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The creation of protected areas (Protected Areas-CA and Indigenous Lands-IL) is one of the effective strategies to contain deforestation, and landscape fragmentation and conserve biodiversity. However, several such areas in the Amazon suffer from anthropogenic pressures which prevent the fulfilment of their purpose. The objective of this study is to analyze the use and vegetation cover in four protected areas in the Amazon in the state of Maranhao by showing the threats to biodiversity by means of digital processing of satellite images in 1984, 1996, 2008 and 2017. Images from the Landsat satellites 5 and 8 were used for supervised classification and identification of deforestation in these areas. The results obtained in 1984 show a predominance of the forest class in the studied area, where the ILs Caru and Alto Turiacu stand out for presenting excellent preservation in that year. As of 2008, changes related to deforestation and the presence of secondary vegetation and occurrence of fires in the area studied were observed. In this case, the changes resulting from urban and farming expansion, and infrastructure projects (roads, highways, dams and land division), mining, illegal logging, cattle raising, among others, are easily identified by satellite images. The Indigenous Lands and Strict Nature Reserve of Gurupi are connected, representing the best and the most homogeneous Amazonian biome in Maranhao. The study concludes that of the remaining vegetation, 76.41% is within the protected areas, represented mainly in the analyzed indigenous lands. So, this study highlights that although protected areas are being constantly deforested, invaded and criminally burned, these are still the best way of preserving the biodiversity of the last remnant of the Biome in the region, and its protection is necessary for the conservation of its biological resources and vegetation cover.

TI  - The Turkish SentiMAG feasibility trial: preliminary results
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is the standard of care for staging of the clinically and radiologically negative axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Sentinel node biopsy, with using Technetium-sulphur colloid (99 m Tc) alone or with blue dye is standard technique for evaluating axillary lymph nodes. This technique has drawbacks such as radiation exposure. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) can represent a valid option for SNB. In this study; we tried to evaluate feasibility of new magnetic technique in Turkish early breast cancer patients. Material and methods The study sample consists of 143 women affected by early breast carcinoma with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. Sentinel node localization was performed using magnetic technique. Detection rate of magnetic technique was calculated and postoperative complications were assessed. Results Results are based on 104 patients. Sentinel node identification rate was 99% (103/104, 95% CI 0.97-1.01) for magnetic technique. A median of two SNs per patient was removed. Major adverse reaction was the permanent skin coloration (7.1%). Conclusions The magnetic technique is a feasible method for detecting SN in breast cancer patients with minimal adverse effects. Magnetic technique may be alternative to standard technique especially in breast units, where nuclear medicine unit is not available.

TI  - Mapping Aboveground Biomass of Four Typical Vegetation Types in the Poyang Lake Wetlands Based on Random Forest Modelling and Landsat Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland biomass is an important indicator of wetland ecosystem health. In this study, four dominant vegetation communities (Carex cinerascens, Phalaris arundinacea, Artemisia selengensis, and Miscanthus sacchariflorus) in the Poyang Lake wetland from 2010 to 2016 were classified from Landsat images using spectral information divergence (SID). We combined aboveground biomass (AGB) field measurements and remote sensing data to establish a suitable model for estimating wetland AGB in Poyang Lake, which is on the Ramsar Convention's list of Wetlands of International Importance. The results showed that (1) overall, the classification accuracy for vegetation pixels across 5 years ranged from 59.1% to 73.7% and (2) the inter-annual and spatial variations in the AGB of the four vegetation types were clear. C. cinerascens had an average AGB density value of 1.28 kg m(-2) in Poyang Lake from 2010 to 2016; M. sacchariflorus had the highest AGB density with an average value of 1.39 kg m(-2); A. selengensis had almost the same level at 1.26 kg m(-2); and P. arundinacea had the lowest AGB density at 0.64 kg m(-2). This study provides useful experience for estimating carbon sequestration of vegetation in freshwater wetlands.

TI  - A novel terminal-processing application for utilizing satellite imagery in Mobile GIS
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The good network conditions are of great importance in most current mobile GIS systems for the application of satellite images, as most image processing and analyses are conducted on the server side, whereas the mobile device needs to frequently sent the requests and receive the outcomes of the server through the Internet. However, because of the poor network condition in isolated workplace of fieldworkers, it is difficult for them to have enough interactions with the server side efficiently. Therefore, a new terminal-processing prototype application, RSTools, for handling satellite images on the client side is designed to reduce dependence on good networks. The prototype allows users to conduct real-time operations, covering band math, color composite and rule-based image classifications for multi-source satellite images such as Landsat 8, WorldView2 and GaoFen-1. Compared to traditional remote sensing applications, this application is efficient at reducing not only the interactions times but also the time spent in obtaining the results of image processing in real-time, especially when the data transmission time is considered. As such, if the network condition is poor, the application will be a better choice to efficiently obtain results of satellite images in real-time.

TI  - Vineyard site suitability analysis by use of multicriteria approach applied on geo-spatial data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, multicriteria decision analysis with pairwise comparison weighting method was utilized to determine the suitable locations for vineyard plantation in Sarkoy region of Turkey. Soil maps, meteorological measurements, slope, aspect and elevation maps were used as input to conduct spatial analysis. Different methods were compared and pairwise comparison method was identified as the most appropriate method of weighting for this spatial analysis. Current vineyard areas were determined using Worldview-2 imagery and their spatial distribution compared with the resulting suitability map to determine the current suitability. Comparisons showed current vineyards were mostly established in locations where suitability map expresses low capability. Further inspection unveiled that, these low capability lands are closer to the transportation networks and city/county centres that tend to be in sea level elevations as opposed to vine grapes thriving in higher altitudes. Results also enabled providing suggestions on alternative sites for new vineyard plantation.

TI  - Regional influence of ocean-atmosphere teleconnections on the timing and duration of MODIS-derived snow cover in British Columbia, Canada
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover product to study the regional influence of the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on snow cover in British Columbia (BC). We apply a locally weighted regression (LOWESS) interpolation to the MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI) time series to detect the timing and duration of snow. We confirm the general consensus from many previous in situ studies that both ONI and PDO have significant impacts on snow cover in BC. We add to this knowledge by performing seasonal and regional analysis using established hydrozones and explore variation in our results by elevation bins of 500 m. We calibrated our method with in situ snow water equivalent (SWE) data and found an optimal NDSI threshold of 30 for detecting continuous snow cover. We separate automatic snow weather station data into calibration (75 %) and validation (25 %) subsets and obtain mean absolute errors between the MODIS and in situ observations for the start, end, and duration of 8.7, 8.9, and 13.1 d for the calibration data and 12.7, 12.6, and 16.6 d for the validation data, respectively. In general, the start date of snow is poorly correlated with both ONI and PDO, whereas the end date and duration are strongly negatively correlated. Regional patterns emerge wherein northern and southern BC are most correlated with the PDO and the ONI, respectively. These relationships are generally stronger at lower elevations and vary spatially. This study demonstrates that the suitability of ocean-atmosphere teleconnections as predictors of the timing and duration of snow varies throughout BC.

TI  - Improving the TROPOMI CO data product: update of the spectroscopic database and destriping of single orbits
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 13 October 2017, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was launched on the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit. One of the mission's operational data products is the total column concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), which was released to the public in July 2018. The current TROPOMI CO processing uses the HITRAN 2008 spectroscopic data with updated water vapor spectroscopy and produces a CO data product compliant with the mission requirement of 10% precision and 15% accuracy for single soundings. Comparison with ground-based CO observations of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) show systematic differences of about 6.2 ppb and single-orbit observations are superimposed by a significant striping pattern along the flight path exceeding 5 ppb. In this study, we discuss possible improvements of the CO data product. We found that the molecular spectroscopic data used in the retrieval plays a key role for the data quality where the use of the Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - Improved Atmospheric Spectroscopy Databases (SEOM-IAS) and the HITRAN 2012 and 2016 releases reduce the bias between TROPOMI and TCCON due to improved CH4 spectroscopy. SEOM-IAS achieves the best spectral fit quality (root-meansquare, rms, differences between the simulated and measured spectrum) of 1.5 x 10(-10) mol s(-1) m(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1) and reduces the bias between TROPOMI and TCCON to 3.4 ppb, while HITRAN 2012 and HITRAN 2016 decrease the bias even further below 1 ppb. HITRAN 2012 shows the worst fit quality (rms = 2.5 x 10(-10) mol s(-1) m(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1)) of the tested cross sections and furthermore introduces an artificial bias of about -1 .5 x 10(17) molec cm(-2) between TROPOMI CO and the CAMS-IFS model in the Tropics caused by the H2O spectroscopic data. Moreover, analyzing 1 year of TROPOMI CO observations, we identified increased striping patterns by about 16% percent from November 2017 to November 2018. For that, we defined a measure gamma, quantifying the relative pixel-to-pixel variation in CO in the crosstrack and along-track directions. To mitigate this effect, we discuss two destriping methods applied to the CO data a posteriori. A destriping mask calculated per orbit by median filtering of the data in the cross-track direction significantly reduced the stripe pattern from gamma = 2.1 to gamma = 1.6. However, the destriping can be further improved, achieving gamma = 1.2 by deploying a Fourier analysis and filtering of the data, which not only corrects for stripe patterns in the cross-track direction but also accounts for the variability of stripes along the flight path.

TI  - Retrieval of nearshore bathymetry from Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites in South Florida coastal waters
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the relatively high-resolution MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and 2B for generating bathymetric maps through a ratio transform model in South Florida (United States). Atmospheric correction of imagery is implemented though ACOLITE software, providing accurate performance and consistency over different Sentinel-2A/B scenes and three different study sites. Vertical calibration uses 5-10 points collected from digital charts, independent of lidar surveys, which are used for validation and error analysis. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has Median Absolute Error (MedAE) of 0.5 m in West Palm Beach (at depths ranging between 0 and 18 m, limit of lidar survey for validation), 0.4 m in Key West (0-5 m), and 0.22 m in Dry Tortugas (0-6 m), in conditions with low turbidity. Accurate bathymetry mapping can be accomplished with both sensors over environments with varying water transparency conditions, with the advantage of a fast, flexible, and economical solution. The 10-m MSI can capture small-scale features, such as tidal channels, straits relevant to navigation or steep slopes. While the least error is achieved by calibrating each image separately, a generic calibration produces only a moderately greater error with MedAE still similar to 1m, indicating the robustness of the approach. The research highlights the great potential of the 5-day revisit, suggesting that the twin Sentinel-2 mission of the Copernicus programme may enhance SDB to leverage its use for several operational purposes, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions of the world.

TI  - Frequency and implications of occipital and posterior auricular sentinel lymph nodes in scalp melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with scalp melanoma have poor oncologic outcomes compared with those with other cutaneous sites. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy provides prognostic information but is challenging in the head and neck. We explore the anatomic distribution of scalp melanoma and describe the most common sites of SLN drainage and of SLN metastatic disease. Methods Retrospective review of scalp melanoma patients who underwent SLN biopsy. Melanoma location was classified as frontal, coronal apex, coronal temporal, or posterior scalp. SLN location was classified by lymph node level and region. Results We identified 128 patients with scalp melanoma. The most common primary tumor location was the posterior scalp (43%) and the most frequent SLN drainage site was the level 2 lymph node basin (48%). Total 31 patients (24%) had metastatic disease in an SLN. Scalp SLNs, classified as being in the posterior auricular or occipital region, were localized in 26% of patients. For patients in which a scalp SLN was identified, 30% had a positive scalp SLN (n = 10). Conclusions Scalp SLNs are frequent drainage sites for scalp melanoma and, when found, have a 30% chance of harboring metastatic disease. Surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists should be vigilant in identifying, removing, and analyzing scalp SLNs.

TI  - Constraining Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds Over the Indian Subcontinent Using Space-Based Formaldehyde Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - India is an air pollution mortality hot spot, but regional emissions are poorly understood. We present a high-resolution nested chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) simulation for the Indian subcontinent and use it to interpret formaldehyde (HCHO) observations from two satellite sensors (OMI and GOME-2A) in terms of constraints on regional volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. We find modeled biogenic VOC emissions to be overestimated by similar to 30-60% for most locations and seasons, and derive a best estimate biogenic flux of 16 Tg C/year subcontinent-wide for year 2009. Terrestrial vegetation provides approximately half the total VOC flux in our base-case inversions (full uncertainty range: 44-65%). This differs from prior understanding, in which biogenic emissions represent >70% of the total. Our derived anthropogenic VOC emissions increase slightly (13-16% in the base case, for a subcontinent total of 15 Tg C/year in 2009) over RETRO year 2000 values, with some larger regional discrepancies. The optimized anthropogenic emissions agree well with the more recent CEDS inventory, both subcontinent-wide (within 2%) and regionally. An exception is the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where we find an underestimate for both RETRO and CEDS. Anthropogenic emissions thus constitute 37-50% of the annual regional VOC source in our base-case inversions and exceed biogenic emissions over the Indo-Gangetic Plain, West India, and South India, and over the entire subcontinent during winter and post-monsoon. Fires are a minor fraction (<7%) of the total regional VOC source in the prior and optimized model. However, evidence suggests that VOC emissions in the fire inventory used here (GFEDv4) are too low over the Indian subcontinent.

TI  - Drought offsets the positive effect of summer heat waves on the canopy greenness of mountain grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat waves are becoming more frequent in a warming climate and understanding the impacts of these extreme events on terrestrial ecosystems remains a major challenge. Seasonally snow-covered mountain grasslands are temperature-limited ecosystems and one may question whether the summer heat waves there have the same negative effect on primary productivity as they have on lowland ecosystems. Here, we examined the remotely-sensed phenology of mountain grasslands in the French Alps with a particular focus on the four unusually warm summers that occurred in 2003, 2012, 2015, and 2016. Our results showed that an early and rapid senescence and a lack of late-season regrowth were the most significant responses in 2003 and 2012 when heat waves coincided with climatic water deficit, i.e. negative anomalies of precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration. Mountain grasslands located below 2350 m were the most affected. In contrast, we found low senescence and moderate to high regrowth in 2015 and 2016 which were years unaffected by severe water deficit. When water was non-limiting, warm and even very warm summers have a positive effect on the canopy greenness of the highest grasslands, particularly by extending the green period in late summer and early fall. Our study highlights the pivotal role that summer water balance has in the phenological response of mountain grasslands exposed to heat waves.

TI  - Vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds over north-eastern South Asia: Aerosol-cloud interactions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eleven years of CALIOP and MODIS data are used to investigate the vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds and their possible interactions over the north-eastern South Asia (22-30 degrees N, 88-98 degrees E). Distinct seasonality in the vertical aerosol structure with the presence of elevated aerosol layers (EALs) is observed. The EALs vary from similar to 1.4 to 4.8 km in post monsoon to similar to 4.8-7.4 km in monsoon. Strong convective activities mainly in pre-monsoon and monsoon and upper air transportation of aerosols contribute to the formation of EALs. The contribution of polluted dust, polluted continental/smoke and elevated smoke are found to be predominant in the vertical column during pre-monsoon and monsoon. Contrarily, clean continental, clean marine and dusty marine are dominant during winter and post monsoon. Small spherical particles are abundant during winter while in monsoon hygroscopically grown spherical particles predominate. Seasonally, the cloud occurrence frequency (COF) as a function of altitude is maximum during monsoon. An increase in cloud top height (CTH) is observed within this region corresponding to an increase in number of cloud layers, thus revealing invigoration effect. The occurrence of cirrus and deep convective clouds is maximum in monsoon and minimum in the dry season. Significant inhibition/invigoration is observed for mixed-phase/liquid clouds.

TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of a bioremediation process in experimental soils polluted with chromium and lindane
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bioremediation using actinobacterium consortia proved to be a promising alternative for the purification of co contaminated environments. In this sense, the quadruple consortium composed of Streptomyces sp. M7, MC1, A5, and Amycolatopsis tucumanensis ABO has been able to remove significant levels of Cr(VI) and lindane from anthropogenically contaminated soils. However, the effectiveness of the bioremediation process could not be evaluated only by analytical monitoring, which is complex mainly due to the characteristics of the matrix, producing non-quantitative analyte recoveries, or interferences in the detection stage and quantification. However, the effectiveness of the bioremediation process cannot be evaluated only through analytical monitoring, which is complex due mainly to the characteristics of the matrix, to the recoveries of non-quantitative analytes or to interferences in the detection and quantification stage. For this reason, it is essential to have tools of ecological relevance to assess the biological impact of pollutants on the environment. In this context, the objective of this work was to establish the appropriate bioassays to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioremediation process of co-contaminated soils. For this, five model species were studied: four plant species (Lactuca saliva, Raphanus sativus, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays) and one animal species (Eisenia fetida). On plant species, the biomarkers evaluated were inhibition of germination (IG) and the length of hypocotyls/steam and radicles/roots of the seedling. While on E. fetida, mortality (M), weight lost, coelomocyte concentration and cell viability were tested. These bioindicators and the battery of biomarkers quantified in them showed a different level of sensitivity, from maximum to minimum: E. fetida > L. esculentum > L. saliva > R. sativus >> Z. mays. Therefore, E. fetida and L. esculentum and their respective biomarkers were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the bioremediation process due to the capability of assessing the effect on the flora and the fauna of the soil, respectively. The joint application of these bioindicators in a field scale bioremediation process is a feasible tool to demonstrate the recovery of the quality and health of the soil.

TI  - Mangrove metal pollution induces biological tolerance to Cd on a crab sentinel species subpopulation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Metals are persistent pollutants, able to accumulate in the biota andmagnify in trophicweb. In the specific case of cadmium contamination, it has been the subject of considerable interest in recent years because of its biological effects and it is one ofmajor pollutant in estuarine areas. Ucides cordatus is considered amangrove local sentinel crab species in Brazil and there are previous studies reporting crab subpopulations living frompristine to heavily metal impacted areas in Sao Paulo coast (Southeastern Brazil). Taking into account the background knowledge about these subpopulations, we proposed the hypothesis that crabs from a highly polluted mangrove (Cubatao - CUB) have developed biological tolerance to cadmium compared to animals from an Environmental Protected Area (Jureia-JUR). Aiming to verify this hypothesis, we have investigated total bioaccumulation and subcellular partition of Cd, besides biomarkers' responses during a long-termexposure bioassay (28 days, withweekly sampling) using a supposedly safe Cd concentration (0.0022 mg L-1). Specimens from the pristine area (JUR) accumulated higher total Cd, as such as in its biologically active form in gills. Animals living in the polluted site (CUB) presented higher amounts of Cd in themainly detoxifying tissue (hepatopancreas), which could be considered a pathway leading to tolerance for this metal. Multivariate analysis indicated that bioaccumulation (active, detoxified and total Cd) is linked to geno-cytotoxic damages. CUB subpopulationwas considered more tolerant since it presented proportionally less damage and more capacity to allocate Cd in themain detoxifying forms and tissues.

TI  - Three dimensional mapping of forest canopy equivalent water thickness using dual-wavelength terrestrial laser scanning
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, forests are being subjected to numerous threats, including climate change, wildfires, and insect and disease outbreaks, among others. Satellite optical remote sensing data have been widely utilized in early detection of tree and forest stress by estimating water status metrics such as the leaf Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). This estimate, however, is affected by soil characteristics and understory vegetation and often ignores the effects of the fine-scale heterogeneity of canopy structure and leaf water content. Such effects can be better understood by studying the EWT distribution in three dimensions. In this study, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) intensity data from the commercially-available Leica P20 and P40 instruments (808 nm and 1550 nm respectively) were combined in a Normalized Difference Index (NDI). NDI was used to map EWT of 12 trees in three dimensions from floor to canopy in a mixed broadleaf forest plot (Wytham Woods, UK). The average error in EWT estimates across three species was less than 8%. The three dimensional point clouds revealed that, in this snapshot, EWT changes vertically, usually increasing towards canopy top. The proposed method has the potential to provide predawn EWT measurements, is independent of solar illumination, and can lead to a better understanding of the factors affecting satellite estimation of EWT.

TI  - Mid and low-latitudinal ionospheric field-aligned currents derived from the Swarm satellite constellation and their variations with local time, longitude, and season
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the Field Aligned Currents (FAC) data of the 10 quietest days of each month of 2014-2018, the first four years of FAC observational data, derived from Swarm A and C satellites observations to study their characteristics within 15-55 degrees latitude in the northern and -15 degrees to -55 degrees latitude in the southern hemispheres. Results show that in summer months, the noon time FAC have the largest variations. Over the same sector region and the same local time, the FAC have the same trend irrespective of season.Examinations of seasonal patterns indicate that, both dawn and dusk times FACs in both hemispheres always have negative (southbound) variations during summer months. In winter months the dusk time FAC becomes positive only in the southern hemisphere, while the dawn time FAC is ambiguous as it becomes negative only at low latitudes. The noon time FAC is strongly positive (northbound), in both hemispheres in summer months, but during winter months it becomes southbound at mid-latitudes and remains northbound at low latitudes. Over the African, Asian and American sectors, the summer months FAC have identical structure, while in winter months the direction of the dawn and noon times FACs are ambiguous.At the foci points of the solar quiet (SQ) current, the northern hemispheric FAC has the same variation as those observed by Park et al. (2011) and Luhr et al. (2015) during summer months, while during winter months the noon time FAC is still weakly positive. The latitudinal variation of the FAC with respect to longitudes shows that the southern hemispheric FAC at mid-latitudes is always negative at eastern longitudes irrespective of season. It suggests that the FAC is longitudinally dependent.Unlike previous ground based studies, the satellite data not only shows a single prominent negative (southbound) FAC over the African sector region around equinoxes, but it shows that during the March equinox the dusk time FAC is always negative in both hemispheres except at western longitudes 45, where it has positive patterns. In the middle of summer and winter (months 7 and 1), the noon time FAC varies from positive in summer to negative in winter and the dawn time FAC varies from negative in summer to positive in winter which agrees with the theoretical prediction. The dusk time FAC in the northern hemisphere remains negative which agrees the observations of Park et al. (2011) and Luhr et al. (2015), while in the southern hemisphere it changes from negative in summer to positive in winter. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Evidence establishing effectiveness of influenza vaccination for prevention of severe illness is limited. The US Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) is a multiyear test-negative case-control study initiated in 2015-2016 to estimate effectiveness of vaccine in preventing influenza hospitalization among adults.Methods. Adults aged >= 18 years admitted to 8 US hospitals with acute respiratory illness and testing positive for influenza by polymerase chain reaction were cases; those testing negative were controls. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with logistic regression adjusting for age, comorbidities, and other confounding factors and stratified by frailty, 2-year vaccination history, and clinical presentation.Results. We analyzed data from 236 cases and 1231 controls; mean age was 58 years. More than 90% of patients had >= 1 comorbidity elevating risk of influenza complications. Fifty percent of cases and 70% of controls were vaccinated. Vaccination was 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-65%) and 53% (95% CI, 11%-76%) effective in preventing hospitalization due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B virus infection, respectively. Vaccine was protective for all age groups.Conclusions. During the 2015-2016 US influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant season, we found that vaccination halved the risk of influenza-association hospitalization among adults, most of whom were at increased risk of serious influenza complications due to comorbidity or age.

TI  - Detected global agricultural greening from satellite data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global vegetation greening trend in the past three decades has been detected from satellite observations, but few studies focused on agricultural greening. We used two long-term satellite LAI datasets and statistical methods to verify a significant greening trend in global cropland from 1982 to 2015. Agricultural greening trends [6.55 +/- 1.38 (10(-3) m(2) m(-2) yr(-1))] are more than twice that of natural vegetation [3.15 +/- 0.89 (10(-3) m(2) m(-2) yr(-1))] within the key agricultural zone in the Northern Hemisphere (10 degrees N-50 degrees N). Agricultural greening contributes near one-third (27.4% +/- 4.3%) of Northern Hemisphere greening. In less developed regions (Asia, South America, and Africa), the primary reasons for agricultural greening are cropland expansion and cropping systems reforming in a way that extends growing seasons, whereas in developed regions (North America, Australia and Europe) these are agricultural intensification (Green Revolution). Agricultural greening trends in less developed regions are greater than in developed regions. Agricultural intensification is accompanied by cropland decreases within developed regions, whereas this is accompanied by cropland expansion in less developed regions, which is different from previous conclusions that "agricultural intensification was not generally accompanied by decline or stasis in cropland area." Our results suggest that global cropland is experiencing significant eco-environmental changes. The roles that agricultural greening plays in global environmental and climatic changes are worthy of further research.

TI  - Middle Atmosphere Temperature Trends in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries Simulated With the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model simulations made under various climate change scenarios to study the evolution of the global-mean temperature trend in the late twentieth century and the twenty-first century. Results are compared with available satellite observations, including new trend estimates derived from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument on NASA's TIMED spacecraft. Modeled and observed trends are shown to be consistent throughout the entire middle atmosphere, from near the tropopause (similar to 16 km) to the lower thermosphere (similar to 95 km) in the period covered by the satellite data. Simulations are extended into the twenty-first century to document the evolution of the global-mean temperature trend profile. We find, consistent with previous studies, a marked change in the trend profile at the turn of the twenty-first century, which is driven by the recovery of stratospheric ozone following the adoption of the Montreal Protocol. In the twenty-first century, the trend profile becomes more uniform with altitude, but its overall shape and magnitude are conditioned by the scenario adopted for future emissions of greenhouse gases. Our results suggest that the vertical profile of temperature trends in the middle atmosphere will remain an important signature of global climate change, and they underscore the importance of global, continuous monitoring of this region of the atmosphere.

TI  - Investigating extracted total precipitable water vapor from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and MODIS measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total Precipitable Water (TPW) vapor value in the earth's atmosphere and its variations are of great importance in atmospheric and climatic studies. Among the most important methods introduced for estimation of TPW are satellite products such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and numerical methods such as Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). The performance of TPW estimation methods are different in various locations and require evaluations. Then, the goal of this study is investigating the performance of estimated TPW from MODIS product (MOD05) and WRF model. In this regard, two infrared (IR) and near infrared (NIR) algorithms of MOD05 were evaluated. Moreover, three nested resolutions of 27, 9, and 3 km of the WRF in 0000 and 1200 UTC were investigated. Mehrabad radiosonde station in the south of Tehran, Iran was considered as the study area. Evaluation of the two selected models was performed using radiosonde measurements of 240 days in 2013 and 2014. Among the nested domains for WRF model, the 3 km model at 0000 UTC provided the best results with determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.81 and Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of 2.98 mm. Among the MODIS products, MODIS IR showed a better performance with R-2 of 0.72 and RMSD of 3.46 mm. In general, the estimated TPW from MODIS-IR and WRF3 showed that WRF has a better performance. Then, the results proved that WRF model can be used in various meteorological conditions for estimation TPW with an acceptable accuracy.

TI  - Assimilation of remote sensing into crop growth models: Current status and perspectives
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Timely monitoring of crop lands is important in order to make agricultural activities more sustainable, as well as ensuring food security. The use of Earth Observation (EO) data allows crop monitoring at a range of spatial scales, but can be hampered by limitations in the data. Crop growth modelling, on the other hand, can be used to simulate the physiological processes that result in crop development. Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models. We use this to introduce a solid and robust framework for DA, where different DA methods are shown to be derived from taking different assumptions in solving for the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) using Bayes' rule. This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications. We comment on current computational challenges in scaling DA applications to large spatial scales. Future areas of research are sketched, with an emphasis on DA as an enabler for blending different observations, as well as facilitating different approaches to crop growth models. We have illustrated this review with a large number of examples from the literature.

TI  - The Dark Triad traits in Australia and Turkey
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary contention of evolutionary models of the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) is that they are adaptations for dealing with adverse socioecological circumstances. In this study (N = 557), we collected data from two countries that differ in socioecological conditions (i.e., Turkey and Australia). We measured perceptions of a dangerous and competitive world and individual differences in the Dark Triad traits. Turkish participants were higher in the Dark Triad traits than Australian participants were. All the Dark Triad traits were correlated with a competitive but not a dangerous worldview. Country-level differences in the Dark Triad traits were mediated by competitive worldviews, but not dangerous worldviews, and those effects were similar in each sex. And rates of narcissism depended on participant's sex and country. This study provided the first attempt to understand country-level differences in the Dark Triad traits using a life history framework.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery for the identification and determination of forest patches of particular interest, with respect to ecosystem integrity and biodiversity and to produce a relevant biodiversity map, based on Simpson's diversity index in Taxiarchis university research forest, Chalkidiki, North Greece. The research is based on OBIA being developed on to bi-temporal summer and winter Sentinel-2 imagery. Fuzzy rules, which are based on topographic factors, such as terrain elevation and slope for the distribution of each tree species, derived from expert knowledge and field observations, were used to improve the accuracy of tree species classification. Finally, Simpson's diversity index for forest tree species, was calculated and mapped, constituting a relative indicator for biodiversity for forest ecosystem organisms (fungi, insects, birds, reptiles, mammals) and carrying implications for the identification of patches prone to disturbance or that should be prioritized for conservation.

TI  - Physical and non-physical factors driving urban heat island: Case of Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on two aspects of the urban heat island (UHI). Firstly, the study is aimed at examining the difference in temperature between zones that are classified into different built areas and other land cover types instead of using the urban and rural classification, which is prevalent in the existing literature. Secondly, we consider the heat-intensity-related physical structure of the city such as the sky view, building coverage, building height, surface albedo, and pervious and impervious surfaces, as well as non-physical factors such as anthropogenic heat, travel demand, electricity consumption, and air pollutant concentration. The local climate zone (LCZ) is used as an approach for characterizing the landscape and physical structure of the study areas. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is used as the case study and 2016 as the base year for examination. The LCZ is classified using Landsat data and the training areas are created using Google Earth and Google Street View. The heat intensity is studied by deriving the land surface temperature (LST) from the thermal band of the Landsat satellite images of March 3, April 4, and April 12, in 2016, which represent the summer season in Bangkok. The result shows that the industry building areas have the highest mean LST is 32.41 degrees C, while the lowest LST is 28.32 degrees C in areas of water bodies; the temperature difference was approximately 4 degrees C. The factors significantly influencing the warming in the BMA are pervious and impervious surfaces, the building coverage ratio, and the anthropogenic heat flux, while the sky view factor, vehicular traffic, and air pollutant concentration are the weak drivers of UHI.

TI  - Tectonic geomorphology and structural architecture of eastern Sulaiman Fold Thrust Belt (SFTB) and adjacent Sulaiman Foredeep (SF), northwest Pakistan
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation combines a number of datasets to provide an enhanced and improved tectono-geomorphological framework with which to identify new possible structural lineaments in northwest Pakistan. The dataset includes satellite images and geographic information system (GIS) methods. The present study was carried out using the USGS ASTER DEM (30 m), Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) and surface field geology of the study area. Different band combinations, directional filters and principle component analysis (PCA) methods were used to identify the major structural styles and tectonic geomorphological pattern. The panchromatic band (Band-8) was applied to the Landsat 8 satellite images in order to increase the spatial resolution from 30 m to 15 m which aided in the investigation and comparative analysis of tectonic geomorphology and structural styles. Drainage patterns of Zindapir Anticline (ZA), Sakhi Sarwar (SS), Sulaiman Foredeep (SF) and Kingri Fault (KF) areas were generated using Strahler order of streams. The results suggested a combination of the dendritic network with a minor component of trellis pattern for ZP and SF areas, hence proposing a combined structural and stratigraphic/lithological control, whereas the KF area indicated an element of a rectangular pattern suggesting a more structural influence in the western part in comparison to the eastern region. The presence of water gaps (WaGs) and active drainage network indicate lateral growth and propagation directions of the ZP and SS frontal anticlines following the Paleocene Epoch. The geomorphic evidence coupled with satellite data show that the SFTB is tectonically active along with the adjacent SF. The stream courses are deflected or guided due to active folds and tectonics in the area characterized by the distinct fluvial erosional pattern on the flanks/limbs of ZA. Evidence from the study suggests that compressional deformation, uplift and erosion played a significant role in the shaping of the structural and depositional architecture of the basin. It is proposed that the deformation in the SFTB during the late Paleogene is related to the Indian-Eurasian oblique collision, while the subsequent late Tertiary collision of Indian Plate with the Afghan Block (an accreted part of southern Eurasia) further ensued compressive deformation. The results from this study elucidate the possible models proposed for this compressional regime with prevailing wrenching by presenting new data. The findings from this research reveal new tectono-geomorphological features and lineaments in the area that were not documented previously. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition from solid-state bonding of the stainless steel 304L (SS) with Zircaloy-4 (Zy-4) to a partial liquid phase bonding is very important for the bonding process at 950-1050 degrees C. Previous studies demonstrate that the growth rate of the reaction product zone (RPZ) at 1050 degrees C show an intermediate behaviour which is interesting from an industrial point of view regarding the partial phase bonding process. In this work, the interfacial interactions between SS and Zy-4 during isothermal holdings at 1050 degrees C are studied for holding times up to 45 min. Diffusion couples were characterized by ESEM-EDS-EBSD and EPMA techniques. The RPZ consists of three layers: the first layer LI consists of alpha-(Fe,Cr) phase and its thickness increases very slightly with the holding time. On the contrary, the thickness, the morphology and the nature of the phases formed in the LII and LIII layers strongly depend on the interaction time. Based on the experimental results of this study, a schematic evolution of SS/Zy-4 system and mechanisms of interfacial interactions during isothermal holdings at 1050 degrees C are proposed. This study leads to a better understanding of the complex phenomena intervening in the SS/Zy-4 joining process which is very useful for applications in industrial scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of leaf area index from various sources on estimating gross primary production in temperate forests using the JULES land surface model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of various types of leaf area index (LAI) on simulations of stand scale gross primary production (GPP) in evergreen needleleaf (TCK) and deciduous broadleaf (TBK) temperate forests were analyzed using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (LSM). LAI was observed during the period from 2015 to 2017 with an LAI-2200 plant canopy analyzer. Other LAIs included the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of two satellites with different temporal and spatial resolutions (Landsat and MODIS), the LAI product of MODIS, and the JULES phenology model. These LAIs were compared with in situ observations of LAI, and their effects on GPP simulation were compared with simulated GPP using in situ observed LAI (GPPobs). Our results show that the JULES phenology model does not adequately express the LAI of either TCK or TBK forests. This misrepresentation was improved through simple modifications. LAI data from a remote-sensing EVI corresponded relatively well with the observations, whereas the MODIS LAI product, with a relatively low spatial resolution (500 m), could not discern the complex heterogeneity of a temperate forest and provided a 31% higher maximum value. Compared with GPPobs, the difference in annual GPP was smaller than in LAI, ranging from -3.48% to 6.0% in TCK and -6.52% to 10.9% in TBK. The differences in seasonal GPP estimates were up to 14.6% in spring for TCK and -17.4% in autumn for TBK. Our study identified limitations of the JULES leaf phenology model, and suggested modifications to reduce the differences in GPP estimation for temperate forests at the stand scale. In addition, we suggested using sufficiently high spatial resolution data, especially for LAI, as inadequately represented forest cover types resulted in seasonal GPP discrepancies.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variations Aquatic Vegetation Cover and the Potential Influencing Factors in Lake Hongze Bused on MIDI Images
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic vegetation is an important part of lake ecosystems and plays a vital role in improving water quality and maintaining biodiversity. At present, China's lakes are facing eutrophication and the degradation of aquatic vegetation. The monitoring of temporal and spatial variations in aquatic vegetation and elucidating the main influencing factors are of great significance for protecting aquatic vegetation and restoring eutrophic lake ecosystems. Therefore, we introduced the Vegetation Present Frequency (VPF) method to extract data on aquatic vegetation and combined this with meteorological factors and human activities to analyze the temporal and spatial in Lake Hongze based on MODIS data from 2007 to 2017. The VPF of aquatic vegetation in Lake Hongze showed clear seasonal and interannual variations. The VPF was significantly higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter (P < 0.05, one way-ANOVA). The maximum VPF of 0.43 occurred in June but the minimum VPF of 0.21 was recorded in January. The VPF from April to October, during the growing season of aquatic vegetation, was significantly higher than in other months. The annual mean VPF of the northern lake area (Z1) decreased significantly (R-2 = 0.56, P < 0.01), ranging from the highest value of 0.50 in 2008 to the lowest value of 0.27 in 2016 (a decrease of 45.8%), indicating a significant loss of aquatic vegetation. Spatially, the VPF of Lake Hongze decreases from the coastal zone to the open water, and the VPF values of the northern (Z1) and western sub-lakes (Z2) are higher than that of other lakes segments (Z3-Z5). The interannual variation in VPF for the entire lake was not significantly affected by annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, annual mean wind speed, or annual sunshine duration (P > 0.05), indicating that meteorological factors have little influence on interannual variation of aquatic vegetation in this lake. However, total suspended matter concentration was significantly negatively correlated with VPF in Z1 area (R-2 = 0.48, P < 0.01), with strong sand-mining activities occurring in this area. These results indicate that the increase of total suspended matter concentrations caused by sand mining is an important driving factor in the decline of aquatic vegetation in the Z1 segment.

TI  - Multitemporal Landsat-MODIS fusion for cropland drought monitoring in El Salvador
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop an approach to characterize cropland drought conditions in El Salvador, Central America. The data were processed for 2016-2017 through three main steps: (1) reconstructing MODIS land-surface temperature (LST), (2) Landsat-MODIS data fusion and (3) drought delineation using the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). The results of LST reconstruction using the random forests (RF) indicated the median RMSE value of 0.5 degrees C. The fusion results achieved from the STARFM compared with the reference Landsat data revealed close agreement with the correlation coefficient (r) values higher than 0.84. The TVDI results verified with that from the reference Landsat data indicated r values of 0.85 and 0.75 for 2016 and 2017, respectively. The larger very dry area was observed for the 2016 primera season due to prolonged droughts. Approximately 11.5% and 10.7% of croplands were, respectively, associated with very dry moisture condition in the 2016 and 2017 primera seasons.

TI  - Improving corn yield prediction across the US Corn Belt by replacing air temperature with daily MODIS land surface temperature
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While canopy temperature has been extensively utilized for field-level crop health assessment, the application of satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) images for corn yield modeling has been limited. Furthermore, long term yield projections in the context of climate change have primarily employed air temperature (Tair) and precipitation, which may inadequately reflect crop stress. This study assessed potential benefits of satellite-derived LST for predicting annual corn yield across the US Corn Belt from 2010 to 2016. A novel killing degree day metric (LST KDD) was computed with daily LST images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and compared to the typically used Tair-based metric (Tair KDD). Our findings provide strong evidence that LST KDD is capable of predicting annual corn yield with less error than Tair KDD (R-2/RMSE of 0.65/15.3 Bu/Acre vs. 0.56/17.2 Bu/Acre). Even while adjusting for seasonal temperature and precipitation parameters, the R-2 and RMSE of the LST model were approximately 9% higher and 2.0 Bu/Acre lower than the Tair model, respectively. The superior performance of LST can be attributed to its ability to better incorporate evaporative cooling and water stress. We conclude that MODIS LST can improve yield forecasts several months prior to harvest, especially during extremely warm and dry growing seasons. Furthermore, the better performance of LST models over Tair and precipitation models suggest that subsequent long term yield projections should consider additional factors indicative of water stress.

TI  - A flood of information: Using Sentinel-3 water colour products to assure continuity in the monitoring of water quality trends in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational method to assess trends in marine water composition and ecosystem health during flood periods has been developed for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Queensland, Australia. This method integrates satellite water colour data with field water quality and ecosystem monitoring data and involves the classification of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS satellite) pixels into six distinct water bodies using a "wet season" colour scale developed specifically for the GBR. Using this information, several monitoring and reporting products have been derived and are operationally implemented into a long-term water quality monitoring program for the GBR. However, MODIS sensors are aging and a long-term monitoring solution is needed. This study reviewed the water colour monitoring products currently used in the GBR. It tested the feasibility to transition these methods from historical MODIS satellite imagery to the new Sentinel-3 satellite of the European Space Agency and from the wet season colour scale to the historical Forel-Ule colour scale, using a freely-distributed Forel Ule (FU) Satellite Toolbox. Monitoring products derived from both satellites and colour scales showed very similar patterns across two case study regions of the GBR, the Wet Tropics and Burdekin marine regions, over the 2017-18 wet season. The results obtained in this study highlighted the potential of using FU Sentinel-3 imagery for the mapping of GBR marine water bodies, including flood conditions. Furthermore, the operational monitoring products and frameworks developed for the GBR are likely to provide valuable foundations for analysis of FU Sentinel-3 data in the future. Such satellite water colour datasets and frameworks will be instrumental to better understand the impact of floods and reduced water clarity on marine ecosystems, as well as to support water quality management and facilitate catchment management policy in the GBR and worldwide.

TI  - Understanding spatial variations of malaria in Vietnam using remotely sensed data integrated into GIS and machine learning classifiers
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the potentials of remotely sensed data, GIS and some machine learning classifiers and ensemble techniques in the investigation of the non-linear relationship between malaria occurrences and socio-physical conditions in the Dak Nong province of Viet Nam. Accuracy assessment was determined with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and pair t-test. The results showed that the area under ROC of Random Subspace ensemble model performed better than the other models based on statistical indicators. Comparing pair t-test with Area Under Curve values showed a slight difference of about 1%. Therefore ensemble techniques had significantly improved the performance of the base classifier. However, the performances might vary according to geographic locations. It is concluded that the machine learning classifiers combined with remotely sensed data and GIS is promising for malaria vulnerability mapping, and the derived maps can be used as a fundamental basis for programmes on spatial disease control.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data plays an important role in extracting thematic information from various sensors having different spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions. The present study aims at fusion of Radar Imaging Satellite-1 Fine Resolution Stripmap-1 and ResourceSAT-2 Linear Imaging Self Scanning Scanner-4 (LISS-4) images over Indian Antarctic Research Station Maitri and its surroundings to generate a better product which contains the characteristics of both the spectral information from LISS-4 and the spatial details of SAR. Different pixel-based fusion techniques such as Brovey Transform, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Intensity Hue Saturation and Wavelet Principal Component Analysis (W-PCA) have been used in the present study. These image fusion techniques have been applied for the whole scene as well as for individual surface features like melt ponds, crevasses, freshwater lake, blue ice, oasis and lake ice for better discrimination of features. Quality assessment is performed by evaluating the performance of these algorithms using visual, spatial (High Pass Correlation Coefficient and Entropy) and spectral (Root Mean Square Error, Correlation Coefficient, ERGAS and Universal Quality Index) parameters. It is found that the identification of certain features such as crevasses, blue ice, melt ponds and lake ice has been improved with fused images compared to the original multi-spectral and SAR images. PCA and W-PCA fusion techniques offer better performance as compared to the rest of the techniques.

TI  - Local land surface temperature change induced by afforestation based on satellite observations in Guangdong plantation forests in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the effects of large scale afforestation is essential for the accurate understanding of its potential for the mitigation of climate warming. We used satellite observations to quantify the effects of the conversion of open lands (i.e., grassland and cropland) and natural forests to plantation forests and their associated biophysical processes (i.e., albedo and evapotranspiration (ET)) on land surface temperature (LST) in Guangdong Province, China. The hypothetical change (mean 2002-2018 values of LST difference between plantation forests and nearby lands in 2010) using the moving window searching-based method and actual change (changes of afforested area affecting the LST difference from 2000 to 2010) using the spatial pattern change trend method were detected in order to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, related albedo, and ET. The relationships between albedo, ET, and surface temperature change were also determined in combination with interpolated air temperature and precipitation. Results showed that the two methods-based afforestation changes had a similar net cooling effect, but a discrepancy in diurnal, seasonal, and spatial variations occurred. Overall, the actual change of afforested area led to a cooling effect by an average of -0.18 +/- 0.02 degrees C, especially from croplands, which was greater than the air temperature. Individually, afforestation in the mid-subtropical forest zone (north of 24 degrees N, northern Guangdong) had a warming effect, especially during the transition from natural forests to plantation forests. We also observed an increase in cooling for the tropical forest zone across latitudes. Warming during the dry season was triggered by the albedo from plantation forests, but the albedo-induced forest cover change impacts on LST were quite complex. Meanwhile, ET dominated the cooling during the wet season and warm season. Additionally, enhanced precipitation played a more prominent role in the ET-induced cooling. Evaluation of the effect of temperature change induced by afforestation illustrates the importance of protecting natural forests and avoiding extensive artificial afforestation, especially in northern Guangdong Province, and reverting agricultural land to forest, especially in western Guangdong Province. This analysis also provides a basis for feedback from forest management activities to climate change in southern China.

TI  - Temporal trends of mercury differ across three northern white-tailed eagle (<i>Haliaeetus albicilla</i>) subpopulations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal trends of mercury (Hg) are crucial for the understanding of this ubiquitous and toxic contaminant. However, uncertainties often arise from comparison among studies using different species, analytical and statistical methods. The long-term temporal trends of Hg exposure were reconstructed for a key sentinel species, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). Body feathers were sampled from museum collections covering 150 years in time (from 1866 to 2015) from West Greenland (n = 124), Norway (n = 102), and Sweden (n = 87). A significant non-linear trend was observed in the Norwegian subpopulation, with a 60% increase in exposure occurring from 1866 to 1957 followed by a 40% decline until 2015. In the Swedish subpopulation, studied at a later period, the Hg exposure showed a drastic decline of 70% from 1967 to 2011. In contrast, no significant trend could be observed in the Greenland subpopulation. The additional analysis of dietary proxies (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in general increased performance of the temporal trend models, but this was dependent on the subpopulation and study period. The downward trend of Hg coincided with the decreasing delta C-13 and delta N-15 in the Norwegian subpopulation, suggesting a potential dietary mitigation of Hg contamination. Hg exposure in both the Greenland and Norwegian subpopulations was consistently below the suggested threshold for adverse health effects (40.0 mu g g(-1)), while the maximum exposure in the Swedish subpopulation was distinctively elevated ( median: 46.0 mu g g(-1)) and still remains well above natural background concentrations (maximum 5.0 mu g g(-1)).

TI  - Validation of POLDER-3/GRASP aerosol products using AERONET measurements over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The third generation of Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance instrument (POLDER-3) aerosol products provide aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine aerosol optical depth (AODF), coarse aerosol optical depth (AODC), absorbed aerosol optical depth (AAOD), the angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), complex refractive index (CRI, CRI = n + i kappa) and single scattering albedo (SSA). These properties are essential for understanding the effects of aerosol on climate changes. However, the performance of those aerosol optical properties has not been validated in China. This study provides the first validation of all the POLDER-3/GRASP aerosol optical properties using ground measurements at 15 AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations over China. The comparison shows that the correlation coefficient is 0.9530/0.9587/0.6371/0.5566/0.09/0.5835/0.6834 between POLDER-3/GRASP AOD/AODF/AAOD/AODC/n/kappa/SSA and that of AERONET stations. There are less than 49.9%/85.9%/54.4% of the AOD/AODF/AODC values falling within the Expected Error (EE, +/- (0.05 + 15%)) envelopes. The performance of POLDER-3 AOD is close to the MODIS and VIIRS dark-target (DT) AOD. The monthly POLDER-3 AOD are overestimated and SSA are underestimated in SACOL and Xianghe. Different land cover types affect the AODC retrieval significantly and high aerosol loading (AOD > 1) will cause the underestimation of AOD. These results indicate that the POLDER-3 aerosol product is more sensitive to fine aerosol type.

TI  - Examining spatiotemporal salinity dynamics in the Mekong River Delta using Landsat time series imagery and a spatial regression approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most coastal areas globally face water shortages in the dry season due to salinization and drought. The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is recognized as the "Rice Bowl" in Vietnam but the negative effects of salinization and drought have damaged rice production in recent decades. However, regional assessment of the perturbation has been lacking. A Landsat-based satellite salinity index, the Enhanced Salinity Index (ESI), was developed in this study to explore patterns of annual salinity variations in agricultural land and their relationship to drought in the MRD from 1989 to 2018. The performance of the index was superior to that of other previously published remotely sensed indices, based on correlations with field measurements of electrical conductivity (i.e. groundwater and soil EC), which can be used as a proxy for salinity. The time-series ESI was then utilized to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of salinity in the study area using the Theil-Sendmedian trend (TS) and Mann-Kendall significance tests (MK). In addition, temporal relationships with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were used to investigate the relationship between drought and saline intrusion. Our results showed that freshwater and brackish areas increased inland, whereas those developed for shrimp farming may increase soil and groundwater salinity. A negative correlation between drought and salinity was also observed in surface water where fish and shrimp farming activities took place, while a positive relationship was discovered in rice and annual cropland areas. This study highlights the use of ESI as an effective parameter for modelling vegetation salinity and its relationship with cropland change. We also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating satellite imagery with spatiotemporal analyses to monitor and assess regional salinization dynamics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in mangrove vegetation, aquaculture and paddy cultivation in the Mekong Delta: A study from Ben Tre Province, southern Vietnam
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyzed the changes in mangrove forests along the coastal districts of Ben Tre Province in Mekong Delta, in southern Vietnam from 1998 to 2015 using Landsat image series (TM and OLI) using vegetation and water indices, and field data. Decadal changes in aquaculture ponds and area of rice crops were also estimated using satellite and field data in order to understand the influence of intensive aquaculture on mangrove deforestation and agriculture in this region. Furthermore, predictions have been made on the changes in mangrove forests, rice crops and aquaculture ponds in case of 1 m and 2 m sea level rise. About 52.5% of the mangrove forests were cleared between 1998 and 2015 for aquaculture and infrastructure developments in Ben Tre during the study period. Thanh Phu District showed highest loss of mangrove forests (59.3%) and increase in the area covered by aquaculture ponds (120%) during this period. Overall reduction in the rice crops areas in Ben Tre was 23.4% whereas this was 31.5% in the coastal districts due to the conversion of freshwater rice fields into brackish shrimp ponds. It is estimated that a 1 m rise in the current sea level would clear 45.2% of the remaining mangrove forests, 60.9% of the current areas planted with rice, 65% of the aquaculture ponds and 46% of the entire province would be under the water. This study shows a clear picture of the coastal environmental changes going on in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.

TI  - A new spatial modeling and interpolation approach for high-resolution temperature maps combining reanalysis data and ground measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite of their increasing importance as inputs to models for a wide range of scientific fields, high-resolution meteorological variables are not recorded very often on spatially regular grids. This problem is usually overcome by using data from reanalysis models, although they are less accurate. This paper discusses the development of a new spatial downscaling methodology to provide high-resolution maps of daily maximum and minimum air temperature. The application of this approach provides thorough observations in sparsely sampled areas by combining the accuracy of measurements from ground-based stations with the high availability and uniformity of model-based data. The dataset includes more than a decade (2003-2013) of data collected at 113 stations, about 30% of which constituted an independent set for the validation procedure. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated using statistical scores that are regularly employed in model evaluation studies and the improvements over the classical approach are remarkable. The results show that overall the our "hybrid" method provides fair estimates of temperature values. Particularly, MBE is less than 0.29 degrees C and 0.60 degrees C for the daily maximum and minimum air temperature respectively; RMSE is less than 1.24 degrees C for the maximum temperature and 1.86 degrees C for the minimum temperature, the analysis on MAE assures that there is not contribution of the errors in the spatial variability (MAE approximate to RMSE). The correlation coefficient, close to 1 (rho approximate to 0.97), indicates a strong positive linear relationship.

TI  - Evaluation of MACC Reanalysis Ozone Data over China Using Ground-based and AIRS Satellite Observation
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparative analysis was conducted using total ozone products derived from monitoring atmospheric composition and climate (MACC) reanalysis data validated with ozone data from the atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) satellite and ground-based ozone measurements. The results indicate that the relative deviation of total ozone from the MACC reanalysis data and the ground-based ozone total data is controlled within 17%, and all of the correlation coefficients were between 0.79 and 0.97. The total ozone values from the MACC reanalysis data showed good consistency with the ground-based ozone measurements. With respect to the spatial distribution of multi-year averages, the relative deviation of total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data and the AIRS satellite data was between -3% and 5%. The total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data were higher than those from AIRS measurements for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the coastal areas of South China, and were lower for northeast China. Furthermore, the seasonal variations in total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data were consistent with AIRS data. At Mt. Waliguan station, the monthly averaged trends for near-surface ozone in the MACC reanalysis data were also consistent with surface ozone concentrations; the MACC reanalysis data reflect the observed trends for surface-based ozone measurements in spring, summer, and autumn, but show a large deviation in winter.

TI  - Characteristics and transport mechanism of the Nyixoi Chongco rock avalanche on the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For studying rock avalanches, complex surficial and internal characteristics have been regarded as important indicators for understanding avalanche transport mechanism. In the present study, deposits of a massive Holocene rock avalanche, termed the Nyixoi Chongco rock avalanche, located on the Lhasa Terrane of Tibetan Plateau in China are investigated, based on a combination of remote sensing data and in-situ observations. It is revealed that abundant surface landforms, including Toreva blocks, longitudinal and transverse ridges, en echelon ridges, and hummocks, are commonly developed. Corresponding to these surface morphologies, a series of internal sedimentary structures, including jigsaw structures, inner shear zones, aligned clasts, diapiric structures, convoluted laminations, and basal decollements, are also well developed. Through an analysis of these surficial and internal characteristics, we propose that a rapid motion, similar to a laminar flow, most likely occurred after the avalanche mass detaching from the source area. In this process, the detached avalanche mass was mainly emplaced by a frictional, simple shear process characterized by a bulldozing effect that occurred between the sliding mass and the substrate. From the proximal to the distal sections of the avalanche, the transport of the rock mass can be classified into four major processes: an extension-dominated sliding process in the transition zone, a compression-dominated sliding process in subzones III-1 and III-2 of the accumulation zone (III), a sliding process co-dominated by compression and lateral spreading in subzone III-3, and a rapid radial spreading process in subzone III-4. The results of our study provided an improved understanding of the transport mechanisms of this rock avalanche. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Eelgrass (<i>Zostera marina</i>) and benthic habitat mapping in Atlantic Canada using high-resolution SPOT 6/7 satellite imagery
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the dominant perennial canopy-forming vegetation along the soft-sediment shores of the Northwest Atlantic. Eelgrass is considered an ecologically significant species in Atlantic Canada as it provides essential ecosystem functions and services and is an indicator of ecosystem health. Recent declines of eelgrass habitats highlight the need for methods quantifying the large-scale distribution of eelgrass throughout Atlantic Canada to monitor for further habitat loss. We used archived, high-resolution SPOT 6/7 satellite imagery to classify where vegetated habitats exist and if eelgrass was the dominant species. We focused on three bays in Nova Scotia: Port Mouton Bay, Port Joli Bay, and Jordan Bay. In 2015, field surveys were conducted to obtain training points, which were supplemented with visually identified points to perform a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood classifier. We also performed an unsupervised classification, where clustering algorithms were used to build training sites for a maximum likelihood classifier without using field survey data. These two pixel-based approaches provided similar results across the different images. Regardless of classification type (supervised versus unsupervised), we found different levels of success for the three bays. In Port Joli Bay, we were able to calculate where vegetated habitats occurred and what was the dominant species. This provided bay-wide distribution maps and suggested that 8.61-11.10% of the bay was covered by eelgrass. In Port Mouton Bay, we were able to calculate vegetation presence from absence, and eelgrass habitats were qualitatively differentiated from seaweed habitats by incorporating substrate data and local ecological knowledge. In contrast, benthic habitats could not be classified in Jordan Bay, highlighting the importance of sufficient water clarity for classifying satellite imagery. Our study has implications for the monitoring, conservation and management of eelgrass and other vegetated coastal habitats in Atlantic Canada by providing bay-wide distribution maps, and a classification framework which requires no field survey points for ground truthing.

TI  - An FBG-Based 2-DOF Force Sensing Intraocular Lens Positioning Hook for Cataract Surgery
T2  - IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is essential in cataract surgery. Intraocular lens positioning hook is used for position adjustment and accurate implantation of the IOL during the surgery. Effective force feedback of intraocular lens positioning hook can provide surgeons with imperceptible force information that will contribute to the accurate IOL implantation. Thus, accurate and effective force feedback is important for a hook. This letter presents an FBG based 2-DOF force sensing intraocular lens positioning hook for cataract surgery. In order to isolate the adhesive from human tissues, a layer of titanium coating has been plated on the adhesive surface through magnetron sputtering. The sensing performances of the hook have been tested. Calibration experiments demonstrate measurement sensitivities of 8.1 pm/mN and 7.4 pm/mN for F-x and F-y measurements, respectively. The linearities for Fx and Fy are 0.9997 and 0.9995, and the cross coupling on the F-x and F-y measurements are less than 0.8% full scale (F.S.) and 0.9% F.S., respectively. Moreover, the applicability of the proposed hook under steam sterilization environment has also been researched. The result indicates that the proposed hook can realize effective force feedback and valid isolation of the adhesive after repeated steam sterilization.

TI  - Spatiotemporal differentiation of the terrestrial gross primary production response to climate constraints in a dryland mountain ecosystem of northwestern China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring seasonal and interannual variability in gross primary production (GPP) and attributing these changes to climate change across various ecosystems helps to predict the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. However, such studies are scarce in dryland mountain ecosystems, possibly because of high spatial heterogeneity in landscapes and terrain. To better understand how carbon fluxes of the dryland mountain ecosystem respond to meteorology, we identified the trend and driving mechanism related to GPP in the Qilian Mountains (QLMs) of northwestern China from 2000 to 2016 by adopting the vegetation photosynthesis model that incorporates satellite and meteorological data. Our results revealed contrasting GPP trends in the growing season (May-September) between 2000-2010 and 2010-2016. In the later period, widespread GPP reductions were found across almost the whole area, especially at the middle and end of the growing season. In the central part of the QLMs, GPP reductions were induced by warming hiatus in contrast to drought in the western and eastern parts. Responses of GPP to temperature, precipitation and solar radiation differed in seasons and biomes. The positive effect of rising temperature that increased GPP was dominant during the growing season. The interannual variability in GPP was positively related to precipitation in June and July, but was negatively related to precipitation in other months. A positive correlation between forest GPP and solar radiation occurred in all months but July. Desert GPP responded negatively to solar radiation in all months but September. Temperature and solar radiation accounted for most of the interannual variability in forest GPP. Temperature was the major climate constraints on the interannual variability in grassland GPP. Precipitation and solar radiation primarily controlled the interannual variability in desert GPP from July to September, while temperature became more limited than precipitation and solar radiation for desert GPP in May and June.

TI  - On the opposite seasonality of MODIS AOD and surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> over the Northern China plain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Vertical Structure (AVS) retrieved from CALIOP was used to resolve contradictory seasonality between MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and surface PM2.5 over the Northern China Plain (NCP). CALIOP level 2 data was used to determine seasonally averaged day and night time AVS during 2011-2015 at wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm. Results showed that the AVS differed markedly between seasons. It was the most complex during summer days at 532 nm, when a nose like peak was apparent between 500 and 1000 m. This structure was attributed to strong aerosol hygroscopic growth, and accounted for approximately 40% of column AOD. The lowest section of AVS at 532 nm which is important for surface PM2.5 showed the highest during winter, an improved seasonality compared to column AOD; however, discrepancies were apparent during other seasons. Conversely, AVS at 1064 tun was virtually identical to observed PM2.5, implying that coarse particulates are more representative of PM2.5 in the NCP as compared to fine particulates. Thus, MODIS AOD at 550 nm may not be a good proxy for surface PM2.5 retrieval. Using CALIOP active detection, day and night time AOD were obtained, and showed that seasonality was more reasonable at night as compared to during the day. Comparisons of reconstructed daytime CALIOP AOD with MODIS AOD and AERONET AOD implied that winter AOD over the NCP was not as low as indicated by MODIS AOD.

TI  - Mapping daily evapotranspiration over a large irrigation district from MODIS data using a novel hybrid dual-source coupling model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for better understanding the availability and utilization of water resources. Over the past several decades, remote sensing (RS) technique has been widely applied to acquire indispensable input data for the estimation of ET at different spatial and temporal scales. Several dual-source ET models that can partition evaporation and transpiration have been developed by utilizing remote sensing data and ancillary meteorological observations. However, due to the significant spatial variability of air temperature over heterogeneous land surface, these models typically cannot be applied in heterogeneous regions with scarce meteorological observations. In the present study, a new model, referred to as the HTEM-ABL model, is developed by coupling the Hybrid dual-source scheme and Trapezoid framework-based ET Model (HTEM) with a simple atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model for ET estimation without ancillary air temperature observations. This model uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as the main input and is evaluated with field observations over a large irrigation district in North China. Results show that the HTEM-ABL model can be well applied to the study area, and the accuracy of HTEM-ABL model is slightly superior to the original HTEM model. The root mean square errors between the calculated and measured ET are 0.63 mm/day and 29.6 mm/year at the field scale and the regional scale, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated air temperature has been proved to be accurate qualitatively and quantitatively, and provides another aspect to evaluate the HTEM-ABL model. The spatial and temporal distributions of ET produced by the HTEM-ABL model are in good agreement with both the distribution of land use types and the variations of crop growth stages. In addition, the HTEM-ABL model shows less sensitivity to land surface temperature compared with the original HTEM model.

T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tc-99m-Rituximab is a new specific radiopharmaceutical that binds to the CD20 receptor which is highly expressed on the surface of B cells. We conducted a study in which Tc-99m-Rituximab was compared with filtered Tc-99m-sulfur colloid (fTcSC) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in patients with breast cancer.Method: The study is divided into three parts. 1. Initially, 25 patients were selected for an internal controlled trial to received both Tc-99m-Rituximab and fTcSC, the interval time is separated by >= 2 days. 2. Then, 91 patients were selected for a randomized controlled trial (41 and 50 patients in the Tc-99m-Rituximab and fTcSC groups, respectively). All patients were administered either agent at the 6- and 12-o' clock positions by subareolar injection technique. SLN mapping was then performed 2 h after injection. 3. Serial dynamic images were further acquired for 2 h in 31 patients (22 and 9 patients from 99mTc-Rituximab and fTcSC cohorts, respectively).Results: The identification rate of lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB in all and axilla regions for Tc-99m-Rituximab and Tc-99m-SC were 98.5% vs 98.7, 100% vs 98.4%, respectively. The mean number of SLNs identified by Tc-99m-Rituximab and fTcSC was respectively 2.72 and 3.28, with a significant difference of P = 0.013 (paired sample t-test). The difference exists in the internal mammary and clavicular area, not in the axillary. The mean number of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for Tc-99m-Rituximab and fTcSC was 2.95 vs 3.14, respectively, and no significant difference existed. Tc-99m-Rituximab also exhibited a significantly faster injection site clearance rate when compared with fTcSC (0.193 +/- 0.057 h(-1) vs 0.021 +/- 0.007 h(-1), respectively).Conclusion: No significant difference was observed in identification rate and number of axillary SLN imaging and SLNB, between the two tracers. Compared to fTcSC, Tc-99m-Rituximab based imaging demonstrated a fewer number of secondary lymph nodes and had faster injection site clearance rate.

TI  - Safety Assessment of Eurocode 3 Stability Design Rules for Prismatic Members in Bending and Compression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEEL STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the safety assessment of Eurocode 3-part 1-1 (Eurocode in EN 1993-1-1, Eurocode 3: design of steel structures-part 1-1: general rules and rules for buildings, CEN, Brussels, 2005) rules for hot-rolled members with I and H cross-sections loaded in bending and compression. The safety assessment follows the recommendations of Annex D of EN 1990 (Eurocode in EN 1990, Eurocode-basis of structural design, CEN, Brussels, 2002). It is based on a large number (11,345) of numerical simulations (GMNIA) covering various relevant parameters. The assessment aimed at the justification of the partial factors to be used in the design of members under bending and compression as part of the ongoing process of revision of Eurocode 3-part 1-1. For that, it covered the application of the interaction factors given in Annex B/Method 2 of the current version of Eurocode 3-part 1-1 which will be the only method in the future version of Eurocode 3. In addition, the interaction factors were applied with the new buckling curves for lateral-torsional buckling, as they will appear in the new version. The assessment showed consistent results across the subsets considered with low variability and partial factors generally lower than 1.0. Finally, the gamma(M)* values are compared for flexural buckling of columns, lateral-torsional buckling of beams with the results obtained for beam-columns considering f(y), cross-section geometry and E as random variables, using the same statistical characterization of the random variables. It is observed that the partial factors obtained beam-columns are lower than those obtained for columns and beams. In conclusion, based on combination of the results obtained it was possible to recommend a global value of gamma(M1) = 1.0.

TI  - The response of vegetation cover and dune activity to rainfall, drought and fire observed by multitemporal satellite imagery
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The stable longitudinal dunes in the northern Simpson Desert, Australia, were observed in satellite imagery to become more active after vegetation cover was reduced by fire and drought. Subsequent rainfall events also resulted in significant vegetation regrowth and dune stabilization. These switches between more active and stable conditions have not been previously described in the largely vegetated dune fields of central Australia. The observations, made on 12 dune sites, relied on high spatial resolution satellite imagery to observe dune crest activity, and seasonal Landsat fractional cover imagery to observe vegetation cover changes. The non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) component of the fractional vegetation cover images revealed significant changes in hummock grass cover on the dunes between 1988 and 2018, with a positive relationship with the three-year cumulative rainfall, disrupted by two periods of patchy burning. Only those sites that had burnt became active, and only after vegetation cover had remained low (NPV < 16%) during the 'Millennium Drought'. There is no threshold in vegetation cover, below which dune crests become active, but active dune features require four-years of low NPV cover (< 16%) to develop. The large rainfall event that ended the drought increased NPV cover, stabilizing the dunes. Similar hummock grass covered dunes are present across large areas of the arid zone, and are likely to respond in similar ways, given that fire and drought are common occurrences in Australia.

TI  - Toward utilizing multitemporal multispectral airborne laser scanning, Sentinel-2, and mobile laser scanning in map updating
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technologies provides interesting possibilities for the further development of nationwide mapping procedures that are currently based mainly on passive aerial images. In particular, we assume that there is a large undiscovered potential in multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) for topographic mapping. In this study, automated change detection from multitemporal multispectral ALS data was tested for the first time. The results showed that direct comparisons between height and intensity data from different dates reveal even small changes related to the development of a suburban area. A major challenge in future work is to link the changes with objects that are interesting in map production. In order to effectively utilize multisource remotely sensed data in mapping in the future, we also investigated the potential of satellite images and ground-based data to complement multispectral ALS. A method for continuous change monitoring from a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images was developed and tested. Finally, a high-density point cloud was acquired with terrestrial mobile laser scanning and automatically classified into four classes. The results were compared with the ALS data, and the possible roles of the different data sources in a future map updating process were discussed. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Comparing level-2 and level-3 satellite ocean color retrieval validation methodologies
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ocean color data applications leverage global spatially composited level-3 (L3) satellite data because of their regular Earth-grid frame of reference. However, ocean color satellite retrieval performance is routinely evaluated on level-2 (L2) data at the native satellite swath resolution and geometries. This study assesses how accurately binned and gridded L3 data represent L2 satellite data products via satellite-to-in situ match-up activities. L2 and L3 satellite data retrievals of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll-a are compared with a common in situ dataset, revealing similar L2 and L3 satellite-to-in situ performance for both MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP. This agreement implies that L2 validation results are generally applicable to L3 data. However, uncertainties are introduced during the generation of L3 data from L2 data. L3 data comparisons introduce a wider temporal window between the time of in situ measurement and the time of the satellite observation, which can unintentionally reflect on the quality of the satellite retrieval or algorithm performance. The choice of L3 map projection may introduce additional uncertainty by spatially distorting the true location of the satellite retrievals. Each manipulation of satellite data beyond the instrument's native spatiotemporal reference (L2) reduces the applicability of L2 validation results to higher data processing levels.

TI  - New algorithm for computation of the Rayleigh-scattering radiance for remote sensing of water color from space
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rayleigh-scattering radiance (L-r) calculations based on the standard algorithm are often associated with significant uncertainties leading to inconsistent water-leaving radiance retrievals, both spatially and temporally across latitudes and altitudes. The uncertainty could result from the use of Rayleigh lookup tables generated for the standard surface atmospheric pressure and hence the Rayleigh optical thickness (ROT) at the specific atmospheric pressure regardless of its daily and seasonal variations. This study presents a new algorithm (hereafter referred to as the refined algorithm) to compute the Rayleigh-scattering radiance that relies on accurate calculations of the ROT as a function of the composition of air (CO2 volume concentration), surface atmospheric pressure and relative air mass for given sun-sensor geometries. As CO2 is well mixed throughout the atmospheric column, the CO2 volume concentrations derived from this study agree well with measurements in different seasons across studied latitudes. Relative air mass has a significant effect on the ROT and that is calculated as a function of apparent sun-sensor zenith angles with the variations in pressure and thermal characteristics of the atmosphere. Thus, the results indicate significant variations of ROT and air mass with location on the earth's surface and their influence on the L-r, particularly in the UV-Blue region of the spectrum. The refined algorithm for calculating the L-r is tested on several MODIS-Aqua Level 1A data and the relative errors in Rayleigh-scattering radiance and normalized water-leaving radiance (Lwn) retrievals between the refined algorithm and standard (SeaDAS) algorithm are compared using in-situ measurement data collected at MOBY (clear ocean), AERONET (turbid coastal ocean), and NOMAD (clear ocean) sites. The results indicate that the L-r calculated using the SeaDAS algorithm are mostly underestimated and show significant departures with the L-r calculated using the refined algorithm. This departure induced by the SeaDAS algorithm to L-r becomes larger with decreasing wavelength (Delta L-r from -2.38% at 412 nm to 1.69% at 678nm), which causes errors in Lwn retrievals (Delta Lwn) of up to 26.48% at 412 nm and 13.34% at 678 nm. The overall improvements in the retrieved Lwn values achieved vary from 56% at 412 nm to 29% at 678 nm, which yield similar improvements in Lwn retrievals with lower errors and higher slopes and correlation coefficients when compared with the in-situ Lwn data. These results indicate that the refined algorithm for computation of the L-r can yield more accurate Lwn retrievals and produce spatially and temporally consistent biogeochemical products at different latitudes and altitudes as desired by the scientific community.

TI  - Impact of synthetic space-borne NO<sub>2</sub> observations from the Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5P missions on tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> analyses
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) dedicated to the evaluation of the added value of the Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5P missions for tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Sentinel-4 is a geostationary (GEO) mission covering the European continent, providing observations with high temporal resolution (hourly). Sentinel-5P is a low Earth orbit (LEO) mission providing daily observations with a global coverage. The OSSE experiment has been carefully designed, with separate models for the simulation of observations and for the assimilation experiments and with conservative estimates of the total observation uncertainties. In the experiment we simulate Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 columns and surface ozone concentrations at 7 by 7 km resolution over Europe for two 3-month summer and winter periods. The synthetic observations are based on a nature run (NR) from a chemistry transport model (MOCAGE) and error estimates using instrument characteristics. We assimilate the simulated observations into a chemistry transport model (LOTOS-EUROS) independent of the NR to evaluate their impact on modelled NO2 tropospheric columns and surface concentrations. The results are compared to an operational system where only ground-based ozone observations are ingested. Both instruments have an added value to analysed NO2 columns and surface values, reflected in decreased biases and improved correlations. The Sentinel-4 NO2 observations with hourly temporal resolution benefit modelled NO2 analyses throughout the entire day where the daily Sentinel-5P NO2 observations have a slightly lower impact that lasts up to 3-6 h after overpass. The evaluated benefits may be even higher in reality as the applied error estimates were shown to be higher than actual errors in the now operational Sentinel-5P NO2 products. We show that an accurate representation of the NO2 profile is crucial for the benefit of the column observations on surface values. The results support the need for having a combination of GEO and LEO missions for NO2 analyses in view of the complementary benefits of hourly temporal resolution (GEO, Sentinel-4) and global coverage (LEO, Sentinel-5P).

AB  - The characteristics of local thundersnow at fine spatiotemporal scale on 9 and 10 November 2009 in Beijing were analyzed, using wind profiler, microwave radiometer, automatic weather station, Doppler weather radar, and satellite data. Furthermore, the causes of winter convection are discussed. The results showed that it was reflux weather. The cause of the thunder and lightning was the elevated convection above the lower cold and dry air, and the trigger for convection was the short wave trough and convergencein the middle level. This thundersnow event developed from monsoon-like long-lasting water vapor transport at 850 hPa from the South China Sea along with strong instability of, and convergence in, the conveyor layer.

TI  - Large-Truck Safety Warning System Based on Lightweight SSD Model
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transportation is an important link in the mining process, and large trucks are one of the important tools for mine transportation. Due to their large size and small driving position, large trucks have a blind spot, which is a hidden danger to the safe transportation of mines and has a great impact on production efficiency and economic loss. The traditional large truck safety warning system mainly uses the ultrasonic short-distance ranging method, radar ranging method, GPS (Global Positioning System) technology, and so on. The disadvantage of these methods is that they are affected by the environment and weather, and they cannot display the object status in real time. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to realize the large truck safety warning system based on machine vision. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model and an atrous convolution to build a large-truck object recognition model. First, the training images are collected and marked. Then, the object recognition model is established by using the lightweight SSD model. The atrous convolutional layer is introduced to improve small object detection accuracy. In the end, the objectness prior method is used to improve the classification speed. Experimental results show that, compared with the original SSD model, the lightweight SSD model occupies less space and runs faster. The lightweight SSD model with the atrous convolutional layer is more sensitive to small objects and improves detection accuracy. The objectness prior method further improves the identification speed. Compared with the traditional large truck safety warning, the system is not affected by the environment and realizes the visualization of large truck safety warning.

TI  - Assessing spatial and temporal patterns of canopy decline across a diverse montane landscape in the Klamath Mountains, CA, USA using a 30-year Landsat time series
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Tree mortality is of considerable concern, but the magnitude and extent of forest canopy decline are relatively unknown in landscapes with high levels of topographic complexity, spatial heterogeneity, and species diversity. We assessed 30 years of canopy decline, including a 5-year period characterized by extreme drought, in one of North America's most diverse landscapes in the Klamath Mountains of northern California, USA. Objectives (1) Characterize tree mortality by species, (2) Quantify temporal and spatial patterns of remotely-sensed canopy decline in relation to climate, (3) Compare canopy decline among vegetation types, topographic settings, and stand structural classes during drought. Methods We characterized tree mortality by species with field data and quantified the role of climate on canopy decline with a 30-year Landsat time series. We assessed and compared the role of topography and stand structure on canopy decline during drought. Results Most tree mortality and canopy decline occurred at higher elevations in Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis) and subalpine forests. Annual area of canopy decline was positively correlated with summer temperature and minimum vapor pressure deficit but not precipitation. The area of canopy decline was three times greater during the drought. The magnitude of decline was greatest at higher elevations, on more exposed, southwestern slopes, and in stands with old-growth structure. Stands in valleys and low slopes experienced relatively little decline. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the vulnerability of high elevation, old-growth forests to increasing temperature and suggests the potential for refugia from drought in diverse, heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Computer vision-based framework for extracting tectonic lineaments from optical remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of tectonic lineaments from digital satellite data is a fundamental application in remote sensing. The location of tectonic lineaments such as faults and dykes are of interest for a range of applications, particularly because of their association with hydrothermal mineralization. Although a wide range of applications have utilized computer vision techniques, a standard workflow for application of these techniques to tectonic lineament extraction is lacking. We present a framework for extracting tectonic lineaments using computer vision techniques. The proposed framework is a combination of edge detection and line extraction algorithms for extracting tectonic lineaments using optical remote sensing data. It features ancillary computer vision techniques for reducing data dimensionality, removing noise and enhancing the expression of lineaments. The efficiency of two convolutional filters are compared in terms of enhancing the lineaments. We test the proposed framework on Landsat 8 data of a mineral-rich portion of the Gascoyne Province in Western Australia. To validate the results, the extracted lineaments are compared to geologically mapped structures by the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). The results show that the best correlation between our extracted tectonic lineaments and the GSWA tectonic lineament map is achieved by applying a minimum noise fraction transformation and a Laplacian filter. Application of a directional filter shows a strong correlation with known sites of hydrothermal mineralization. Hence, our method using either filter can be used for mineral prospectivity mapping in other regions where faults are exposed and observable in optical remote sensing data.

TI  - Implementing a Ricoeurian lens to examine the impact of individuals? worldviews on subject content knowledge in RE in England: a theoretical proposition
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article recognises that for increasing numbers of teachers with no faith, religion may seem alien, and this may impact their choice of subject content knowledge. Teachers may, subconsciously, choose to teach aspects of religion(s) and non-religious worldviews which adhere to their own worldviews but ignore aspects with which they disagree. This theoretical article aims to examine the relationality between teachers? personal worldviews and their choice of subject content knowledge for inclusion into their RE teaching. Current literature on worldviews and RE, alongside research into teachers? professional knowledge, is examined to investigate this relationality. Implementing a Ricoeurian lens provides theoretical insight into the relationality between teachers? personal worldviews and their professional knowledge, in particular, their subject content knowledge. For teachers lack of subject content knowledge may be viewed as an insurmountable problem for effective RE teaching. Yet what constitutes teachers? professional knowledge itself is questionable as is the relationality between personal worldviews and choice of subject content knowledge. This article recommends the provision of support for teachers to become worldview conscious to illuminate these (un)conscious omissions of religion(s) and non-religious worldviews and challenge any unexamined bias.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Magnetometer-Guided Sentinel Lymphadenectomy After Intraprostatic Injection of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles in Intermediate- and High-Risk Prostate Cancer Using the Magnetic Activity of Sentinel Nodes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the high morbidity of extended lymph node dissection (eLND) and the low detection rate of limited lymph node dissection (LND), targeted sentinel lymph node dissection (sLND) was implemented in prostate cancer (PCa). Subsequently, nonradioactive sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a magnetometer after intraprostatic injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) was successfully applied in PCa. To validate the reliability of this approach, considering the magnetic activity of SLNs or whether it is sufficient to dissect only the most active SLNs as shown in other tumor entities for radio-guided sLND, we analyzed magnetometer-guided sLND results in 218 high- and intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing eLND as a reference standard. Using a sentinel nomogram to predict lymph node invasion (LNI), a risk range was determined up to which LND could be dispensed with or sLND only would be adequate. In total, 3,711 LNs were dissected, and 1,779 SLNs (median, 8) were identified. Among 78 LN-positive patients, there were 264 LN metastases (median, 2). sLND had a 96.79% diagnostic rate, 88.16% sensitivity, 98.59% specificity, 97.1% positive predictive value (PPV), 93.96% negative predictive value (NPV), 4.13% false-negative rate, and 0.92% additional diagnostic value (LN metastases only outside the eLND template). For intermediate-risk patients only, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 100%. Magnetic activities of SLNs were heterogeneous regardless of metastasis. The accuracy of predicting the presence of metastases for each LN from the proportion of activity was only 57.3% in high- and 65% in intermediate-risk patients. Patients with LNI risk of less than 5% could have been spared LND, as no positive LNs were found in this group. For patients with an LNI risk between 5% and 20%, sLNDonly would have been sufficient to detect almost all LN metastases; thus, eLND could be dispensed with in 36% of patients. In conclusion, SPION-guided sLND is a reliable alternative to eLND in intermediate-/high-risk PCa. No conclusions can be drawn from magnetic SLN activity regarding the presence of metastases. LND could be dispensed with according to a nomogram of predicted probability for LNI of 5% without losing any LN-positive patient. Patients with LNI risk between 5% and 20% could be spared eLND by performing sLND.

TI  - Heterogeneous Responses of Axillary Lymph Node Metastases to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy are Common and Depend on Breast Cancer Subtype
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The objective of this study was to analyze heterogeneous responses of axillary lymph node metastasis to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to determine to what extent they differ between tumor subtypes (TN, HER2+, HR+/HER2-). Methods This retrospective, monocenter study included 72 consecutive, histologically node-positive breast cancers (cT1-4 cN1-3 cM0) diagnosed in the period from January 2015 to December 2016, who had received axillary lymph node dissection following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All individual lymph node specimens were re-evaluated for the presence of tumor cells and chemotherapy effects to assess their response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on an individual lymph node level according to the Sataloff classification. Results Heterogeneous axillary responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy occurred in 47.2% of the included 72 patients. The partial response rate was significantly higher in HR+/HER2- tumors (74.2%) than in TN (28.6%) and HER2+ tumors (25.0%) (p < 0.001). The presence of at least one negative, completely responding lymph node in the axillary lymph node dissection specimen had a false-negative rate of 48.8% in predicting ypN0. It dropped below 10% if at least four completely responding negative lymph nodes were identified. Conclusions Our study shows that axillary heterogeneous response rates differ significantly between tumor subtypes.

TI  - Snow depth variability in the Northern Hemisphere mountains observed from space
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate snow depth observations are critical to assess water resources. More than a billion people rely on water from snow, most of which originates in the Northern Hemisphere mountain ranges. Yet, remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking at the large scale. Here, we show the ability of Sentinel-1 to map snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere mountains at 1 km(2) resolution using an empirical change detection approach. An evaluation with measurements from similar to 4000 sites and reanalysis data demonstrates that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences. This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Ultrasound Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Biopsy-Proven Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Results from the SN FNAC Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (SN FNAC) study has shown that in node-positive (N+) breast cancer, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) can be performed following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), with a low false negative rate (FNR = 8.4%). A secondary endpoint of the SN FNAC study was to determine whether axillary ultrasound (AxUS) could predict axillary pathological complete response (ypN0) and increase the accuracy of SNB. Methods The SN FNAC trial is a study of patients with biopsy-proven N+ breast cancer who underwent SNB followed by completion node dissection. All patients had AxUS following NAC and the axillary nodes were classified as either positive (AxUS+) or negative (AxUS-). AxUS was compared with the final axillary pathology results. Results There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics of patients with AxUS+ versus those with AxUS-. Overall, 82.5% (47/57) of AxUS+ patients had residual positive lymph nodes (ypN+) at surgery and 53.8% (42/78) of AxUS- patients had ypN+. Post NAC AxUS sensitivity was 52.8%, specificity 78.3%, and negative predictive value 46.2%. AxUS FNR was 47.2%, versus 8.4% for SNB. If post-NAC AxUS- was used to select patients for SNB, FNR would decrease from 8.4 to 2.7%. However, using post-NAC AxUS in addition to SNB as an indication for ALND would have led to unnecessary ALND in 7.8% of all patients. Conclusion AxUS is not appropriate as a standalone staging procedure, and SNB itself is sufficient to assess the axilla post NAC in patients who present with N+ breast cancer.

TI  - Trends in Regional Nodal Management of Breast Cancer Patients with Low Nodal Burden
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 confirms the safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in breast cancer patients with one to two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), without compromising disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In contrast, the NCIC MA20 trial showed improved DFS in node-positive patients undergoing ALND and RNI. We sought to examine how these data have influenced the management of patients with limited nodal burden. Methods Using the National Cancer Database, patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 and who met the criteria for Z0011 were identified. Logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with practice patterns. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of ALND and RNI with OS. Results Omission of ALND in Z0011-eligible patients reached 89.2% in 2015. This Z0011-compliant group was more likely to undergo RNI compared with the non-compliant group (36.4% vs. 31.3%; p < 0.05), with RNI increasing to 43.8% by 2015. Factors associated with the use of RNI included later year of diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-2.1], hormone receptor-negative tumor (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4), grade 3 tumor (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3), treatment at a non-academic site (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3) and two versus one positive SLN (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.2). With 43 months median follow-up, RNI was not associated with improved OS. Conclusion Since the publication of Z0011, the omission of ALND has become widespread; however nearly half of these women now receive RNI. The optimal radiation therapy approach for this low nodal burden population warrants further study.

TI  - Multi-scale RoIs selection for classifying multi-spectral images
T2  - MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of object-based image analysis (OBIA) in remote sensing studies have received a considerable amount of attention over the recent decade due to dramatically increasing of the spatial resolution of satellite imaging sensors for earth observation. In this study, an unsupervised methodology based on OBIA paradigm for the estimation of multi-scale training sets for land cover classification is proposed. The proposed method consists of selection of valid region of interests in an unsupervised way and its characterization using some attributes in order to form meaningful and reliable training sets for supervised classification of different land covers of a satellite image. Multi-scale image segmentation is a prerequisite step for estimation of multi-scale training sets. However, scale selection remains a challenge in multi-scale segmentation. In this work, we propose a method to determine the appropriate segmentation scale for each land cover with the help of prior knowledge in the form of in-situ data. The proposed method is further discussed and validated through multi-scale segmentation using quick shift and random forest algorithms on two multi-spectral images captured using Worldview-2 sensor. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms three state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Optimal season for discriminating C3 and C4 grass functional types using multi-date Sentinel 2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of remote sensing systems to optimally discriminate and map C3 and C4 grass species varies over time, due to environmental changes, which influence their phenological, physiological and morphological characteristics. In this regard, the discrimination of C3 and C4 grasses is insufficient when using a single image acquired at a specific period. In this study, multi-date Sentinel 2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) data were explored to determine the optimal period for classifying and mapping Festuca costata, C3 and Themeda Triandra, C4 grasses in the montane grasslands of South Africa. The study further assessed how seasonal variations in species classification can be explained by climatic variability (rainfall and temperature). Results showed that image acquisition dates influence the discrimination accuracy, spatial representation of the two grass species, as well as the performance of spectral bands. The winter period also presents a better temporal window for discriminating C3 and C4 target grass species, with higher overall classification accuracies (between 91.8% and 95.3%), than summer (between 81.4% and 90.3%). Lower omission (between 2.8% and 11.6%) and commission (between 2.5% and 14.2%) errors were also observed when discriminating using winter images, as compared to those acquired in summer. Summer images showed large grass species areal coverage (e.g. in November and March, C3 and C4 covered ?25%), whereas in winter (mainly August), a notable decrease was observed. Overall, findings of the study have demonstrated the relevance of multi-date Sentinel data in discriminating C3 and C4 grass species. There is, however, a need to explore the classification ability of Sentinel 2 derivatives, especially during early summer and winter fall.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy and lymph node dissection in the era of new systemic therapies for malignant melanoma
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recently, adjuvant therapies with checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors have become available for patients with malignant melanoma and microscopic nodal disease. Meanwhile the number of complete nodal dissections for a melanoma-positive sentinel node (SN) have decreased significantly. Objective The authors discuss the significance of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and early lymph node dissection in the era of adjuvant systemic therapy for stage III melanoma. Materials and methods Current publications and recommendations were evaluated. Results Complete nodal dissection for a positive SN significantly reduces the risk of regional nodal relapse. However, neither SNB nor complete nodal dissection following a positive SN are associated with a benefit in survival. With the availability of novel adjuvant systemic treatment strategies for stage III melanoma, SNB has become an even more important part of modern staging diagnostics. Thus, detection of early dissemination of melanoma cells into the SN as well as the quantification of the tumor load are decisive for further therapy planning. Conclusion Accurate assessment of the regional lymph node status by SNB is becoming even more important in the era of novel effective adjuvant therapies for microscopic nodal disease. Whether complete lymph node dissection is performed in patients with a positive SN needs to be assessed individually. In the case of "active nodal surveillance" instead of surgery, long-term close follow-up in specialized centers, including ultrasonographic controls, is required.

TI  - Potential of multispectral reflectance for assessment of snow geophysical parameters in Solang valley in the lower Indian Himalayas
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow geophysical parameters such as wetness, density and permittivity are a significant input in hydrological models and water resource management. In this paper, we utilize the triangle method based on a feature space developed with the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and the Normalized Differenced Snow Index (NDSI) for the estimation of surface snow wetness, permittivity and density. The triangular feature space based on NIR reflectance and NDSI is parameterized to yield a linear relationship between the snow wetness and the NIR reflectance. Snow density and permittivity are derived based on the least squares solution of empirical relations based on the observations of surface snow wetness. The proposed methodology was evaluated using Sentinel-2 data, and the modeled snow geophysical parameters were validated with respect to field measurements. Based on the results, it was inferred that the NIR reflectance varies linearly with the liquid water content in the snow. A good agreement was determined between the modeled and measured parameters for wet snow conditions as observed by the coefficient of determination of 0.968, 0.521 and 0.969 for the snow wetness, density and permittivity (real part), respectively. The proposed approach can be significantly utilized with unmanned aerial sensors for monitoring of physical properties of fresh or wet snow and is thus expected to contribute considerably in hydrological applications and avalanche studies.

TI  - A low-cost monitor for simultaneous measurement of fine particulate matter and aerosol optical depth - Part 1: Specifications and testing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution is a leading contributor to death, disease, and environmental degradation. Satellite-based measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) are used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations across the world, but the relationship between satellite-estimated AOD and ground-level PM2.5 is uncertain. Sun photometers measure AOD from the Earth's surface and are often used to improve satellite data; however, reference-grade photometers and PM2.5 monitors are expensive and rarely co-located. This work presents the development and validation of the aerosol mass and optical depth (AMOD) sampler, an inexpensive and compact device that simultaneously measures PM2.5 mass and AOD. The AMOD utilizes a low-cost light-scattering sensor in combination with a gravimetric filter measurement to quantify ground-level PM2.5. Aerosol optical depth is measured using optically filtered photodiodes at four discrete wavelengths. Field validation studies revealed agreement within 10% for AOD values measured between co-located AMOD and AErosol RObotics NETwork (AERONET) monitors and for PM2.5 mass measured between co-located AMOD and EPA Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) monitors. These results demonstrate that the AMOD can quantify AOD and PM2.5 accurately at a fraction of the cost of existing reference monitors.

T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This preliminary study aimed to examine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) vs. indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG), combined with blue dye in patients with breast cancer. Methods This was a retrospective study of consecutive female patients with invasive stage I-III (based on pre-operative physical examination and imaging) primary breast cancer at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 01/2013 and 01/2015 who underwent preoperative SLNB by ICG + blue dye or CEUS + blue dye. The numbers of detected SLNs, detection rates, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared between the two groups. Results A total of 443 patients were included. The detection rates of SLNs in the CEUS + blue dye and ICG + blue dye groups were 98.4 and 98.1%, respectively (P = 0.814). The average numbers of SLNs detected per patient showed no significant difference between the two groups (3.06 +/- 1.33 and 3.12 +/- 1.31 in the CEUS + blue dye and ICG + blue dye groups, respectively; P = 0.659). After a median follow-up of 46 months, five patients in the CEUS + blue dye group and 15 in the ICG + blue dye group had recurrence. RFS rates showed no significant difference (P = 0.55). Conclusion This preliminary study suggests that CEUS + blue dye and ICG + blue dye are both feasible for SLN detection in breast cancer.

TI  - Sleeping sickness in the historical focus of forested Guinea: update using a geographically based method
T2  - PARASITE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, 1447 new cases of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) were reported, which reflects considerable progress towards the World Health Organisation's target of eliminating HAT as a public health problem by 2020. However, current epidemiological data are still lacking for a number of areas, including historical HAT foci. In order to update the HAT situation in the historical focus of forested Guinea, we implemented a geographically based methodology: Identification of Villages at Risk (IVR). The methodology is based on three sequential steps: Desk-based IVR (IVR-D), which selects villages at risk of HAT on the basis of HAT archives and geographical items; Field-based IVR (IVR-F), which consists in collecting additional epidemiological and geographical information in the field in villages at risk; and to be Medically surveyed IVR (IVR-M), a field data analysis through a Geographic Information System (GIS), to compile a list of the villages most at risk of HAT, suitable to guide active screening and passive surveillance. In an area of 2385 km(2) with 1420,530 inhabitants distributed in 1884 settlements, 14 villages with a population of 11,236 inhabitants were identified as most at risk of HAT and selected for active screening. Although no HAT cases could be confirmed, subjects that had come into contact with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense were identified and two sentinel sites were chosen to implement passive surveillance. IVR, which could be applied to any gambiense areas where the situation needs to be clarified, could help to reach the objective of HAT elimination.

TI  - A nomogram to predict node positivity in patients with thin melanomas helps inform shared patient decision making
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To develop a nomogram to estimate the probability of positive sentinel lymph node (+SLN) for patients with thin melanoma and to characterize its potential impact on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) rates. Methods Patients diagnosed with thin (0.5-1.0 mm) melanoma were identified from the National Cancer Database 2012 to 2015. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with +SLN, and a nomogram to predict +SLN was constructed. Nomogram performance was evaluated and diagnostic test statistics were calculated. Results Of the 21 971 patients included 10 108 (46.0%) underwent SLNB, with a 4.0% +SLN rate. On multivariable analysis, age, Breslow thickness, lymphovascular invasion, ulceration, and Clark level were significantly associated with SLN status. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.70). While 15 249 (69.4%) patients had either T1b tumors or T1a tumors with at least one adverse feature, only 2846 (13.0%) had a nomogram predicted probability of a +SLN >= 5%. Using this cut-off, the indication for a SLNB in these patients would be reduced by 81.3% as compared to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition staging criteria. Conclusions The risk predictions obtained from the nomogram allow for more accurate selection of patients who could benefit from SLNB.

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To examine the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5) combined with indoor air pollution and handgrip strength among people aged 50 and over. Methods: Data were from the first wave of World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health in China. Ambient annual concentration of PM(2.5) was estimated by using the satellite data we also investigated the use of fuels and chimneys as indoor air pollution. A two-level (individual level and community level) linear model was applied to examine the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5) combined with indoor air pollution and the handgrip strength. Results: A total of 13 175 individuals aged 50 years and over were included for analysis. The handgrip strength was (26.67±0.54) kg. Ambient PM(2.5) was found to be significantly associated with the risk of decreased handgrip strength. Outdoor PM(2.5) concentration was negatively correlated with handgrip strength (beta=-0.23, 95%CI: -0.31 - -0.14) decrease in handgrip strength after adjusting for gender, age, residence, education, household assets, intake of vegetables and fruits, smoking and drinking, physical activity. In rural area, compared to those who used solid fuel, use of clean fuel increased (beta=1.41, 95%CI: 0.36-2.46) handgrip strength. But in urban area, we did not find any statistically significant association between the use of clean fuel and handgrip strength (beta=0.19, 95%CI: -0.95-1.32). Conclusion: This study found that long-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5) combined with indoor air pollution was significantly associated with low handgrip strength among people aged 50 years and over, this suggested that ambient PM(2.5) might serve as one of the risk factors for low physical function seen in the people aged 50 years and over.
AB  - 目的： 分析室内、外空气污染与≥50岁人群手握力的关联。 方法： 采用WHO全球老龄化与成人健康研究中国项目第一轮基线调查，室外空气污染以PM(2.5)平均浓度（基于卫星遥感数据进行估计）进行描述，室内空气污染通过燃料和烟囱使用情况进行描述，采用两水平（个体层面和社区层面）线性模型分析室内、外空气污染与中国≥50岁人群手握力的关系。 结果： 共纳入13 175名≥50岁中老年人。手握力为（26.67±0.54）kg。调整性别、年龄、居住地区、文化程度、家庭经济水平、水果蔬菜摄入状况、吸烟、饮酒和体力活动后，室外PM(2.5)浓度与手握力呈负相关（beta=-0.23，95%CI：-0.31~-0.14）。在农村，相比使用固体燃料（非清洁），使用清洁燃料可以提高手握力值（beta=1.41，95%CI：0.36~2.46）。但在城市地区，未发现使用清洁燃料对手握力值有显著影响（beta=0.19，95%CI：-0.95~1.32）。 结论： 室外PM(2.5)与室内污染合并暴露与≥50岁人群低手握力显著相关，提示了慢性长期空气污染暴露有可能是我国中老年人较低机体功能的重要危险因素之一。.

TI  - Trends and health impacts of major urban air pollutants in Kazakhstan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality in Kazakhstan cities has been poorly investigated despite their deteriorating situations. This study evaluates the national air pollution monitoring network data (PM10, NO2, SO2, and O-3) in Kazakhstan cities, and provides the estimates of excess mortality rates associated with PM2.5 exposure using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) concentration-response function. Morbidity rates associated with PM10 exposure were also estimated. Firstly, an air quality-based priority ranking of the cities was suggested based on the annual concentrations of the pollutants during the period of 3 years between 2015 and 2017. Nur-Sultan, Almaty, Ust-Kamenogorsk, and Aktobe were identified as the most polluted cities by PM10, NO2, SO2, and O-3 respectively. Then, the exposure-response assessment was conducted for 21 cities. In major cities of Kazakhstan attributable to ambient air pollution per capita, mortality rate is 1 193 per 100 000 population per year, which is 8.97 times higher than in Europe. It is estimated that fine particulate matter exposure in the major cities of Kazakhstan causes 101 139 premature deaths annually. This study provides quantitative information on potential public health risks and impacts of air pollution, which is valuable for decision-makers to justify national environmental policies. Implications: Quantitative information on health impacts from air pollution can be useful for decision makers in Kazakhstan to justify environmental policies and identify policy and funding priorities for tackling air pollution issues. It can be also useful for policy makers in improving the quality of government funded environmental reports and strategic documents as they have many shortcomings in terms of selection of air quality indicators, identification of priority pollutants, identification of sources of pollution. This study has high significance due to the lack of data and knowledge in the region of Central Asia, in particular, of Kazakhstan.

TI  - Investigation of CATS aerosol products and application toward global diurnal variation of aerosols
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comparison of 1064 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol extinction profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) level 2 aerosol product with collocated Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD, Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra Dark Target AOD and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) AOD and extinction data for the period of March 2015- October 2017. Upon quality-assurance checks of CATS data, reasonable agreement is found between aerosol data from CATS and other sensors. Using quality-assured CATS aerosol data, for the first time, variations in AODs and aerosol extinction profiles are evaluated at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 UTC (and/or 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 local time or LT) on both regional and global scales. This study suggests that marginal variations are found in AOD from a global mean perspective, with the minimum aerosol extinction values found at 18:00 LT near the surface layer for global oceans, for both the June-November and December- May seasons. Over land, below 500 m, the daily minimum and maximum aerosol extinction values are found at 12:00 and 00:00/06:00LT, respectively. Strong diurnal variations are also found over north Africa, the Middle East and India for the December-May season, and over north Africa, south Africa, the Middle East and India for the June-November season.

TI  - Applicability of MODIS C061 Aerosol Optical Depth Products in Xi'an Region
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depths (AODs) arc calculated for the Xi'an region based on the observation data of a sky radiometer (POM-02) and Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law. These AODs arc used as true values to compare with three inversion algorithms' results of AODs in the MODIS C061 product of NASA Terra satellite, and the accuracies and applicability of those three inversion algorithms for the Xi' an region arc discussed. Furthermore, we statistically analyze the spatial distributions and seasonal variation characteristics of AODs for the Xi' an region and its surrounding region using MODIS aerosol products. The results indicate the following: there is the best relationship between the AODs inverted from the MODIS DT&DB product and POM-02 data among those three MODIS inversion algorithms of Terra satellite, and its correlation coefficient is approximately 0.92. Thus, the MODIS DT&DB product is the most appropriate product for studying climate change and air pollution in the Xi'an region. Dust storms and human activities arc the main sources of aerosols in the Guanzhong Plain. The AODs arc greater in the eastern part and less in the western part of Guanzhong Plain, and the high-value centers arc mainly distributed in the regions such as Xi' an, Xianyang, and Weinan. The AODs in the Xi' an and Xianyang regions reach their maximum and minimums in the spring and autumn, respectively. However, the AODs from other regions in the Guanzhong Plain show apparently seasonal variation characteristics with greater values in spring and summer and lower values in autumn and winter.

TI  - Incorporation of inline warm rain diagnostics into the COSP2 satellite simulator for process-oriented model evaluation
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observational Simulator Package (COSP) is used to diagnose model performance and physical processes via an apple-to-apple comparison to satellite measurements. Although the COSP provides useful information about clouds and their climatic impact, outputs that have a subcolumn dimension require large amounts of data. This can cause a bottleneck when conducting sets of sensitivity experiments or multiple model intercomparisons. Here, we incorporate two diagnostics for warm rain microphysical processes into the latest version of the simulator (COSP2). The first one is the occurrence frequency of warm rain regimes (i.e., non-precipitating, drizzling, and precipitating) classified according to CloudSat radar reflectivity, putting the warm rain process diagnostics into the context of the geographical distributions of precipitation. The second diagnostic is the probability density function of radar reflectivity profiles normalized by the in-cloud optical depth, the so-called contoured frequency by optical depth diagram (CFODD), which illustrates how the warm rain processes occur in the vertical dimension using statistics constructed from CloudSat and MODIS simulators. The new diagnostics are designed to produce statistics online along with subcolumn information during the COSP execution, eliminating the need to output subcolumn variables. Users can also readily conduct regional analysis tailored to their particular research interest (e.g., land-ocean differences) using an auxiliary post-process package after the COSP calculation. The inline diagnostics are applied to the MIROC6 general circulation model (GCM) to demonstrate how known biases common among multiple GCMs relative to satellite observations are revealed. The inline multi-sensor diagnostics are intended to serve as a tool that facilitates process-oriented model evaluations in a manner that reduces the burden on modelers for their diagnostics effort.

TI  - Interaction between curvature-driven width oscillations and channel curvature in evolving meander bends
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the morphodynamics of channel width oscillations associated with the planform development of river meander bends. With this aim we develop a novel planform evolution model, based on the framework of the classical bend theory of river meanders by Ikeda et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 112, 1981), that accounts for local width changes over space and time, tied to the local hydro-morphodynamics through a two-way feedback process. We focus our attention on 'autogenic' width variations, which are forced by flow nonlinearities driven by channel curvature dynamics. Under the assumption of regular, sinusoidal width and curvature oscillations, we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations, formally identical to those presented by Seminara et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 438, 2001, pp. 213-230), with an additional equation for the longitudinal oscillation of the channel width. The proposed approach gives insight into the interaction between autogenic width variations and curvature in meander development and between forcing and damping effects in the formation of width variations. Model outcomes suggest that autogenic width oscillations mainly determine wider-at-inflection meandering river patterns, and affect their planform development particularly at super-resonant aspect ratios, where the width oscillation reaches its maximum and reduces meander sinuosity and lateral floodplain size. The coevolution of autogenic width oscillation and curvature occurs through temporal hysteresis cycles, whereby the peak in channel curvature lags behind that of width oscillation. Width oscillation amplitudes predicted by the model are consistent with those extracted from remotely sensed data.

AB  - In archaeological research about feeding modes of past societies, different interests and methodologies have been developed. In their search for knowledge about Mayan foods and cooking methods, scholars such as Herrera Flores and Gtz [2014. La alimentacin de los antiguos mayas de la Pennsula de Yucatn: Consideraciones sobre la identidad y la cuisine en la poca prehispnica. Estudios de Cultura Maya 43 (43): 6998. doi:10.1016/S0185-2574(14)70325-9] have paid attention to available resources, diet, and cuisine. Food is more than food intake, as it also relates to other aspects like health, identity, gender roles, worldview, memory, and emotions. For the Classic Maya site of Sih, Yucatan, our case study, the research is oriented towards the gastronomy of the elites. Through the study of chemical residues and identification of starch granules in ceramic fragments of five types of containers namely dishes, bowls, jars, vases, and basins. This study aimed at identifying related ingredients, preparation processes and service practices, suggesting particular ways of cooking and consumption patterns. The test results were compared and supplemented with zooarchaeological evidence, iconography, historical and ethnographic records.

TI  - Upper-tropospheric bridging of wintertime surface climate variability in the Euro-Atlantic region and northern Asia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A remarkable feature of interannual climate variability is a robust link of wintertime anomalies of surface air temperature (SAT) in northern Asia to pan-Atlantic SAT variations associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Here statistical analyses of data from the era of satellite observations (1979-2017) are used to show that about 80% of the variance of the winter (December-March) mean area-averaged SAT anomalies in northern Asia can be explained by the anomalous surface circulation associated with an NAO-like mode of sea level pressure variability over extratropical Eurasia. These SAT anomalies are related equally strongly to the "Lake Baikal" vortex representing variations of the upper-tropospheric circulation over northern Asia. Support is given for the scenario that this vortex drives SAT anomalies in northern Asia via surface-reaching displacements of isentropic surfaces and that it is coupled to climate variability in the Euro-Atlantic sector via interactions between the North Atlantic storm track, quasi-stationary planetary waves, and zonal-mean zonal winds. The results underpin the importance of a lesser-known zonal wavenumber-3 structure of disturbances trapped over Eurasia by the polar front jet rather than the better-known zonal wave number-5 structure of disturbances trapped by the subtropical jet for NAO teleconnections.

TI  - Estimation of soil moisture using a vegetation scattering model in wheat fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a vegetation scattering model to eliminate the effect of vegetation and surface roughness on the radar signal. The canopy water content is an important variable associated with the scattering effect of vegetation, and it can be calculated using the leaf area index, which is retrieved from PROSAILH optical model based on Landsat-8 images. The scattering model introduced the direct scattering contribution of underlying ground into the water cloud model. The experimental correlation length was replaced by a fitting parameter from C-band RADSARSAT-2 radar data to calculate the scattering contribution of underlying ground. Results demonstrate that the vegetation scattering model has a good performance in soil moisture retrieval with R-2 of 0.805 and root-mean-square error of 0.039 m(3).m(-3). The applicability and capability of the scattering model will provide the operational potential of C-band radar data for soil moisture retrieval in an agricultural region. (C) The Authors.

TI  - On-Orbit Radiometric Calibration of High-Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Satellite Based on Sub-Pixel
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration is one of the key technologies for quantitative application of optical remote sensing satellite data. This study proposes an on-orbit radiometric calibration approach for a high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite based on sub pixel targets. The detection reference is the reflected point source, and the ground synchronization measurement is mainly used. Atmospheric transmittance and incident pupil radiance are obtained by simplifying radiometric transfer calculation. The method can also effectively isolate the response of a remote sensing image created by sub-pixel targets from the response produced by sky path radiance, ground-atmospheric coupled radiance, and background radiance, according to multi-energy sub-pixel target setting and on-orbit point spread function detection results.The approach can break the limit of time, locale, and weather conditions and achieve high precision calibration for the optical remote sensing satellite with a full dynamic range in complex environments. Results show that calibration uncertainty for the high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite based on sub-pixel targets is lower than 3.2%. Moreover, the calibration result of the proposed method is different from that of the gray-scale target method by 3%. A small and light sub-pixel target can satisfy the high frequency on-orbit calibration application of the optical sensing satellite.Results show that calibration uncertainty for the high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite based on sub-pixel targets is lower than 3.2%.

TI  - Improved algorithm of aerosol particle size distribution based on remote sensing data
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical parameters (extinction or backscatter coefficients) of multi-wavelength beams can be used for the retrieval of the aerosol particle size distribution (APSD). An improved algorithm for APSD and aerosol micro-physical parameters (AMPs) is studied and discussed by using only multi-wavelength extinction coefficients data. The regularized algorithm and prior value are combined, for the retrieval of APSD and AMPs. The regularization algorithm, based on minimum discrepancy principle and averaging procedure, is used for the retrieval of fine-mode APSD and an averaging procedure that can achieve stable outputs is proposed. The 1% averaging result near the minimum of the discrepancy is selected and verified. Based on the inversion results of fine mode from the regularization algorithm, the lognormal distribution with a prior value (model radius) is applied to reconstruct the coarse mode of APSDs through fitting the data. The comprehensive application of the regularization algorithm and averaging process improves the stability of the inversion in the fine mode, and the use of the prior value broadens the inversion radius range of APSD. The complex refractive index need not be assumed for this method. The inversion error for different types of aerosols is analyzed and studied. The reliability of the algorithm is tested and verified by many typical APSDs and the measured APSDs by particle size spectrometer in different pollution days. The algorithm sensitivity analysis is also provided and discussed. The algorithm can obtain reliable inversion of APSD and AMPs with large radius range. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America

TI  - InSAR technique applied to the monitoring of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Railway is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is the highest-altitude railway in the world. With the influence of human activities and geological disasters, it is necessary to monitor ground deformation along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. In this paper, Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) (T405 and T133) and TerraSAR-X data were used to monitor the Lhasa-Naqu section of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway from 2003 to 2012. The data period covers the time before and after the opening of the railway (total of 10 years). This study used full rank matrix small baseline subset InSAR (FRAM-SBAS) time-series analysis to analyze the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Before the opening of the railway (from 2003 to 2005), the Lhasa-Naqu road surface deformation was not obvious, with a maximum deformation of approximately 5mm yr(-1); in 2007, the railway was completed and opened to traffic, and the resulting subsidence of the railway in the district of Damxung was obvious (20mm yr(-1)). After the opening of the railway (from 2008 to 2010), the Damxung segment included a considerable area of subsidence, while the northern section of the railway was relatively stable. The results indicate that FRAM-SBAS technology is capable of providing comprehensive and detailed subsidence information regarding railways with millimeter-level accuracy. An analysis of the distribution of geological hazards in the Damxung area revealed that the distribution of the subsidence area coincided with that of the geological hazards, indicating that the occurrence of subsidence in the Damxung area was related to the influence of surrounding geological hazards and faults. Overall, the peripheral surface of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway is relatively stable but still needs to be verified with real-time monitoring to ensure that the safety of the railway is maintained.

TI  - Wastewater leakage in West Texas revealed by satellite radar imagery and numerical modeling
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater, a byproduct of oil and gas production, is injected into disposal wells. Using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to observe ground deformation in the Ken Regan field, West Texas, we detected surface uplift that occurred near a wastewater disposal well from 2007 to 2011. High correlation between the observed deformation and the injection volume suggests that the uplift was caused by wastewater disposal in the well. Inverse elastic models were first used to calculate the injection depth and volume. Given the initial estimates of wastewater injection, forward poroelastic finite element models were applied to simulate stress/strain and displacement fields and to estimate the effective injection volume and depth, so as to ultimately understand the subsurface geomechanical processes and provide insight into the local hydrologic properties of the strata in the well location. Results from both elastic and poroelastic models indicate that the effective injection depth is much shallower than the depth reported to the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC). The most reasonable explanation is that the well was experiencing leakage due to casing failures and/or sealing problem(s). The Rustler Aquifer, within the zone of the effective injection depth, has been used as a source of freshwater for irrigation and livestock; wastewater leaked into this aquifer may possibly contaminate that freshwater. Our analysis that exploits remote sensing data and numerical models provides a clue as to understanding the subsurface hydrogeological process responding to the oil and gas activities and an indirect leakage monitoring method to supplement current infrequent leakage detection.

TI  - Non-path dependent urban growth potential mapping using a data-driven evidential belief function
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improper urbanization and its environmental impacts have imposed many problems to humanity. Recently, numerous studies have been conducted using different methods to understand and manage spatial and temporal changes in urbanization. In this study, the capability of the data-driven evidential belief function model as a non-path dependent urban growth potential mapping method was evaluated. Using this approach, the conventional trend-based urban growth prediction procedure is transformed into a data integration task through which the potential locations for urban sprawl in response to multiple environmental and anthropogenic variables could be determined. Therefore, true knowledge about urban growth conditioning factors and their quantitative relationships with built-up areas can be obtained. The multivariate-based logistic regression model as a well-known urban growth modelling method was employed to check the efficiency and validity of the proposed evidential belief function model. Furthermore, a hybrid approach based on the logistic regression model results coupled with the data-driven evidential belief function model was developed. The validation results using the relative operating characteristic method indicated that the evidential belief function, logistic regression, and the hybrid methods' accuracy were 91.81, 84.72, and 92.34%, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that while the proposed evidential belief function and hybrid methods for non-path dependent urban growth potential mapping yielded approximately equal results, both of them outperformed the logistic regression model which is an indication of their reliability and accuracy. The proposed evidential belief function and hybrid methods are best suited for integration in different environmental and socio-economic scenarios enhancing the models for urban allocation tasks. In this way, local communities and policy-makers can make smarter decisions.

TI  - Generation of high-quality digital elevation models by assimilation of remote sensing-based DEMs
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced spaceborne remote sensing techniques are currently available for the generation of high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) aiding in the advancement of Earth's topographic modeling. DEM assimilation using data-driven models is a technique that can effectively overcome the limitations of individual DEMs generated from different techniques and sources of remote sensing data. The assimilation of DEMs generated from optical stereo pairs (Cartosat-1) and InSAR pair (ALOS PALSAR-1) was done for improving the DEM quality. Further, by using data assimilation techniques, the openly accessible DEM products derived from remote sensing datasets were used for generation of improved high-quality DEMs. The feature level fusion and the Kalman optimal interpolation techniques were used for the assimilation of these DEMs. Three sites, namely Dehradun, Jaipur, and Kendrapara, were selected on basis of topographic conditions, i.e., rugged, moderate, and gentle. RMSEs calculated for Dehradun and Jaipur have shown significant improvement in assimilated DEMs. Assimilation of CartoDEM V3 R1 and ALOS PALSAR RTC HR DEMs at the Jaipur site has resulted in highly improved RMSE in elevation of 1.22 m using the Kalman optimum interpolation model. However, in case of the plain region of Kendrapara, the CartoDEM V3 R1 data are found to have the highest accuracy of 2.00 m, indicating importance of selective use of input DEMs and assimilation methods.

TI  - Schmallenberg virus: a systematic international literature review (2011-2019) from an Irish perspective
T2  - IRISH VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - In Autumn 2011, nonspecific clinical signs of pyrexia, diarrhoea, and drop in milk yield were observed in dairy cattle near the German town of Schmallenberg at the Dutch/German border. Targeted veterinary diagnostic investigations for classical endemic and emerging viruses could not identify a causal agent. Blood samples were collected from animals with clinical signs and subjected to metagenomic analysis; a novel orthobunyavirus was identified and named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). In late 2011/early 2012, an epidemic of abortions and congenital malformations in calves, lambs and goat kids, characterised by arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly were reported in continental Europe. Subsequently, SBV RNA was confirmed in both aborted and congenitally malformed foetuses and also in Culicoides species biting midges. It soon became evident that SBV was an arthropod-borne teratogenic virus affecting domestic ruminants. SBV rapidly achieved a pan-European distribution with most countries confirming SBV infection within a year or two of the initial emergence. The first Irish case of SBV was confirmed in the south of the country in late 2012 in a bovine foetus.Since SBV was first identified in 2011, a considerable body of scientific research has been conducted internationally describing this novel emerging virus. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive synopsis of the most up-to-date scientific literature regarding the origin of SBV and the spread of the Schmallenberg epidemic, in addition to describing the species affected, clinical signs, pathogenesis, transmission, risk factors, impact, diagnostics, surveillance methods and control measures. This review also highlights current knowledge gaps in the scientific literature regarding SBV, most notably the requirement for further research to determine if, and to what extent, SBV circulation occurred in Europe and internationally during 2017 and 2018. Moreover, recommendations are also made regarding future arbovirus surveillance in Europe, specifically the establishment of a European-wide sentinel herd surveillance program, which incorporates bovine serology and Culicoides entomology and virology studies, at national and international level to monitor for the emergence and re-emergence of arboviruses such as SBV, bluetongue virus and other novel Culicoides-borne arboviruses.

TI  - Spatial distribution of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato larvae in the urban environment of Yaounde, Cameroon
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The rapid and unplanned urbanization of African cities is considered to increase the risk of urban malaria transmission. The present study objective was to assess factors influencing the spatio-temporal distribution of Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in the city of Yaounde, Cameroon. Methods All water bodies were checked once every 2 months for the presence of mosquito larvae from March 2017 to May 2018 in 32 districts of Yaounde. Physico-chemical characteristics including the size, depth, turbidity, pH, temperature, conductivity, sulfates, organophosphates, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), conductivity, iron and calcium were recorded and analyzed according to anopheline larvae presence or absence. High resolution satellite images from landsat sentinel Enhanced Thematic Mapper were used for spatial mapping of both field and environmental variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables closely associated with anopheline larvae distribution. Results A total of 18 696 aquatic habitats were checked and only 2942 sites (15.7%) contained anopheline larvae. A high number of sites with anopheline larvae (>= 69%) presented late instar larvae (L3, L4 and pupae). Anopheline mosquito larvae were sampled from a variety of breeding sites including puddles (51.6%), tire prints (12.9%), wells (11.7%) and drains (11.3%). Bivariate logistic regression analyses associated anopheline larvae presence with the absence of predators, absence of algae, absence of vegetation and depth of less than 1 m. Conductivity, turbidity, organophosphates, H2O2 and temperature were significantly high in breeding sites with anopheline larvae than in breeding sites without these larvae (P < 0.1). Anopheline species collected included An. coluzzii (91.1%) and An. gambiae s.s. (8.9%). GIS mapping indicated a heterogeneous distribution of anopheline breeding habitats in the city of Yaounde. Land cover analysis indicated high variability of the city of Yaounde's landscape. Conclusions The data confirms adaptation of An. gambiae s.l. to the urban domain in the city of Yaounde and calls for urgent actions to improve malaria vector control.

TI  - Mapping defoliation by leaf-cutting ants <i>Atta</i> species in <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantations using the Sentinel-2 sensor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf-cutting ants are one of the most important pests of eucalyptus plantations and it is essential to monitor and control these insects to avoid damage to wood production. The objective of this research was to assess the utility of the multispectral sensor, Sentinel-2 (S-2) in mapping defoliation caused by leaf-cutting ants in Eucalyptus plantations. The study was carried out in Eucalyptus plantations in Tel?maco Borba, Paran? state, Brazil. The leaf-cutting ant nests were located, measured and georeferenced. Multispectral images from bands 2, 3, 4 and 8 of the S-2 satellite and four vegetation indices (VIs) were tested in predicting and mapping leaf-cutting ant defoliation. From each image scene the reflectance values were extracted and a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed. The predictive variables, included in the PLS-DA regression, were selected based on the calculation of the variable importance in the projection (VIP). The accuracy of the mapping was 84.5% using six main components, demonstrating a satisfactory approach to operationally classifying canopies of Eucalyptus stands attacked by leaf-cutting ants. The study indicates the potential of freely available medium resolution Multispectral instrument (MSI) S-2 images, to accurately detect and map defoliation caused by Atta species in commercial forest plantations.

TI  - The impact of drought spells on forests depends on site conditions: The case of 2017 summer heat wave in southern Europe
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A major component of climate change is an increase in temperature and precipitation variability. Over the last few decades, an increase in the frequency of extremely warm temperatures and drought severity has been observed across Europe. These warmer and drier conditions may reduce productivity and trigger compositional shifts in forest communities. However, we still lack a robust, biogeographical characterization of the negative impacts of climate extremes, such as droughts on forests. In this context, we investigated the impact of the 2017 summer drought on European forests. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as a proxy of forest productivity and was related to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, which accounts for the temperature effects of the climate water balance. The spatial pattern of NDVI reduction in 2017 was largely driven by the extremely warm summer for parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean Basin (Italian and Balkan Peninsulas). The vulnerability to the 2017 summer drought was heterogeneously distributed over Europe, and topographic factors buffered some of the negative impacts. Mediterranean forests dominated by oak species were the most negatively impacted, whereas Pinus pinaster was the most resilient species. The impact of drought on the NDVI decreased at high elevations and mainly on east and north-east facing slopes. We illustrate how an adequate characterization of the coupling between climate conditions and forest productivity (NDVI) allows the determination of the most vulnerable areas to drought. This approach could be widely used for other extreme climate events and when considering other spatially resolved proxies of forest growth and health.

TI  - A new temporal prediction method of grazing pressure based on normalized difference vegetation index and precipitation using nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input networks
T2  - GRASSLAND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of natural vegetation in arid and semi-arid grasslands is facing severe challenges. The vegetation is easy to lose their vitality, resulting in the loss of the cover in natural grasslands under the high grazing pressure. To address this situation, this paper proposes a novel method for accurately predicting the grazing pressure using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) network based on the remote sensing data of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation. The proposed method uses the NARX networks to predict the temporal variations of the NDVI with respect to the precipitation. The grazing pressure can be thus calculated using the predicted values of the NDVI. For practical application, this study investigated an arid and semi-arid grassland with heavy grazing pressure in Hulunbuir, China. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide an accurate prediction of the grazing pressure (mean absolute error 0.103, root-mean-square error 0.122, mean absolute percentage error 8.36% and coefficient of determination 0.899 at the confidence interval of 95%). In addition, the predicted values of the grazing pressure in the study area during the years from 2016 to 2020 can be obtained using the proposed method. The proposed method can obtain a good prediction of the grazing pressure, which can be further used as a guidance for the rangeland managers to reduce the occurrence of the overgrazing.

TI  - [Spatio-temporal Variations in Aquatic Vegetation Cover and the Potential Influencing Factors in Lake Hongze Based on MODIS Images].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Aquatic vegetation is an important part of lake ecosystems and plays a vital role in improving water quality and maintaining biodiversity. At present, China's lakes are facing eutrophication and the degradation of aquatic vegetation. The monitoring of temporal and spatial variations in aquatic vegetation and elucidating the main influencing factors are of great significance for protecting aquatic vegetation and restoring eutrophic lake ecosystems. Therefore, we introduced the Vegetation Present Frequency (VPF) method to extract data on aquatic vegetation and combined this with meteorological factors and human activities to analyze the temporal and spatial in Lake Hongze based on MODIS data from 2007 to 2017. The VPF of aquatic vegetation in Lake Hongze showed clear seasonal and interannual variations. The VPF was significantly higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter (P<0.05, one way-ANOVA). The maximum VPF of 0.43 occurred in June but the minimum VPF of 0.21 was recorded in January. The VPF from April to October, during the growing season of aquatic vegetation, was significantly higher than in other months. The annual mean VPF of the northern lake area (Z1) decreased significantly (R2=0.56, P<0.01), ranging from the highest value of 0.50 in 2008 to the lowest value of 0.27 in 2016 (a decrease of 45.8%), indicating a significant loss of aquatic vegetation. Spatially, the VPF of Lake Hongze decreases from the coastal zone to the open water, and the VPF values of the northern (Z1) and western sub-lakes (Z2) are higher than that of other lakes segments (Z3-Z5). The interannual variation in VPF for the entire lake was not significantly affected by annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, annual mean wind speed, or annual sunshine duration (P>0.05), indicating that meteorological factors have little influence on interannual variation of aquatic vegetation in this lake. However, total suspended matter concentration was significantly negatively correlated with VPF in Z1 area (R2=0.48, P<0.01), with strong sand-mining activities occurring in this area. These results indicate that the increase of total suspended matter concentrations caused by sand mining is an important driving factor in the decline of aquatic vegetation in the Z1 segment.

TI  - Data Descriptor: Daily observations of stable isotope ratios of rainfall in the tropics
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We present precipitation isotope data (delta H-2 and delta O-18 values) from 19 stations across the tropics collected from 2012 to 2017 under the Coordinated Research Project F31004 sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Rainfall samples were collected daily and analysed for stable isotopic ratios of oxygen and hydrogen by participating laboratories following a common analytical framework. We also calculated daily mean stratiform rainfall area fractions around each station over an area of 5 degrees x 5 degrees longitude/latitude based on TRMM/GPM satellite data. Isotope time series, along with information on rainfall amount and stratiform/convective proportions provide a valuable tool for rainfall characterisation and to improve the ability of isotope-enabled Global Circulation Models to predict variability and availability of inputs to fresh water resources across the tropics.

TI  - Twelve years of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in the Netherlands: Impact on incidence and clinical outcomes of invasive pneumococcal disease
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In 2006, the Netherlands introduced the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in their national immunisation programme. In 2011, PCV7 was replaced by the 10-valent vaccine (PCV10). We report on the impact of PCV on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence, clinical syndromes and patient outcomes.Methods: Pneumococcal isolates of hospitalised IPD patients between June 2004 and May 2018 were obtained from nine sentinel laboratories, covering 25% of the Dutch population. All isolates were serotyped. IPD incidence and clinical outcome were determined before and after introduction of PCV7 and after the switch to PCV10, stratified by age and serotype.Results: Compared to before PCV7 introduction, significant declines in IPD incidence were observed in 2016-2018 in children <5 years (69%), 18-49 year olds (31%) and >= 65 year olds (19%). Compared to before PCV10 introduction, the IPD incidence in 2016-2018 declined in children <5 years (RR:0.68, 95%CI:0.42-1.11), 5-17 year olds (RR:0.58, 95%CI:0.29-1.14) and 18-49 year olds (RR:0.72, 95%CI:0.57-0.90), but not in 50-64 year olds (RR:0.94, 95%CI:0.81-1.10) and >= 65 year olds (RR:1.04, 95%CI:0.0.93-1.15). While the case fatality rate (CFR) decreased from 16.2% pre-PCV to 13.4% post-PCV10 (RR:0.83, 95%CI:0.70-0.99), the switch to PCV10 had no further impact on CFR (RR:1.14, 95%CI:0.96-1.36).Conclusion: Twelve years of PCV in the Netherlands has resulted in a sustained reduction of IPD incidence in children and younger adults. The switch from PCV7 to PCV10 did not have additional impact on the IPD incidence in older adults and CFR due to emerging non-vaccine serotypes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - [Evaluation of MACC Reanalysis Ozone Data over China Using Ground-based and AIRS Satellite Observations].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A comparative analysis was conducted using total ozone products derived from monitoring atmospheric composition and climate (MACC) reanalysis data validated with ozone data from the atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) satellite and ground-based ozone measurements. The results indicate that the relative deviation of total ozone from the MACC reanalysis data and the ground-based ozone total data is controlled within 17%, and all of the correlation coefficients were between 0.79 and 0.97. The total ozone values from the MACC reanalysis data showed good consistency with the ground-based ozone measurements. With respect to the spatial distribution of multi-year averages, the relative deviation of total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data and the AIRS satellite data was between -3% and 5%. The total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data were higher than those from AIRS measurements for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the coastal areas of South China, and were lower for northeast China. Furthermore, the seasonal variations in total ozone values in the MACC reanalysis data were consistent with AIRS data. At Mt. Waliguan station, the monthly averaged trends for near-surface ozone in the MACC reanalysis data were also consistent with surface ozone concentrations; the MACC reanalysis data reflect the observed trends for surface-based ozone measurements in spring, summer, and autumn, but show a large deviation in winter.

TI  - Transcriptome Analyses of FY Mutants Reveal Its Role in mRNA Alternative Polyadenylation.
T2  - The Plant cell
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A crucial step for mRNA polyadenylation is poly(A) signal recognition by trans-acting factors. The mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex components CPSF30 and WD repeat-containing protein33 (WDR33) recognize the canonical AAUAAA for polyadenylation. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the flowering time regulator FY is the homolog of WDR33. However, its role in mRNA polyadenylation is poorly understood. Using poly(A) tag sequencing, we found that >50% of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events are altered in fy single mutants or double mutants with oxt6 (a null mutant of AtCPSF30), but mutation of the FY WD40-repeat has a stronger effect than deletion of the plant-unique Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro-Pro (PPLPP) domain. fy mutations disrupt AAUAAA or AAUAAA-like poly(A) signal recognition. Notably, A-rich signal usage is suppressed in the WD40-repeat mutation but promoted in PPLPP-domain deficiency. However, fy mutations do not aggravate the altered signal usage in oxt6. Furthermore, the WD40-repeat mutation shows a preference for 3' untranslated region shortening, but the PPLPP-domain deficiency shows a preference for lengthening. Interestingly, the WD40-repeat mutant exhibits shortened primary roots and late flowering with alteration of APA of related genes. Importantly, the long transcripts of two APA genes affected in fy are related to abiotic stress responses. These results reveal a conserved and specific role of FY in mRNA polyadenylation.

TI  - Planar Cell Polarity Effector Proteins Inturned and Fuzzy Form a Rab23 GEF Complex
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A subset of Rab GTPases have been implicated in cilium formation in cultured mammalian cells [1-6]. Rab11 and Rab8, together with their GDP-GTP exchange factors (GEFs), TRAPP-II and Rabin8, promote recruitment of the ciliary vesicle to the mother centriole and its subsequent maturation, docking, and fusion with the cell surface [2-5]. Rab23 has been linked to cilium formation and membrane trafficking at mature cilia [1, 7, 8]; however, the identity of the GEF pathway activating Rab23, a member of the Rab7 subfamily of Rabs, remains unclear. Longin-domain-containing complexes have been shown to act as GEFs for Rab7 subfamily GTPases [9-12]. Here, we show that Inturned and Fuzzy, proteins previously implicated as planar cell polarity (PCP) effectors and in developmentally regulated cilium formation [13, 14], contain multiple longin domains characteristic of the Mon1-Ccz1 family of Rab7 GEFs and form a specific Rab23 GEF complex. In flies, loss of Rab23 function gave rise to defects in planar-polarized trichome formation consistent with this biochemical relationship. In cultured human and mouse cells, Inturned and Fuzzy localized to the basal body and proximal region of cilia, and cilium formation was compromised by depletion of either Inturned or Fuzzy. Cilium formation arrested after docking of the ciliary vesicle to the mother centriole but prior to axoneme elongation and fusion of the ciliary vesicle and plasma membrane. These findings extend the family of longin domain GEFs and define a molecular activity linking Rab23-regulated membrane traffic to cilia and planar cell polarity.

TI  - Era of Genomic Medicine: A Narrative Review on CRISPR Technology as a Potential Therapeutic Tool for Human Diseases
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) provides acquired immunity in microorganisms against exogenous DNA that may hinder the survival of the organism. Pioneering work by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012 resulted in the creation of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool on the basis of this concept. The aim of this was to create a rapid, efficient, and versatile genome-editing tool to facilitate genetic manipulation. The mechanism relies on two components: the RNA guide which acts as a sentinel and a Cas protein complex which functions as a highly precise molecular knife. The guide RNA can be modified to match a DNA sequence of interest in the cell and accordingly be used to rectify mutations that may otherwise cause disease. Within a few years following the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, its usage has become ubiquitous. Its influence extends into many fields of biological sciences from biotechnology and biochemistry to molecular biology and biomedical sciences. The following review aims at shedding some light on to the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in the field of biomedical sciences, particularly gene therapy. An insight with relation to a few of the many diseases that are being tackled with the aid of the CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism and the trends, successes, and challenges of this application as a gene therapy are discussed in this review.

TI  - The surface albedo of the Greenland Ice Sheet between 1982 and 2015 from the CLARA-A2 dataset and its relationship to the ice sheet's surface mass balance
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing mass at a significant rate, driven in part by increasing surface-melt-induced runoff. Because the ice sheet's surface melt is closely connected to changes in the surface albedo, studying multi-decadal changes in the ice sheet's albedo offers insight into surface melt and associated changes in its surface mass balance. Here, we first analyse the CM SAF Cloud, Albedo and Surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data second edition (CLARA-A2) Surface Albedo (SAL), covering 1982-2015, to obtain decadal albedo trends for each summer month. We also examine the rates of albedo change during the early summer, supported with atmospheric reanalysis data from MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2), to discern changes in the intensity of early summer melt, and their likely drivers. We find that rates of albedo decrease during summer melt have accelerated during the 2000s relative to the early 1980s and that the surface albedos now often decrease to values typical of bare ice at elevations 50-100 m higher on the ice sheet. The southern margins exhibit the opposite behaviour, though, and we suggest this is due to increasing snowfall over the area.We then subtract ice discharge from the mass balance estimates observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to estimate surface mass balance. The CLARA-A2 albedo changes are regressed with these data to obtain a summer-aggregated proxy surface mass balance time series for the summer periods 1982-2015. This proxy time series is compared with latest regional climate model estimates from the MAR model to perform an observation-based test on the dominance of surface runoff in the magnitude and variability of the summer surface mass balance. We show that the proxy time series agrees with MAR through the analysed period within the associated uncertainties of the data and methods, demonstrating and confirming that surface runoff has dominated the rapid surface mass loss period between the 1990s and 2010s.Finally, we extend the analysis to the drainage basin scale to examine discharge-albedo relationships. We find little evidence of surface-melt-induced ice flow acceleration at annual timescales.

TI  - Efficiency analysis of Indian banking industry over the period 2008-2017 using data envelopment analysis
T2  - BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to estimate the relative efficiencies of banks of the Indian domestic banking sector by employing various models of data envelopment analysis (DEA) using the panel data of the recent decade (2008-2017). The paper provides a comparative analysis of these models based on the efficiency outputs. It compares the performance of banks based on their ownership and sizes and studies the decade-long trend of productivity using Malmquist indices. Design/methodology/approach This paper estimates overall technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of 21 public sector banks and 17 private banks. It compares the descriptive statistics of efficiency estimates found out through 18 different DEA models and compares them using two non-parametric statistical tests. It studies the difference in efficiencies based on ownership and size by applying the same statistical tests. It employs the Malmquist index method to study the technological and technical progress in the banks' productivity over the decade of FY 2008-FY 2017. Findings During FY 2016-2017, only 9 out of 38 banks were overall technically efficient with the whole sample having a mean overall technical inefficiency of 5 percent with scale inefficiency contributing more than pure technical inefficiency. The comparative study ascertains that private sector and public sector banks (PSBs) possess efficiencies that are similar based on super-efficiency slack-based model - variable returns to scale and non-oriented, a model that the authors argue to be the most suitable for the real-life business banking scenarios whereas the private sector banks possess better efficiency than the PSBs. The Malmquist indices prove that private sector banks have a higher increase in productivity based on both technological progress and efficiency improvements whereas PSBs had a loss of efficiency and comparatively less improvement in technology. Originality/value This study is based on the panel data of the recent decade (2008-2017) and provides insights into the efficiency scenario of the Indian banking industry and how it changed over the past decade, to the leadership of banks, the banking regulators and the policy makers. The comparative analysis of DEA models based on a sample of Indian banks is first of its kind in the Indian context and helps the researchers to select an appropriate model and delve into further research on the same.

TI  - Satellite-Based Assessment of Various Cloud Microphysics Schemes in Simulating Typhoon Hydrometeors
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate simulation of typhoon hydrometeors remains a challenge. This study attempts to evaluate the performances of five microphysics schemes (MPSs) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in simulating the supertyphoon Neoguri in July 2014. The observed microwave brightness temperature, as well as retrieved data from the microwave radiometer imager (MWRI) onboard Chinese FY-3B satellite, are used to test hydrometeor simulations. In particular, two MWRI radiance indices, including the emission index (EI) and scattering index (SI), are used to assess the performance of five MPSs in simulating liquid and frozen hydrometeors, respectively. Overall, the WRF model can well reproduce the overall pattern of typhoon-produced precipitation, albeit with slightly overestimated precipitation in the inner rainband and underestimated precipitation in the stratiform rainband. Moreover, ice water paths (IWPs) from all five MPS simulations are higher than those estimated from MWRI retrieval in most areas, and the spatial pattern and values of IWP for the National Severe Storms Laboratory double-moment MPS (NSSL) are much closer to those for MWRI. The NSSL scheme reproduces a more realistic joint histogram distribution of SI and EI than other MPSs do, relative to the observation. Besides, the nonlinear Lucas-Kanade optical flow approach has been used to reflect the horizontal distribution of hydrometeors in the typhoon. The results show that the simulated EI and SI from the five MPSs show a systematic southwest bias of approximately about 10 similar to 20 km and significant intensity bias in the convection area. Further model sensitivity tests confirm that the NSSL scheme generates more realistic graupel and supercooled water close to the observations among all MPSs. The findings suggest that satellite measurements would be helpful to assess MPSs in numeric weather models, especially for hydrometeor distributions in the whole typhoon system.

TI  - An evidence-based analysis of the management of N0 neck in patients with cancer of the parotid gland
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Management of clinically negative neck (cN0) in patients with parotid gland cancer is controversial. Treatment options can include observation, elective neck dissection or elective radiotherapy. Areas covered: We addressed the treatment options for cN0 patients with parotid gland cancer. A literature review was undertaken to determine the optimal management of this group of patients. Expert opinion: Patients with parotid carcinoma and clinically negative neck have various options for their management. The analysis of tumor stage, histology and grade is essential to better define patients at risk for occult lymph node metastasis. These patients can be managed by surgery, radiotherapy or their combination, depending on the presence of risk factors, the moment at which such risk factors are detected, patient-related clinical conditions, medical provider expertise and institutional facilities.

TI  - Crop insurance model to consolidate academia-industry cooperation: a case study over Assam, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is one of the deciding factors of Indian economy, contributing almost 17% of the total GDP. Every year, crops are lost due to natural disasters. This academic research may provide a solution for a long-standing problem in the industry. Crop insurance is one of the most effective ways to not only compensate loss, but also to increase poor farmers' resilience. Remote sensing has huge potential in the crop insurance market; it can be exploited for vulnerability mapping, damage assessment, risk mapping, and various other aspects. The purpose of this study was to present a method for evaluating crop vulnerability over an area using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), followed by an assessment of crops damaged due to flood. For application purposes, a crop risk map was prepared from a GIS model for the determination of crop insurance parameters. The study area selected (i.e., the Morigaon and Nagaon districts of Assam) is very much flood-prone. The districts have almost 50% agricultural land of the total land cover, thus making the crops very vulnerable to recurrent flooding. For this study, assessment of damage to crops due to flood was performed for a full year, followed by crop risk map generation from the GIS model. The results revealed that 345 km(2) of land was inundated by flood in August 2016. Due to the flooding, 1435.08 km(2) of agricultural land bearing crops was damaged at different levels. The crop risk map depicts 103.33 km(2) of cropland at high risk due to flood.

TI  - Discrimination of different sea ice types from CryoSat-2 satellite data using an Object-based Random Forest (ORF)
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice type is one of the most sensitive variables in Arctic sea ice monitoring, and it is important for the retrieval of ice thickness. In this study, we analyzed various waveform features that characterize the echo waveform shape and Sigma0 (i.e., backscatter coefficient) of CryoSat-2 synthetic aperture radar altimeter data over different sea ice types. Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute operational ice charts were input as reference. An object-based random forest (ORF) classification method is proposed with overall classification accuracy of 90.1%. Accuracy of 92.7% was achieved for first-year ice (FYI), which is the domain ice type in the Arctic. Accuracy of 76.7% was achieved at the border of FYI and multiyear ice (MYI), which is better than current state-of-the-art methods. Accuracy of 83.8% was achieved for MYI. Results showed the overall accuracy of the ORF method was increased by ?8% in comparison with other methods, and the classification accuracy at the border of FYI and MYI was increased by ?10.5%. Nevertheless, ORF classification performance might be influenced by the selected waveform features, snow loading, and the ability to distinguish sea ice from leads.

TI  - Post-Soviet Land-Use Change Affected Fire Regimes on the Eurasian Steppes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important disturbance in grassland ecosystems. Anthropogenic factors, especially land use, have drastically altered fire regimes in many regions, but how changing land-use intensity affects fire patterns remains weakly understood. Here, we reconstruct changes in fire regimes between 1989 and 2016 for the understudied Eurasian steppes, where major land-use changes happened after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. We mapped burned areas in a 540,000 km(2) study region in northern Kazakhstan for 3-year periods centered on 1990, 2000, and 2015, based on all available Landsat imagery. We then used these maps to assess changes in the extent, number, and size of fires over time, and to explore links between changes in fire regimes and agriculture. We found a sevenfold increase in total burned area and an eightfold increase in fire numbers between 1990 and 2000. After 2000, burned area and fire numbers declined slightly, while fire size remained stable. Most of the observed increase in fires in the 1990s occurred on cropland, most likely due to the agricultural burning. The abandonment of cropland and pastures was also associated with intensified fire regimes, likely due to increased aboveground biomass and thus higher fuel loads. Overall, our results suggest that intensifying fire regimes on the Eurasian steppe are clearly linked to post-Soviet changes in agriculture. Given that fires on Eurasia's steppes have wide-ranging consequences, affecting regions as far away as the Arctic, better regulation of agricultural practices, better fire monitoring, and more proactive fire management are needed.

AB  - The development and proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in recent years presents a new data collection opportunity for invasive alien plant (IAP) research. The flexibility and cost-efficiency of these craft offers a valuable solution where high-spatial or high-temporal resolution remotely sensed data are required. In this paper, we review all published studies using UAV for remote data collection in IAP research. We have systematically identified the taxonomy and habitat characteristics of the system studied, classified the UAV configuration, analytical methods and the limitations of each study. We used this synthesis to identify research gaps, suggest directions for future research, and identify opportunities for practical application of the technology.

TI  - Satellite-Driven Estimates of Water Mass Formation and Their Spatio-Temporal Evolution
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We derive water mass transformation and formation rates using satellite-derived datasets of salinity, temperature and fluxes of heat and freshwater over the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean. The formation rates are expressed in three coordinate systems: (1) density, (2) temperature-salinity and (3) latitude-longitude. In the North Atlantic and North Pacific, peak formation occurs south of the western boundary current extensions during the winter months of the study period. In the Southern Ocean, wintertime peak formation occurs just north of the sub-Antarctic Front. The satellite-derived water mass properties and formation areas agree well with previous estimates from literature. The location of peak Mode Water formation varies slightly with time in all coordinate systems. We assess seasonal and inter-annual variability in all three basins from 2012 to 2014. We assess the impact of satellite uncertainties on final estimates of formation rates and areas with Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulations provide insights on the associated uncertainty of formation estimates. They also provide information on the geographic spread of the water mass formation area subject to the satellite errors. We find that the total uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the sea surface salinity dataset. This stresses the need for frequent and increasingly accurate sea surface salinity data for reliable estimates of water mass formation rates and areas. Our study highlights the feasibility of providing satellite-based estimates of water mass formation rates and areas. The good spatio-temporal coverage of satellite data further adds to the utility of the approach.

TI  - Asian water tower evinced in total column water vapor: a comparison among multiple satellite and reanalysis data sets
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The total column water vapor (TCWV) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is one important indicator of the Asian water tower, and the changes in the TCWV are vital to the climate and ecosystem in downstream regions. However, the observational data is insufficient to understand the changes in the TCWV due to the high elevation of the TP. Satellite and reanalysis data can be used as substitutes, but their quality needs to be evaluated. In this study, based on a homogenized radiosonde data set, a comprehensive evaluation of the TCWV over the TP derived from two satellite data sets (AIRS-only and AIRS/AMSU) and seven existing reanalysis data sets (MERRA, MERRA2, NCEP1, NCEP2, CFSR, ERA-I, JRA55) is performed in the context of the climatology, annual cycle and interannual variability. Both satellite data sets reasonably reproduce the characteristics of the TCWV over the TP. All reanalysis data sets perform well in reproducing the annual mean climatology of the TCWV over the TP (R = 0.99), except for NCEP1 (R = 0.96) and NCEP2 (R = 0.92). ERA-I is more reliable in capturing the spatial pattern of the annual cycle (R = 0.94), while NCEP1 shows the lowest skill (R = 0.72). JRA55 performs best in capturing the features of the interannual coherent variation (EOF1, R = 0.97). The skill-weighted ensemble mean of the reanalysis data performs better than the unweighted ensemble mean and most of the single reanalysis data sets. The evaluation provides essential information on both the strengths and weaknesses of the major satellite and reanalysis data sets in measuring the total column water vapor over the TP.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Thyroid Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Prophylactic central neck dissection in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma is controversial. Sentinel node biopsy might be an adjunct to optimize surgical treatment for these patients. Earlier studies reported inconsistent detection rates and diagnostic value of this technique, and the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in thyroid cancer needs to be established. Patients and methods During a single-center prospective interventional study between 2010 and 2017, sentinel lymph node biopsy using 99mTc-nanocolloidal albumin tracer was performed on patients undergoing thyroid surgery for suspected thyroid cancer by fine needle aspiration cytology. All eligible patients without clinical lymph node involvement were invited to participate. Central neck dissection was performed on all patients after the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. Results Ninety-six patients participated in the study. The detection rates of the sentinel node were 67% and 45% by scintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe, respectively. The detection rate was not associated with Bethesda score, malignancy, or presence of lymph node metastases. Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 80%, 97%, and 98%, respectively, for the sentinel node to represent the status of lymph node metastasis in the central neck compartment. The false negative rate was 20%. Conclusion Sentinel lymph node biopsy had a low detection rate and only moderate sensitivity in patients with suspected thyroid carcinoma and is not a useful adjunct to surgery in the context of current treatment concepts.

TI  - Liquid biopsies for omics-based analysis in sentinel mussels
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Liquid biopsy of plasma is a simple and non-invasive technology that holds great promise in biomedical research. It is based on the analysis of nucleic acid-based biomarkers with predictive potential. In the present work, we have combined this concept with the FTA technology for sentinel mussels. We found that hemocytes collected from liquid biopsies can be readily fixed on FTA cards and used for long-term transcriptome analysis. We also showed that liquid biopsy is easily adaptable for metagenomic analysis of bacterial profiles of mussels. We finally provide evidence that liquid biopsies contained circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) which can be used as an easily accessible genomic reservoir. Sampling of FTA-fixed circulating nucleic acids is stable at room temperature and does not necessitate a cold-chain protection. It showed comparable performance to frozen samples and is ideally adapted for sampling in remote areas, most notably in polar regions threatened by anthropogenic activities. From an ethical point of view, this minimally-invasive and non-lethal approach further reduces incidental mortality associated with conventional tissue sampling. This liquid biopsy-based approach should thus facilitate biobanking activities and development of omics-based biomarkers in mussels to assess the quality of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - A comparison of Sentinel-3-OLCI and Sentinel-2-MSI-derived Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> maps for two large Italian lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The twin satellites Sentinel-3 (S3A/B) with Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) sensors, with a spatial resolution of 300 m, and a revisiting time of 1-2 days, and the twin satellites Sentinel-2 (S2A/B) with MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) instrument, with a spatial resolution up to 10 m, offer a special opportunity to monitor at both small and large scale, phytoplankton phenology and variation at small time (OLCI) and at small spatial scale (MSI). The aim of this study was to contribute to further testing on MSI imagery, for retrieving chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, proxy of phytoplankton abundance, in inland waters. Since OLCI has higher revisiting frequency and multiple matchups with MSI, it was also examined as a surrogate for MSI. A common image-processing scheme for both sensors was applied in the two large Italian lakes Garda (oligo-mesotrophic) and Trasimeno (eutrophic). Results showed good performances, both in retrieving atmospherically corrected Remote Sensing Reflectance, and, from this last derived, chl-a concentration maps. Very good accordance was assessed between simultaneous OLCI and MSI derived chl-a maps, both in terms of magnitude, and spatial distribution, despite the fact variations in concentration at small scale were better retrieved by MSI imagery.

TI  - Reciprocal Dynamics of Dignity in End-of-Life Care: A Multiperspective Systematic Review of Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Preserving terminally ill patients' dignity and well-being through dignified and holistic care has become the overarching goal in palliative care services. However, dignity is a multifaceted concept with a wide range of interpretations under different cultural contexts. Aim: The aim of this review is to understand the variations in subjective interpretations and constitutions of dignity in palliative or end-of-life care via an integrative worldview. Design: This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline and used SPIDER tool to screen for appropriate and relevant articles for analysis. Data Sources: Four major databases were searched including CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, and PsycARTICLES between 2009 and 2018. Forty-eight qualitative studies that examined dignity from the perspectives of patients, family caregivers, and health-care professionals were selected for full text data analysis using thematic synthesis. Results: Analysis of the various concepts of dignity revealed 18 themes that were further categorized into 7 conceptual categories: (1) self-determination, (2) existential liberty, (3) relational connectedness, (4) caregiving revitalization, (5) mindful humanity, (6) patient-family care, and (7) sustainable culture. These 7 categories span across individual, familial, and institutional dimensions, forming a new Dynamic Reciprocity of Dignity model. Conclusions: The Dynamic Reciprocity of Dignity model highlights the importance of adopting a systemic lens to address dignity-related needs and concerns at the end of life, while providing insights on how compassionate care and self-compassion can serve as the foundation of dignified care, which in turn serve as a buffer against patients' existential suffering as well as caregivers' burnout and fatigue. Recommendations for clinical practice and future research directions are discussed.

TI  - Microcomedones in non-lesional acne prone skin New orientations on comedogenesis and its prevention
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In non-lesional skin of acne patients, cyanoacrylate skin surface stripping can harvest a structure called microcomedone (MC) which is the earliest phase of comedogenesis; the root of any subsequent clinical lesion and a target for the prevention of acne relapses. More information is needed on the putative biochemical contributors (biomarkers) of comedogenesis expressed in MC. Methods Proteins expressed in MC were screened by proteomics, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The in vitro effects of a comedolytic Silybum marianum fruit extract (SMFE) were studied in sebocyte cultures by RNA-Seq and modulation of CYP1A1 by qPCR and enzymatic activity. MC severity was correlated to lesions counts and keratin expression during 48 weeks in 23 acne patients using a topical comedolytic formulation containing SMFE. Results Two infundibular keratins, K75 and K79, co-localized in MC with the sebocyte progenitor cell marker LRIG1 and were used as a biomarker of comedogenesis for the follow-up of patients. In cultured sebocytes exposed to SMFE (i) transcriptomic analysis showed an up-regulation by a factor of 15 of RNA coding for K75 and (ii) the gene expression and catalytic activity of CYP1A1 under exposure to dioxin was decreased. In the acne patients using SMFE, the MC index in non-lesional skin decreased over time and remained until the 48th week, significantly lower than that of the first week. There was a high correlation between the decrease of MC index and the decrease and stability of the clinical lesions counts over time. Importantly, a low MC index status was found to be associated with a significant higher K75 expression in microcomedones. Discussion These observations provide new orientations on the mechanism of comedogenesis and its prevention. Maintaining a low MC status in non-lesional skin is a sound target for the prevention of acne relapse and a good sentinel of acne remissions.

TI  - Pre-processing of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images based on incidence angle correction for dark target detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been commonly used for oceanographic applications, such as maritime safety, fisheries management and coastal monitoring, including dark target detection. However, the incidence angle (theta) effect on these data makes a direct visualization and classification of oceanographic targets troublesome. The recent availability of free-of-charge Sentinel-1 C-band data have the potential to assess methods for correcting the theta in wide swath SAR images, an issue that still remains to be undertaken. The goal of this work was to test two methods for correcting the theta effect of two Sentinel-1 SAR imaging modes and assess their implications for dark target detection in a sector of the South Atlantic Ocean. We assessed the empirical modelling and square cosine-based methods for correcting the theta effect on co and cross-polarization from the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Extra Wide Swath (EW) imaging modes. The results showed that the empirical modelling method improved the visualization and classification of dark targets for the co-polarized bands from both the imaging modes. However, further studies are necessary to test the potential of empirical modelling for correcting the theta for other different oceanic environments and SAR frequencies.

TI  - Investigation of hybrid polarimetric features for tsunami-induced damage assessment of urban areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a polarimetric scattering investigation was performed by using hybrid polarimetric (HP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to determine the optimum HP feature for urban damage assessment related to the Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster on 11 March 2011. To minimize the effect of uncertainty on the feature selection techniques, quantitative analysis of HP features derived from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phase Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data was conducted. First, preliminary selection was performed based on the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance, which was applied to evaluate the separability between damaged and undamaged areas. Second, random forest (RF) was implemented to improve the reliability and determine the most relevant feature based on importance score analysis. Accordingly, comparative analysis was performed and compared with quad polarimetric (QP) SAR data in terms of urban damage levels. The experimental results demonstrate that the circular polarization ratio is the most informative feature for the identification of urban damage and can be used to discriminate different damage levels, even in areas with large polarization orientation angle (POA).

TI  - A remotely sensed tracking of forest cover and associated temperature change in Margalla hills
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, forest degradation is a serious environmental issue, and in Pakistan, forest wealth is depleting at the highest rate in South Asia. To ensure sustainable development goals of environmental stewardship, social development and economic growth, a sound monitoring and regulatory mechanism is essential for tracking forest cover changes. This study aims to quantify the decline of forest reserves and associated temperature variations in a relatively unexplored biodiversity hotspot of Islamabad, Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). Imagery acquired by Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) for the year 1992, 2000 and 2011 are used to assess the spatial and temporal changes occurred over the last two decades (from 1992 to 2011). A robust hybrid-classification routine is implemented to monitor the changes in forest cover and ANOVA along with Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test is used to test the significance of temperature variation associated with a shift in land cover classes. The results showed a significant growth in settlements, agricultural area and barren soil whereas water body, lower vegetation, scrub and pine forest are diminishing. In both decades, the temperature alteration associated with a change in land cover classes are statistically significant (confirmed by ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests) for most of the land use/land cover classes. Based on these findings, this study concludes that forests are dwindling at MHNP and the degrading condition of the forest is below par and necessitates the promotion of conservation practices to minimize ecological disturbances.

TI  - Current practices for respiratory syncytial virus surveillance across the EU/EEA Member States, 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major contributor to lower respiratory tract infections worldwide and several vaccine candidates are currently in development. Following vaccine introduction, reliable RSV surveillance should enable monitoring of vaccination impact. Data on the RSV disease burden in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) are sparse. Aim: The aim of this study was to gather knowledge on current practices of national RSV surveillance in the EU/EEA. Methods: National Coordinators and National Focal Points for Influenza (epidemiologists and virologists) from the EU/EEA countries (n=31) were invited to participate in an online survey in August and September 2017. The questionnaire covered questions on epidemiological and laboratory aspects of RSV surveillance. Results: All EU/EEA countries except Liechtenstein replied to the survey. Eighteen countries reported to have a sentinel surveillance system, 26 countries a non-sentinel surveillance system and three countries to have neither. RSV data collection was mostly done within the context of influenza surveillance. A wide range of diagnostic and characterisation assays was used for the detection of RSV. Discussion: The majority of EU/ EEA countries have some surveillance for RSV in place. The prevailing integration of RSV surveillance into the existing influenza sentinel surveillance system may lead to under-reporting of RSV. The documented variations in existing RSV surveillance systems and their outputs indicate that there is scope for developing guidelines on establishing comparable methods and outcomes for RSV surveillance across the EU/EEA, to ensure the availability of a consistent evidence base for assessing future vaccination programmes.

TI  - Hybrid model to optimize object-based land cover classification by meta-heuristic algorithm: an example for supporting urban management in Ha Noi, Viet Nam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a novel object-based hybrid classification model named GMNN that combines Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and the multiple-class Neural network (MNN) for urban pattern detection in Hanoi, Vietnam. Four bands of SPOT 7 image and derivable NDVI, NDWI were used to generate image segments with associated attributes by PCI Geomatics software. These segments were classified into four urban surface types (namely water, impervious surface, vegetation and bare soil) by the proposed model. Alternatively, three training and validation datasets of different sizes were used to verify the robustness of this model. For all tests, the overall accuracies of the classification were approximately 87%, and the Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for each land cover type was 0.97. Also, the performance of this model was examined by comparing several statistical indicators with common benchmark classifiers. The results showed that GMNN out-performed established methods in all comparable indicators. These results suggested that our hybrid model was successfully deployed in the study area and could be used as an alternative classification method for urban land cover studies. In a broader sense, classification methods will be enriched with the active and fast-growing contribution of metaheuristic algorithms.

TI  - Principal polar spectral indices for mapping mangroves forest in South East Asia: study case Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and monitoring of species composition and richness is needed to formulate effective mangrove management and conservation priorities. Prior studies have used commercial satellite images which are cost prohibitive for national and global applications. Here, we used freely available Landsat satellite data and new indices to discriminate mangrove species in Maros Regency, South Sulawesi, Indonesia and Segara Anakan, West Java, Indonesia. We use sensitive algorithm of the principal polar spectral (PPS) indices to discriminate mangroves species. PPS Indices were produced from a set of 3-dimensional Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral indices (PPS Brightness, PPS Greenness, and PPS Wetness) determined by a polar change of the principal component axes of a spectral image of reference scene. We qualitatively compare this set of PPS indices with the set of conventional RGB multi-bands image composition and conventional Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) for mangroves species discrimination. The comparisons indicate that the set of PPS indices have the potential for regional and possibly global applications in mangroves species mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Globally standardized MODIS spectral mixture models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Standardized substrate, vegetation, and dark (S, V, & D) spectral endmembers (EMs) are presented for spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of MODIS version 6 daily nadir looking BRDF-adjusted reflectance (daily NBAR). EMs are derived from a diverse collection of over 43,000,000MODIS spectra spanning 6 continents and all non-polar biomes. EM spectra are similar to those from decametre studies. Sensitivity analysis using 351 pairs of 27 EM combinations shows mean differences in SVD fraction estimates of 4 +/- 3%, 3 +/- 2%, and 3 +/- 2%, respectively. An additional snow EM is identified, but deemed tentative pending further cryospheric analysis. Vicarious validation with Landsat shows under 0.5% bias in V fraction, -7% and +11% biases in S and D fractions, and comparable dispersion (standard deviation 6% to 7%) in all fractions. Model misfit is low (root-mean-square error under 5% for 99.9% pixels). When V is compared to Normalized Difference, Enhanced, and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI), NDVI shows over twice the dispersion (standard deviation 29% vs 13-14%) and over 4 times the bias (+18% vs 4%) of EVI and SAVI. Combined with previous studies, these results extend the scaling linearity and low misfit of the global SVD linear mixture model from 2m up to 500m.

TI  - Generating a long-term data series of burned area in Eastern Siberia using LTDR data (1984-2016)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of burned area (BA) mapping in Eastern Siberian forests using Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR) project data. A combined approach that includes an expert assessment of BAs detected by threshold algorithm is proposed. Comparison with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product (MCD64A1 C6, 2001-2016) and Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) v.4 data (1995-2016) showed good agreement with correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.93 with average relative errors 16.5% and 40.6%, respectively. It is concluded that the use of a combined approach based on expert assessment with additional conditions provides a higher (compared to fully automated algorithms) level of confidence in BA detection, especially over areas with mountainous terrain, complex ground surface texture, vegetation type and/or over areas located at high latitudes, where the occurrence of wildfires is extremely unlikely.

TI  - Failure of sentinel lymph node mapping in a patient with endometrial cancer with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to report a detection failure of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping via indocyanine green in a patient with endometrial cancer with a previous history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a potential risk factor to obstruct lymphatic channels. A 64-year-old woman with a 12-year history of CLL presented to the clinic with grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic surgical staging. Indocyanine green was used intraoperatively to locate the SLN. No lymph node or lymphatic vessels were identified during SLN mapping. At the final pathology, the morphological findings of CLL were detected in the lymph nodes without metastasis of endometrial cancer. Sentinel lymph node mapping failure due to obstruction of lymphatic channels in a patient with CLL was demonstrated in this study. This is the first report to the best of our knowledge showing SLN mapping failure in the presence of lymphoproliferative diseases.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, the integration of remotely sensed data and Cellular Automata-Markov model (CA-Markov) have been used to analyze the dynamics of land use change and its prediction for the next year. Training phase for the CA-Markov model has been created based on the input pair of land use, which is the result of land use mapping using Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm. Three-map comparison has been used to evaluate process accuracy assessment of the training phase for the CA-Markov model. Furthermore, the simulation phase for the CA-Markov model can be used to predict land use map for the next year. The analyze of the dynamics of land use change and its prediction during the period 1990 to 2050 can be obtained that the land serves as a water absorbent surfaces such as primary forest, secondary forest and the mixed garden area continued to decline. Meanwhile, on build land area that can lead to reduced surface water absorbing tends to increase from year to year. The results of this research can be used as input for the next research, which aims to determine the impact of land use changes in hydrological conditions against flooding in the research area.

TI  - A generalized supervised classification scheme to produce provincial wetland inventory maps: an application of Google Earth Engine for big geo data processing
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important natural resources due to their numerous ecological services. Consequently, identifying their locations and extents is imperative. The stability, repeatability, cost-effectiveness, multi-scale coverage, and proper spatial resolution imagery of satellites provide a valuable opportunity for their use in various large-scale applications, such as provincial wetland mapping. To do so, it is required to (1) process and classify big geo data (i.e. a large amount of satellite datasets) in a time- and computationally-efficient approach and (2) collect a large amount of field samples. In this study, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning algorithms were utilized to process thousands of remote sensing images and produce provincial wetland inventory maps of the three Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). Additionally, using GEE, a generalized supervised classification method is proposed to produce a regional wetland map from a large area (e.g., a province) when lacking field samples. In fact, using the field data from only Manitoba and assuming that all wetlands in Canada have similar characteristics, the wetland maps were generated for the other two provinces. The overall classification accuracies for Manitoba, Quebec, and NL were 84%, 78%, and 82%, respectively, indicating the high potential of the proposed method for aiding provincial wetland inventory systems.

TI  - Linking spatial patterns of terrestrial herbivore community structure to trophic interactions
T2  - ELIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large herbivores influence ecosystem functioning via their effects on vegetation at different spatial scales. It is often overlooked that the spatial distribution of large herbivores results from their responses to interacting top-down and bottom-up ecological gradients that create landscape-scale variation in the structure of the entire community. We studied the complexity of these cascading interactions using high-resolution camera trapping and remote sensing data in the best-preserved European lowland forest, Bialowieia Forest, Poland. We showed that the variation in spatial distribution of an entire community of large herbivores is explained by species-specific responses to both environmental bottom-up and biotic top-down factors in combination with human-induced (cascading) effects. We decomposed the spatial variation in herbivore community structure and identified functionally distinct landscape-scale herbivory regimes ('herbiscapes'), which are predicted to occur in a variety of ecosystems and could be an important mechanism creating spatial variation in herbivory maintaining vegetation heterogeneity.

TI  - Peat swamp forest conservation withstands pervasive land conversion to oil palm plantation in North Selangor, Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical deforestation remains one of the major global challenges of the twenty-first century driven to a large extent by the conversion of land for agricultural purposes, such as palm oil production. Malaysia is one of the world's largest palm oil producers and has seen widespread conversion to oil palm from primary forest, including peat swamp forest (PSF). This study investigates the rate and extent of pervasive oil palm expansion in and around North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF) over the last three decades, exploring how land conversion has affected the region's tropical forests, and assessing the relative success of PSF conservation measures. Time-series Landsat imagery was used to assess thematic land cover change and improvement in vegetation condition since NSPSF was given protected status in 1990. The results show a near tripling in oil palm cover throughout North Selangor, from 24,930ha in 1989 to 70,070ha in 2016; while at the same time tropical forest cover shrank from 145,570ha to 88,400ha. Despite concerns over the sustainability and environmental impact of such rapid oil palm conversion at a regional level, at the local scale, NSPSF represents a relative conservation success story. Effective land stewardship by government and non-governmental organization (NGO) management actors has limited illegal encroachment of oil palm around the reserve boundary. PSF rehabilitation measures have also markedly improved vegetation condition in NSPFS's interior. These findings have broad significance for how oil palm agriculture is managed and especially for PSF stewardship and conservation, and the approaches described here may be usefully adopted elsewhere in Southeast Asia and around the world.

TI  - Mapping oil palm plantation expansion in Malaysia over the past decade (2007-2016) using ALOS-1/2 PALSAR-1/2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaysia is one of the major oil palm producing regions in the world, with rapid growth over recent decades. While this expansion has boosted socio-economic development, it has also caused severe ecological problems: deforestation and the use of fire to clear secondary forest have damaged the balance of regional ecosystems and the carbon cycle. In this study, oil palm mapping in Malaysia over the past decade (2007-2016) was produced annually, using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-1 Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR)-1 (2007-2010) images and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (2015 and 2016) images at 100 m resolution with maximum likelihood classifier-based supervised classification. Two independent verification systems (testing samples and Malaysian Palm Oil Board statistics) were used to evaluate the mapping accuracy. The average overall accuracy for the six years was 94.62% and the accuracy of oil palm mapping was greater than 83%. The results show the dynamics of oil palm distribution from 2007 to 2016. Two approaches (i.e. pixel counting (PC) and error matrix-based model-assisted (EM)) were used to estimate the oil palm area from the maps. In total, over the past decade, the Malaysian oil palm area increased by 69.25% from 4.00 million ha (Mha) in 2007 to 6.77 in 2016 with PC method (EM method increased by 85.76% +/- 15.36%, from 3.73 +/- 0.19 Mha in 2007 to 6.90 +/- 0.22 Mha), with an annual average increase of 6.93% (EM: 8.58% +/- 1.54). This exceeds the MPOB estimates of growth from 5.00 Mha in 2011 to 5.74 Mha in 2016, an annual average increase of 2.47%. For the oil palm plantations mapping in the whole Malaysia, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm outperformed Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) in terms of mapping accuracy and computation cost.

TI  - Detection and characterization of oil palm plantations through MODIS EVI time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm is a perennial tree that well fits the humid tropical climate; fresh fruit bunchesare the palm raw fruit for oil mills. Palm oil is the world highest yielding oil crop determining that palms are extensively planted in South-East Asia, especially in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia where plantations have been spreading in response to the increasing market demand. Cultivation of oil palm in tropical countries is an important economic factor, but it has already proved of endangering biodiversity and degrading environment with a global impact related to forest loss. Remote sensing well fits requirements of precision farming that many stakeholders involved in palm oil production are currently approaching to decrease or monitor environmental impacts. In this work, an enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series of 415 images was obtained from the MODIS Vegetation Index 16 days composite product (MOD13Q1-v5) to explore tropical vegetation changes. The EVI time series covers a period of 18 years; it was processed aiming at mapping new oil palm plantations in the reference period, giving an estimate of their age, production, and economic value. In this work, a new methodology for oil palm detection and characterization was presented based on local EVI temporal profile analysis. Pixel EVI temporal profile proved to be effective in describing both vegetation macro-phenology and forest loss at that position. Consequently, the proposed algorithm looks for abrupt changes along the local EVI time series (sudden decreasing). The minimum EVI value recorded in the detected changing period is assumed as a predictor of the starting date of new plantations, being the latter reasonably related to forest loss and preliminary soil preparation. Starting date is then used by the algorithm to estimate oil palm age and, consequently, the present local (potential) production. Accuracy assessment showed an overall accuracy in new palm oil plantation detection of about 94%. Starting age estimation proved to be accurate enough: 76% of the estimates, in fact, were placed in a range of uncertainty of 1 year.

TI  - Cooling Effect of Paddy on Land Surface Temperature in Cold China Based on MODIS Data: A Case Study in Northern Sanjiang Plain
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast-growing crops have been evolved in North China, accompanied by intense paddy expansion, leading to dramatic impacts on the agricultural environment. Among these environmental issues, the impact of paddy expansion on land surface temperature is still unclear. In the present study, based on Landsat images and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products, the crop pattern and monthly LST in the northern Sanjiang Plain are obtained. A 1 km scale grid unit is built to investigate the relationship between LST and paddy expansion. The results obtained from the study are as follows. Firstly, for crop patterns, cropland planting is given priority to paddy fields, accompanied by an aggregated pattern, while upland crops present a discrete pattern. Secondly, for LST changes during the growing season, the maximum LST occurs in June, and the lowest values occur in October across the whole region. In addition, the LST of paddy fields is lower compared with that of upland crops for the whole growing season. Thirdly, at the 1 km grid scale, the relationship between monthly LST and paddy field ratio is significantly negative, and better represented by a cubic function rather than a linear fit. Finally, LST decreases with the increased fraction of the rice paddy area more rapidly when rice paddy is aggregated and accounted for by more than 80% of each study grid. The findings of this study are important to guide agricultural production and to better understand the environmental effects of paddy expansion in cold regions.

TI  - Oil palm dry season analysis based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm is the most important crop in Malaysia. It plays a key role in maintaining carbon balance and it possesses high economic value. However, oil palm productivity is really sensitive to environmental changes especially during the long-term dry season. This has warranted studies on frequent observation of dry season for the plantation of oil palm. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data were utilized to generate an index for the crop assessment at Felcra Mendom Oil Plantation area, Negeri Sembilan. The indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and shortwave indices, namely Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index (SWISI), at three different channels of 2, 5, and 6 were utilized. The main aim is to identify drought year based on MODIS-SPI-based index calculated and evaluated indices developed from MODIS images. The precipitation data retrieved from Malaysia Meteorology Department starting from year 1997 until 2017 and later are classified using Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). Then by using the data from precipitation and SPI, the MODIS images were extracted from Land Process Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Next, the images were processed and analysed by using ENVI Version 5.3 software to extract the indices used. The SPI-3 and SPI-1 were classified year 2015 as extreme drought with extreme' and mild', respectively. Meanwhile, the vegetation indices were calculated and average showed both NDVI and EVI approaching +1.00 value at the highest NDVI is 0.79 during 2017 and the highest EVI is 0.62 during years 2005 and 2013, respectively. Both SIWSI showed similar pattern, indicating high-moisture content as the index approaching -1.00. The result does not represent the overall condition of the specific study area, but the SPI is reliable to display the whole area and the utilization of MODIS and SPI can be used in further study.

TI  - Identification and temporally-spatial quantification of geomorphic relevant changes by construction projects in loess landscapes: case study Lanzhou City, NW China
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development of urban areas demands, among others, a holistic approach for identification and monitoring of environmental changes caused by human activities. In this study, the human-made impact on the geo-environment is studied through the application of the change detection study based on Principal Component Analysis on Landsat imageries and comparison of the digital elevation models taken at different times. The analysis is set up to identify and quantify the anthropogenic geomorphological changes in the loess landscape in Lanzhou city, Northwest China. Since 2002 Lanzhou has been undergoing a rapid economic development associated with construction boom. Due to limited flat building ground in the narrowed Yellow River Valley and subsequent expansion into the surrounding loess mountains, massive earthworks are conducted for reclamation of the suitable building ground. The results of the change detection analysis show that approximately 10% of the semi-natural study area corresponding to 35 km(2) has been reshaped by leveling and terracing since 1994. In particular, the geomorphology was significantly changed in these and adjacent areas. For the single developing area Taipingyang, a moving volume of up to 57 million m(3) was roughly estimated.

TI  - TROPOMI/S5P total ozone column data: global ground-based validation and consistency with other satellite missions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In October 2017, the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission was launched, carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which provides a daily global coverage at a spatial resolution as high as 7 km x 3.5 km and is expected to extend the European atmospheric composition record initiated with GOME/ERS-2 in 1995, enhancing our scientific knowledge of atmospheric processes with its unprecedented spatial resolution. Due to the ongoing need to understand and monitor the recovery of the ozone layer, as well as the evolution of tropospheric pollution, total ozone remains one of the leading species of interest during this mission.In this work, the TROPOMI near real time (NRTI) and offline (OFFL) total ozone column (TOC) products are presented and compared to daily ground-based quality-assured Brewer and Dobson TOC measurements deposited in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Additional comparisons to individual Brewer measurements from the Canadian Brewer Network and the European Brewer Network (Eubrewnet) are performed. Furthermore, twilight zenith-sky measurements obtained with ZSL-DOAS (Zenith Scattered Light Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) instruments, which form part of the SAOZ network (Systeme d'Analyse par Observation Zenitale), are used for the validation. The quality of the TROPOMI TOC data is evaluated in terms of the influence of location, solar zenith angle, viewing angle, season, effective temperature, surface albedo and clouds. For this purpose, globally distributed ground-based measurements have been utilized as the background truth. The overall statistical analysis of the global comparison shows that the mean bias and the mean standard deviation of the percentage difference between TROPOMI and ground-based TOC is within 0-1.5% and 2.5 %-4.5 %, respectively. The mean bias that results from the comparisons is well within the S5P product requirements, while the mean standard deviation is very close to those limits, especially considering that the statistics shown here originate both from the satellite and the ground-based measurements.Additionally, the TROPOMI OFFL and NRTI products are evaluated against already known spaceborne sensors, namely, the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite, on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (OMPS/Suomi-NPP), NASA v2 TOCs, and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2), on board the Metop-A (GOME-2/Metop-A) and Metop-B (GOME-2/Metop-B) satellites. This analysis shows a very good agreement for both TROPOMI products with well-established instruments, with the absolute differences in mean bias and mean standard deviation being below +0.7% and 1 %, respectively. These results assure the scientific community of the good quality of the TROPOMI TOC products during its first year of operation and enhance the already prevalent expectation that TROPOMI/S5P will play a very significant role in the continuity of ozone monitoring from space.

TI  - A comparative assessment of adult mosquito trapping methods to estimate spatial patterns of abundance and community composition in southern Africa
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Assessing adult mosquito populations is an important component of disease surveillance programs and ecosystem health assessments. Inference from adult trapping datasets involves comparing populations across space and time, but comparisons based on different trapping methods may be biased if traps have different efficiencies or sample different subsets of the mosquito community.Methods: We compared four widely-used trapping methods for adult mosquito data collection in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa: Centers for Disease Control miniature light trap (CDC), Biogents Sentinel trap (BG), Biogents gravid Aedes trap (GAT) and a net trap. We quantified how trap choice and sampling effort influence inferences on the regional distribution of mosquito abundance, richness and community composition.Results: The CDC and net traps together collected 96% (47% and 49% individually) of the 955 female mosquitoes sampled and 100% (85% and 78% individually) of the 40 species or species complexes identified. The CDC and net trap also identified similar regional patterns of community composition. However, inference on the regional patterns of abundance differed between these traps because mosquito abundance in the net trap was influenced by variation in weather conditions. The BG and GAT traps collected significantly fewer mosquitoes, limiting regional comparisons of abundance and community composition.Conclusions: This study represents the first systematic assessment of trapping methods in natural savanna ecosystems in southern Africa. We recommend the CDC trap or the net trap for future monitoring and surveillance programs.

TI  - Assessing pupils' attitudes towards religious and worldview diversity - development and validation of a nuanced measurement instrument
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we outline the development and validation of an instrument for the assessment of attitudes towards religious diversity. The instrument uses four parallel scales, which evaluate attitudes towards Muslims, Christians, Jews and towards Non-religious people. Each scale is subdivided into eight parallel profile types and tests for the acceptance of six levels of social proximity. Drawing on a sample of 281 respondents (which include Muslims, Christians, Jews, Non-religious and Other) and employing the item response theory, we examine the reliability and validity of the instrument and present first results. We found that respondents discriminated greatly between the eight profile types and made clear distinctions with regard to the proximity of social relationships. Relative to these distinctions within each religion, differences between the four groups Muslims, Christians, Jews and Non-religious appeared minimal. These findings suggest that the results of previous research which indicate scepticism towards Islam despite general respect for religious diversity could be due to stereotyping.

TI  - Benchmarking the Indian National CartoDEM against SRTM for 1D hydraulic modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forecasts are a necessity in a world with frequent flood disasters and climatic anomalies. Studies have demonstrated that one of the primary sources of uncertainty in flood modelling is the topographic input data, the bathymetry in particular. As high-resolution elevation/bathymetry datasets are often unavailable in developing regions, the present study benchmarks the freely available Indian National Digital Elevation Model (DEM) CartoDEM, against the currently preferred global DEM, SRTM, for 1D-hydrodynamic modelling. Techniques for improving simulated Water Surface Elevation (WSE) profiles, while using cross-sections derived from these free DEMs are proposed. A distributed vertical error characterization using ground surveyed control points was performed and used to correct the DEM-extracted cross-sections. The approach was tested by simulating a 25-year return period flood in a reach of the Erai River, near Chandrapur city in Maharashtra, India. The results show an improvement of ?84% in the root-mean-squared-error value for the WSE generated by the SRTM after correction, while the CartoDEM degraded by ?41%. It was observed that while the uncorrected CartoDEM performs better than the uncorrected SRTM, the converse is true after the bias correction.

TI  - An Automatic Stationary Water Color Parameters Observation System for Shallow Waters: Designment and Applications
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of the above-water spectrum and concerned water color parameters (WCPs) are crucial for research and applications in water environment remote sensing. Due to the lack of system integration and automatization, conventional methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to subjective influences. To obtain a highly accurate and long-term consistent spectrum and concurrent WCPs (Chl-a (chlorophyll-a), turbidity, and CDOM (Colored Dissolved Organic Matter)) data with a relatively low cost, an Automatic Stationary Water Color Parameters Observation System (AFWCPOS) was developed. Controlled by an automatic platform, the spectral and WCPs data were collected by TriOS RAMSES hyperspectral spectroradiometers and WETLabs ECO (Environmental Characterization Optics) fluorometers following the measurement protocol. Experiment and initial validations of AFWCPOS were carried out in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, from 20 to 28 July 2013. Results proved that the spectral data from AFWCPOS were highly consistent with the commonly used portable SVC (Spectra Vista Corporation) HR-1024 field spectroradiometer, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.96, unbiased percent difference (UPD) of 0.14, and mean relative difference (MRD) of 0.078. With advantages of continuous and high degrees of automation monitoring, the AFWCPOS has great potential in capture diurnal and inter-diurnal variations in the test site of Poyang Lake, as well as another high-dynamic shallow coastal and inland waters, which will benefit routine water quality monitoring with high quality and high-frequency time-series observations. In addition, a successful case based on Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) image and in-situ data collected by AFWCPOS showed it's potential in remote sensing applications. The spatial distribution of Chl-a, turbidity, and CDOM were mapped, which were explainable and similar to previous researches. These results showed our system was able to obtain reliable and valuable data for water environment monitoring.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in basal melting at Nivlisen ice shelf, East Antarctica, derived from phase-sensitive radars
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thinning rates of ice shelves vary widely around Antarctica, and basal melting is a major component of ice shelf mass loss. In this study, we present records of basal melting at a unique spatial and temporal resolution for East Antarctica, derived from autonomous phase-sensitive radars. These records show spatial and temporal variations of basal melting in 2017 and 2018 at Nivlisen, an ice shelf in central Dronning Maud Land. The annually averaged basal melt rates are in general moderate (similar to 0.8 m yr(-1)). Radar profiling of the ice shelf shows variable ice thickness from smooth beds to basal crevasses and channels. The highest basal melt rates (3.9 m yr(-1)) were observed close to a grounded feature near the ice shelf front. Daily time-varying measurements reveal a seasonal melt signal 4 km from the ice shelf front, at an ice draft of 130 m, where the highest daily basal melt rates occurred in summer (up to 5.6 m yr(-1)). In comparison with wind, air temperatures, and sea ice cover from reanalysis and satellite data, the seasonality in basal melt rates indicates that summer-warmed ocean surface water was pushed by wind beneath the ice shelf front. We observed a different melt regime 35 km into the ice shelf cavity, at an ice draft of 280 m, with considerably lower basal melt rates (annual average of 0.4 m yr(-1)) and no seasonality. We conclude that warm deep-ocean water at present has a limited effect on the basal melting of Nivlisen. On the other hand, a warming in surface waters, as a result of diminishing sea ice cover, has the potential to increase basal melting near the ice shelf front. Continuous in situ monitoring of Antarctic ice shelves is needed to understand the complex mechanisms involved in ice shelf-ocean interactions.

TI  - Efficient Parameter Estimation for Sparse SAR Imaging Based on Complex Image and Azimuth-Range Decouple
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse signal processing theory has been applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. In compressive sensing (CS), the sparsity is usually considered as a known parameter. However, it is unknown practically. For many functions of CS, we need to know this parameter. Therefore, the estimation of sparsity is crucial for sparse SAR imaging. The sparsity is determined by the size of regularization parameter. Several methods have been presented for automatically estimating the regularization parameter, and have been applied to sparse SAR imaging. However, these methods are deduced based on an observation matrix, which will entail huge computational and memory costs. In this paper, to enhance the computational efficiency, an efficient adaptive parameter estimation method for sparse SAR imaging is proposed. The complex image-based sparse SAR imaging method only considers the threshold operation of the complex image, which can reduce the computational costs significantly. By utilizing this feature, the parameter is pre-estimated based on a complex image. In order to estimate the sparsity accurately, adaptive parameter estimation is then processed in the raw data domain, combining with the pre-estimated parameter and azimuth-range decouple operators. The proposed method can reduce the computational complexity from a quadratic square order to a linear logarithm order, which can be used in the large-scale scene. Simulated and Gaofen-3 SAR data processing results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

TI  - Discriminating between large-scale oil palm plantations and smallholdings on tropical peatlands using vegetation indices and supervised classification of LANDSAT-8
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forest is rapidly being converted into industrial-scale oil palm agriculture across South-east Asia. This has global and local environmental implications including habitat loss and carbon release. Monitoring oil palm expansion or land-use/land-cover on peatlands is feasible using remote sensing technology, however, there are few examples of assessments of different oil palm management systems. Three peatland land cover types were assessed and mapped using vegetation indices and supervised classifications of Landsat-8 level-2 imagery: peat swamp forest, large-scale oil palm plantation and smallholding. Firstly, we calculated and compared differences in vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI and SAVI) values between each of the land covers. Next, we mapped land cover using three classification methods - Support Vector Machine, Random Trees and Maximum Likelihood - with a single date and multi-temporal datasets. These were applied to the vegetation indices and also a three band Landsat image using band 2 (blue band), band 4 (red band) and band 5 (near-infrared band) i.e. false colour composite. The vegetation index assessment found significant differences in the NDVI, EVI and SAVI between peat swamp forest, large-scale plantation and smallholding. The NDVI in peat swamp forest was highest. In contrast, the EVI and SAVI in the peat swamp forest were the lowest. While the NDVI, EVI and SAVI in the large-scale plantations were greater than the smallholdings. Irrespective of landscape type, there were strong positive correlations between NDVI and EVI, NDVI and SAVI, and EVI and SAVI. For the land cover mapping, the best classifier was Random Trees with the multi-temporal Landsat bands 543 datasets with a mapping accuracy of 95.54% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.933. This study demonstrated that both vegetation indices and land cover mapping can provide planners and decision-makers with tools to monitor natural and production landscapes, managed under different systems in the tropics.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying and interpreting variability in ecological systems allows us to better understand the driving forces that determine ecosystems functioning. We utilised earth observation-based remote sensing to determine total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations for 109 lakes over 16 years. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to quantify variability of TSS at three temporal scales (monthly, annual and long-term) and at the horizontal spatial scale. CV values varied between 0.14 and 1.09. Drivers of observed variability patterns were explored using five lake morphological and catchment characteristics. Lake area was the most important variable to predict variability of TSS. De-vegetated lakes displayed significantly higher TSS concentrations than vegetated lakes; however, aquatic vegetation was found to moderate only spatial variability of TSS. As spatio-temporal variability can be assumed to drive key ecosystem functions, determining characteristic variability patterns for various attributes should be a prerequisite when setting management goals and developing monitoring regimes.

TI  - Adventures in Language: Yoko Tawada's Exophonic Explorations of German
T2  - OXFORD GERMAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Yoko Tawada (1960) is for good reasons one of the prime examples of contemporary German exophonic literature. She is a very successful writer in Japanese and in German and provides in her Germanophone writings an ethnography of the German Weltansicht, as Wilhelm von Humboldt famously called languages, or of the German language mindset. This article focuses on her poetry volume of 2010, Abenteuer der deutschen Grammatik, to demonstrate how exophonia can bring us to develop an acute awareness of the ways language structures shape our patterns of thinking. Coming from a very differently organised language, Japanese, Tawada comments in playful ways on the implications of German, and compares it to Japanese. This enables her to be very creative and to make Germans see their language with new eyes. Translingual writing, even though also present in a real mixing of languages in Tawada, appears here as a way to understand how much our ideas are shaped by our linguistic structures, and that there are alternative world views. It thus contributes greatly to a relativization of one's own perspective and helps to open up to difference and creativity.

TI  - Near real-time deforestation detection in Malaysia and Indonesia using change vector analysis with three sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaysia and Indonesia have been affected by deforestation caused in great part by the proliferation of oil palm plantations. To survey this loss of forest, several studies have monitored these southeast Asian nations with satellite remote sensing alert systems. The methods used have shown potential for this approach, but they are limited by imagery with coarse spatial resolution, low revisit times, and cloud cover. The objective of this research is to improve near real-time operational deforestation detection by combining three sensors: Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. We used Change Vector Analysis to detect changes between non-affected forest and images under analysis. The results were validated using 166 plots of undisturbed forest and confirmed deforestation events throughout Sabah Malaysian State, and from 70 points from drone pictures in Sumatra, Indonesia. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 yielded sufficient results in terms of accuracy (less than 11% of commission and omission error). Sentinel-1 had lower accuracy (14% of commission error and 28% of omission error), probably resulting from geometric distortions and speckle noise. During the high cloud-cover season optical sensors took about twice the time to detect deforestation compared to Sentinel-1 which was not affected by cloud cover. By combining the three sensors, we detected deforestations about 8days after forest clearing events. Deforestations were only detectable during approximately the first 100days, before bare soils were often coved by legume crop. Our results indicate that near real-time deforestation detection can reveal most events, but the number of false detections could be improved using a multiple event detection process.

TI  - CART-RF Classification with Multifilter for Monitoring Land Use Changes Based on MODIS Time-Series Data: A Case Study from Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The periodic determination of land use changes over large areas is crucial for improving our understanding of land system dynamics. Jiangsu lies at the center of China's Yangtze Delta and has one of the fastest-developing economies in China. However, it is also a region where serious conflicts exist between the available land resources and the human demand for land. To address these conflicts, it is important to analyze the patterns of land use change in Jiangsu, as they can serve as a useful reference for other rapidly urbanizing regions in China as well as other developing countries. In this study, we propose a method of classification and regression tree-random forest (CART-RF) classification with a multifilter based on time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imaging data. The proposed method integrates the CART decision tree and the random forest algorithms (CART-RF) to obtain accurate yearly land use data for large areas from multivariate time-series remote sensing data and employs a spatial-temporal-logical filter to exclude any abnormal changes in the multivariate time-series pixel data. The obtained results indicated that (1) the CART-RF classifier is effective for land use classification based on the multivariate time-series MODIS data, with the overall classification accuracy being greater than 90%; (2) the use of the proposed combinatorial spatial-temporal-logical filtering method effectively eliminates most anomalous changes and minimizes the effects of "salt-and-pepper" noise; and (3) from 2000 to 2015, land use in Jiangsu province underwent significant and spatiotemporally heterogeneous changes on a province-wide scale, owing to various factors, such as those related to the economy, location, and government policies. These changes were manifested as continuous expansions in the built-up land at the expense of farmland. While this expansion of built-up land has been very rapid in southern Jiangsu, especially in the region close to Yangtze River Delta, it has been relatively slower in northern Jiangsu.

AB  - Tropical forest is important in tackling global climate change. However, large-scale transformation of tropical forest in Indonesia is being done for oil palm plantation. Till date, there is a lack of scientific documentation that shows the most recent situation of oil palm plantation in the most eastern part of the country. This study documents the real condition of oil palm plantation expansion based on Sentinel data of European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel-1 data sets of Papua Provinces of the year 2017 acquisition are used to avoid cloud cover problems in tropical regions. Object-based geospatial data feature extraction with Polarimetric SAR compared to the multiple classifier methods (that is, Gaussian Mixture Method, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors) were introduced and employed using GRASS & QGIS of free open source software (FOSS). Google Earth Engine (GEE) was then used to verify the classification result of oil palm plantation. The preprocessing step is very crucial in achieving high accuracy. However, it is time-consuming. This study concluded that the proposed method and SVM classifiers achieved the highest accuracy, 99.7% and 99.12%, respectively. While the KNN, RF, and GMM classifier produced 94.63%, 89.06%, and 72.87%, respectively. We found that vast scale transformation of tropical rainforest in lowland areas is happening in eastern Indonesia. This situation should be strictly monitored and controlled to avoid more significant issues related to socio-economic-environmental implications.

TI  - Dealing with worldviews in religious education Thematic analysis on the topical structure of German RE

CP  - Biennial Conference of European-Association-of-Learning-and-Instruction-Special-Interest-Group-19-Religions-and-Worldviews-in-Education
CL  - Joensuu, FINLAND
AB  - The primary goal of religious education (RE) in Germany is to enable students to develop a personal worldview. According to the literature, this goal can best be achieved when RE a) presents material from various worldviews and b) relates this material to the student?s daily life. Denominational RE, which is the organisational format of this subject in Germany, may fail to meet these requirements because it may tend to focus on the organised worldview of the relevant religious tradition as the preferred worldview for adoption by students. Motivated by the lack of relevant empirical studies, this paper offers initial insight into the issue by answering the question of how German denominational RE organises its themes. On the basis of a German case study, it maps the topical structure of teaching units (N = 15, comprising 116 lessons) by thematic analysis. The results indicate that RE in the German denominational context predominantly addresses its own denominational issues. Alternative perspectives of the unit?s topic, the students? personal perceptions, and references to the students? lifeworld are primarily used to better facilitate the students? comprehension of these denominational issues. Only two units present a variety of worldviews as real alternatives to denominational perspectives.

TI  - An associational study on pre-service early childhood teachers' nature relatedness in education for sustainability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is significant global concern with current environmental problems, yet people's behaviour towards the environment has been resistant to change. Young people have the opportunity to bring about desirable changes through environmental behaviours and attitudes. The goal of this study is to better understand the scope of nature relatedness as an attribution interacting with pro-environmental behaviours for Turkish pre-service early childhood teachers. We examined the associations between the domains representing nature relatedness and also sought to identify any differences in nature relatedness with respect to their year of enrolment in a teacher education program. The participants were 402 students attending an Early Childhood Teacher Education Program at one of the two public universities in the capital of Turkey. A Turkish-adapted version of the Nature Relatedness Scale developed by Nisbet, Zelenski, and Murphy was administered to gather the data. Participants were found to have a mostly positive external nature-related worldview. Furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated non-significant differences in their nature relatedness with respect to the year of enrolment in the teacher education program. In terms of the relationships between the constructs representing nature relatedness, the internalized identification with nature was positively correlated with two constructs which refer to his/her physical familiarity as well as attraction to nature, and how individual's relationship with the environment is provoked by his/her behaviour. This research indicates that pre-service teachers, who are regarded as important agents for the future implementation of sustainability education, are actually lacking in their nature relatedness constructs and need to develop key competencies in a field that presupposes that they have already acquired sufficient experience of physical and emotional interaction with nature.

TI  - Classifying the severity of basal stem rot disease in oil palm plantations using WorldView-3 imagery and machine learning algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Basal stem rot (BSR) disease caused by Ganoderma boninense is a major disease in oil palm plantations and there is no effective fungicide to control this disease. Several researchers have applied remote sensing for BSR studies, but, until now, WorldView-3 imagery has not been used to classify the severity of BSR disease symptoms. The objectives of this study were to predict disease severity with WorldView-3 imagery using supervised learning algorithms, and to describe the characteristic symptoms of BSR disease in oil palm at different disease severity levels that can be identified by WorldView-3 imagery. Field observation data were collected for 1923 oil palm trees with various levels of infection, namely healthy trees, and unhealthy trees with three levels of symptoms from mild to severe. Decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine learning algorithms were applied. The overall accuracy was low, but the accuracy was improved by about 1%-5% after outliers were removed from the data. Outliers were removed based on box plots of the distribution of reflectance value of band 4. Band 4 was selected by Jeffries-Matusita distance analysis and stepclass' algorithm. The separation of four levels of BSR disease described in this study was affected by the criteria used to describe the BSR disease symptoms in the field observation step. A redefined method and new criteria for BSR disease symptoms that can be identify using WorldView-3 imagery are described.

TI  - Multi-Scale Estimation of Land Use Efficiency (SDG 11.3.1) across 25 Years Using Global Open and Free Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aspires to "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable", and the introduction of an explicit urban goal testifies to the importance of urbanisation. The understanding of the process of urbanisation and the capacity to monitor the SDGs require a wealth of open, reliable, locally yet globally comparable data, and a fully-fledged data revolution. In this framework, the European Commission-Joint Research Centre has developed a suite of (open and free) data and tools named Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) which maps the human presence on Earth (built-up areas, population distribution and settlement typologies) between 1975 and 2015. The GHSL supplies information on the progressive expansion of built-up areas on Earth and population dynamics in human settlements, with both sources of information serving as baseline data to quantify land use efficiency (LUE), listed as a Tier II indicator for SDG 11 (11.3.1). In this paper, we present the profile of the LUE across several territorial scales between 1990 and 2015, highlighting diverse development trajectories and the land take efficiency of different human settlements. Our results show that (i) the GHSL framework allows us to estimate LUE for the entire planet at several territorial scales, opening the opportunity of lifting the LUE indicator from its Tier II classification; (ii) the current formulation of the LUE is substantially subject to path dependency; and (iii) it requires additional spatially-explicit metrics for its interpretation. We propose the Achieved Population Density in Expansion Areas and the Marginal Land Consumption per New Inhabitant metrics for this purpose. The study is planetary and multi-temporal in coverage, demonstrating the value of well-designed, open and free, fine-scale geospatial information on human settlements in supporting policy and monitoring progress made towards meeting the SDGs.

TI  - County-Level Soybean Yield Prediction Using Deep CNN-LSTM Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield prediction is of great significance for yield mapping, crop market planning, crop insurance, and harvest management. Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future.

TI  - Suitability mapping for rice cultivation in Benue State, Nigeria using satellite data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With rising population, decline in soil productivity and land-based conflicts, the per-capita land availability for cultivation is rapidly decreasing within Benue State, a largely agrarian and small-holder setting. This study attempts a local-level support for the actualisation of Sustainable Development Goal Number 2 ("end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture") by 2030. Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, remote sensing data from Climate Research Unit (CRU) and in-situ data from Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) were analyzed by GIS techniques to map the suitability of rice cultivation in the study area, with the integration of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land cover, slope, temperature, precipitation and soil parameters (cation exchange capacity, pH, bulk density, organic carbon). We apply the various statistical parameters that include mean spatial NDVI; correlation coefficient, standard deviation and Root Mean Square (RMS) between CRU and NIMET data. Spatial regression trend analysis is conducted between CRU precipitation and NDVI and between CRU temperature and NDVI from 1985 to 2015. The results reveal that NDVI in highly suitable rice planting regions is higher than marginally suitable regions except in the months of October and November, which shows that the highly suitable regions will yield better than the marginally suitable regions during the dry season. Additionally, NDVI is seasonally bimodal in response to precipitation, meaning that vegetation vigor is more dependent on precipitation than temperature. Finally, the correlation coefficient, standard deviation and RMS between CRU and NIMET precipitation data shows 0.42, 108, and 110, respectively, while these three factors between CRU and NIMET temperature data shows 0.88, 1.60, and 0.86, respectively. In conclusion, the MCDM approach reveals that upland is more suitable for rice cultivation in Benue State when comparing with the area provided by the Global Land Cover and National Mappings Organization (GLCNMO) data.

TI  - GIS-Based Landscape Stability Analysis: A Comparison of Overlay Method and Fuzzy Model for the Case Study in Slovakia
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape stability refers to spatial and functional stability of land use categories over time. This article is focused on the identification and comparison of stable areas in landscape using the overlay method and fuzzy model applying geographic information systems. The study area includes Handlova town and Cigel municipality in Slovakia. Both methods were based on land use data from 1955, 1987, 2003, and 2016. After determining stable areas, it was found that the difference between the overlay method and fuzzy model was 29.62 percent. Both methods resulted in an almost identical size of stable built-up area. The stable forest area computed by the fuzzy model was larger than the one calculated by the overlay method. Using the fuzzy model, arable land and grassland categories were mainly found to be unstable. As for the overlay method, the share of stable areas in case of arable land and grassland categories was 5.89 percent of the total stable area.

TI  - Harnessing the power of immersive virtual reality - visualization and analysis of 3D earth science data sets
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability and quantity of remotely sensed and terrestrial geospatial data sets are on the rise. Historically, these data sets have been analyzed and quarried on 2D desktop computers; however, immersive technologies and specifically immersive virtual reality (iVR) allow for the integration, visualization, analysis, and exploration of these 3D geospatial data sets. iVR can deliver remote and large-scale geospatial data sets to the laboratory, providing embodied experiences of field sites across the earth and beyond. We describe a workflow for the ingestion of geospatial data sets and the development of an iVR workbench, and present the application of these for an experience of Iceland's Thrihnukar volcano where we: (1) combined satellite imagery with terrain elevation data to create a basic reconstruction of the physical site; (2) used terrestrial LiDAR data to provide a geo-referenced point cloud model of the magmatic-volcanic system, as well as the LiDAR intensity values for the identification of rock types; and (3) used Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to construct a photorealistic point cloud of the inside volcano. The workbench provides tools for the direct manipulation of the georeferenced data sets, including scaling, rotation, and translation, and a suite of geometric measurement tools, including length, area, and volume. Future developments will be inspired by an ongoing user study that formally evaluates the workbench's mature components in the context of fieldwork and analyses activities.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging for the prevention and management of breast cancer-related lymphedema: A systematic review
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node identification by near infrared (NIR) fluorescence with indocyanine green (ICG) is recognized in the literature as a useful technique. NIR fluorescence technology could become key in the prevention and management of lymphedema after axillary dissection for breast cancer. Here, we conducted a systematic review focusing on ICG imaging to improve lymphedema prevention and treatment after axillary surgery.A systematic literature review was performed using MEDLINE and Embase to identify articles focused on ICG imaging for breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Qualitative analysis was performed to summarize the characteristics of reported ICG procedures. In situ tissue identification and functionality assessment based on fluorescence signal were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were appraised when reported.Studies relating to axillary reverse mapping, lymphography and upper limb supermicrosurgery combined with ICG imaging were identified. We included a total of 33 relevant articles with a total of 2016 patients enrolled. ICG imaging for axillary reverse mapping was safe for all 951 included patients, with identification of arm nodes in 80%-88% of patients with axillary lymph nodes dissection. However, the papers discuss the oncologic safety of the approach and how - regardless of the contrast agent - concerns limit its adoption. ICG lymphography is openly supported in BCRL management, with 1065 patients undergoing this procedure in 26 articles. The technique is reported for lymphedema diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity, staging, intraoperative mapping and patency control in lymphaticovenular anastomosis. The substantial advantages/disadvantages of ICG imaging procedures are finally described.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of land use driving force in coal mining area: case study in Ningdong, China
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial techniques such as remote sensing and Geographic Information System are very important for studying the dynamic process of land use. To analyze the land use change and assess the driving force, SPOT satellite images of 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 were used. Classification of land use was applied using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Maximum Likelihood Technique in ENVI 5.3. Transition images and matrix were applied using Arcgis10.5 with the Excel PivotTable function. To determine the driving forces of land use change in the study area, Quantitative and Qualitative analysis were applied. Data were compared with statistical analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results showed that, the images of the study area were categorized into vegetation (arable land, garden, woodland, grassland, water and agriculture), construction (industrial and transportation) and unutilized land (salt marsh, sandy land, bare land and gully erosion land). From 2005 to 2018, constriction land use greatly increased from 100.41 km(2) (2.88%) and 305.13 km(2) (8.76%), respectively. Vegetation was decreased from 3190 km(2) (91.55%) 3028 km(2) (86.91%) in 2005 and 2018, respectively. Results of the comprehensive index of land use degree, dynamic degree, quantitative and qualitative analysis show major changes in land use of the area that caused by human activities especially new developments during the period of the study. The results showed that the Ningdong base in 2005-2018 has been in the stage of sustainable development, mainly in the conversion of grassland, forest land and cultivated land to construction land. High values of rate of change in land use related to the development and new construction and building area. This development might be as a result of anthropogenic activities through urban growth coupled with its potential impacts on urban climate. The principal component analysis shows that human activities drive the change of land use pattern in Ningdong, mainly including the policy of closing the grazing ban, industrialization and scale, population growth and urbanization. Results can provide effective data for the future ecological environment protection and sustainable development of Ningdong Energy Base. Remote sensing is a good technique for assessing the actual sequence in the development of any area that may be caused by human activities.

TI  - Impact of Wildfire Smoke on Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Colorado, 2007-2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Colorado is regularly impacted by long-range transport of wildfire smoke from upwind regions. This smoke is a major source of ambient PM2.5. Maternal exposure to total PM2.5 during pregnancy has been linked to decreased birth weight and other adverse outcomes, although the impact of wildfire smoke contribution has only recently been investigated. The objective of this study was to estimate associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes and ambient wildfire smoke PM2.5. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposures were estimated using a previously published method incorporating ground-based monitors and remote sensing data. Logistic regression models stratified by ZIP code and mixed models with random intercept by ZIP code were used to test for associations. The primary outcomes of interest were preterm birth and birth weight. Secondary outcomes included gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, neonatal intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, small for gestational age, and low birth weight. Exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 over the full gestation and during the second trimester were positively associated with pre-term birth (OR = 1.076 (mu g/m(3))(-1) [95% CI = 1.016, 1.139; p = 0.013] and 1.132 (mu g/m(3))(-1) [95% CI = 1.088, 1.178]; p < 0.0001, respectively), while exposure during the first trimester was associated with decreased birth weight (-5.7 g/(mu g/m(3)) [95% CI: -11.1, -0.4; p = 0.036]). Secondary outcomes were mixed.

TI  - Timing of red-edge and shortwave infrared reflectance critical for early stress detection induced by bark beetle (<i>Ips typographus</i>, L.) attack
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance in Europe, induced by European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus, L., results in regionalscale dieback. Early stress detection in Norway spruce stands caused by bark beetle infestation at the green attack stage (when trees are yet to show distinct symptoms observable by the human eye) is crucial and can lead to improved forest management and reduced economic losses. This study aims to investigate and understand the dynamics of leaf traits and reflectance of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees during bark beetle attack. Using high-resolution temporal images from RapidEye and SPOT-5 in parallel with the collection of field data, we examined which spectral regions and leaf traits are affected by infestation over time and how they help the discrimination between healthy and infested plots at the early stage of the attack. To achieve this aim, we used a novel approach by targeting both leaf and canopy level. We measured leaf reflectance spectra and six leaf traits (water content, nitrogen, chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll and stomatal conductance) from 66 (30 plots) healthy and 54 (8 plots) infested trees at three consecutive time measurements in the summer of 2015 in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Concurrently, canopy reflectance and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were extracted from the selected plots (30 healthy plots) using seven RapidEye images and six SPOT-5 images. For the infested plots, in addition to the field measured plots (8), canopy spectral reflectance were extracted from the reference infestation data (291 plots) obtained through visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs. Results demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05) in the studied leaf traits between healthy and infested samples, and these differences increased with the progression of infestation. We found that leaf and canopy reflectance were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) for the infested trees by bark beetle than the healthy ones in the 'red edge' (680-790 nm) and 'shortwave infrared' (1110-1490 nm) spectrum throughout the infestation event. Our results further demonstrated that the spectral vegetation indices calculated from the red-edge and SWIR spectral bands, such as NDRE, DSWI, LWCI and NDWI, were able to differentiate between healthy and infested trees earlier than the other SVIs. The new insight offered by these results is that the red-edge and SWIR spectral information from multispectral satellites has the potential to considerably improve monitoring and detection of forest stress and has important implications for European field bark beetle management and future studies.

TI  - Performance of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Surveillance in Yemen: Interview Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major challenge to ending TB occurrence by 2035. In Yemen, the 2011 survey showed an MDR-TB prevalence of 1.4% among new cases and 14.4% among previously treated cases. The National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTCP) established four MDR-TB sentinel surveillance sites in 2013 to monitor the MDR-TB situation. In Yemen, the 2011 survey showed an MDR-TB prevalence of 1.4% among new cases and 14.4% among previously treated cases. The NTCP established four MDR-TB sentinel surveillance sites in 2013 to monitor the MDR-TB situation.Objective: This study aimed to assess the performance of MDR-TB surveillance and determine its strengths and weaknesses.Methods: We used the updated Center for Diseases Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Interviews were conducted with NTCP managers and Regional MDR-TB centers' staff using a semistructured questionnaire. We used a 5-point Likert scale to assess the usefulness and other attributes (eg, simplicity and flexibility). The mean percentage was calculated for each attribute and used for the final rank of the performance: poor (<60%), average (60%-80%), and good (>80%).Results: The MDR-TB surveillance system achieved good performance in usefulness (87%), acceptability (82%), and data quality (91%); average performance in flexibility (61%) and simplicity (72%); and poor performance in stability (55%). The overall performance score was average (74%). Although strong commitment, good monitoring, and well-trained staff are the main strengths, depending on an external fund is a major weakness along with unavailability of the MDR-TB unit at the governorate level.Conclusions: Although the MDR-TB surveillance system has achieved an average overall performance, more efforts are required to improve its stability by ensuring constant power supply to enable laboratories to perform necessary diagnostic and follow-up tests. Gradual replacement of donors' funds by the government is recommended. Scaling up of MDR-TB services and removing access barriers are crucial.

TI  - Preliminary site selection for an observatory in the Egyptian Eastern Desert
T2  - ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims for choosing preliminary sites that can be candidates for a new astronomical observatory that will replace the Kottamia observatory. The candidate sites have been selected to be investigated after proposing a few criteria. Concerning light pollution and elevation of the sites as the main factors, we chose the candidate sites depending on the zenith sky brightness and the elevation. The night sky brightness has been measured using a Sky Quality Meter at different altitude degrees and the values of the zenith sky brightness were compared to those of different observatory sites. Our night sky brightness observations were found to be in agreement with the satellite's data and comparable to those of dark sites, with average values of 22.07, 22.03, 21.57 and 21.58 mag(SQM)/arcsec(2). We also have obtained the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and extinction coefficient due to the aerosol for the candidate sites using satellite data (Terra/MODIS).

TI  - Potential of Virtual Earth Observation Constellations in Archaeological Research
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation sensors continually provide datasets with different spectral and spatial characteristics, while a series of pre- and postprocessing techniques are needed for calibration purposes. Nowadays, a variety of satellite images have become accessible to researchers, while big data cloud platforms allow them to deal with an extensive number of datasets. However, there is still difficulty related to these sensors meeting specific needs and challenges such as those of cultural heritage and supporting archaeological research world-wide. The harmonization and synergistic use of different sensors can be used in order to maximize the impact of earth observation sensors and enhance their benefit to the scientific community. In this direction, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has proposed the concept of virtual constellations, which is defined as "a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the Earth system". This paper provides an overview of existing and future earth observation sensors, the various levels of interoperability as proposed by Wulder et al., and presents some preliminary results from the Thessalian plain in Greece using integrated optical and radar Sentinel images. The potential for archaeolandscape studies using virtual constellations is discussed here.

TI  - Journey through the birth, growth and maturity of X-ray astronomy
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this biographical account, I recall my scientific journey that began in 1961 when I joined as a Physics Trainee in the BARC Training School and after one year course was admitted in TIFR as a Research Associate. During 1962-1967, I worked on determination of the He3/He4 ratio in cosmic rays using a gas Cerenkov counter and also used a scintillation + solid Cerenkov detector to measure flux of protons and helium nuclei in primary cosmic rays. I also developed a large area scintillation-Cerenkov detector with a spark chamber between them for measuring charge composition of primary cosmic rays. I joined the X-ray astronomy programme in 1967 initiated by Prof. B. V. Sreekantan and played a leading role in developing a balloon borne hard X-ray instrument for studying time variability and energy spectra of cosmic X-ray sources. We carried out a series of balloon experiments and studied temporal intensity variation and energy spectra of X-ray objects like Sco X-1, Cyg X-1, etc. Results on rapid intensity changes and spectra appeared in a series of publications based on which I obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1972. Immediately afterwards, I joined Prof. Gordon Garmire at Caltech as a Research Fellow (a post-doctoral position) to work with him on the low energy component of HEAO A-2 experiment. The instrument was developed and successfully realised. Working on this satellite experiment was a thrilling experience which exposed me to the technical complexities of space instruments. The HEAO-1 satellite was launched in 1978. During 1978-1979, Guenter Riegler and I, working at JPL, reported detection of intense soft X-rays from several classes of extragalactic and Galactic objects like new BL Lacs, a new AM Her binary, coronal X-rays from active stars, etc. After returning to TIFR, I developed a rocket experiment with K. P. Singh to map the spatial and spectral distribution of the Soft Diffuse X-ray Background. At the same time, I also designed 15 cm deep Xenon filled Proportional Counters (XPCs) of similar to 2500 cm2 area for balloon experiments which were done during 1983-1990 and produced new results on several X-ray binaries. During this period I also developed a proportional counter (PC) based satellite instrument and submitted a proposal jointly with the astronomy group at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for an Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE). After success of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), the IXAE instrument was included on the top deck of the IRS-P3 satellite that was launched in March 1996. Despite the severe limitation of a polar orbit, the IXAE observed a good number of X-ray binaries and produced interesting results, with the most notable being quasi-regular bursts from a new transient, GRS 1915+105, which turned out to be an enigmatic black hole source. Following success of the IXAE, a proposal for an ambitious multiwavelength astronomy satellite, named ASTROSAT, with broad spectral coverage in the optical, NUV, FUV, soft X-ray and hard X-ray by a suite of instruments, was submitted to ISRO and finally approved by the Govt. of India in 2004. Over the next 10 years, the development and fabrication of the five ASTROSAT instruments were accomplished and a PSLV launch on Sept. 28, 2015 placed ASTROSAT in a 650 km circular orbit with 6 degree inclination. The ASTROSAT instruments have been performing well for similar to 4 years and have observed more than 500 cosmic sources. Results from ASTROSAT have appeared in a large number of journal publications.Successful realization and performance of ASTROSAT marks culmination of my research career. I formally retired as a Senior Professor from TIFR on 2006 April 30 on attaining the age of superannuation. However by agreement with TIFR, ISRO designated me `ISRO Chair Professor', which was later renamed as ISRO Satish Dhawan Professor, and asked me to continue to lead ASTROSAT as PI. At the end of my tenure as ISRO Professor on 2011 April 30, I relinquished the PI position. I am at present affiliated with the MU-DAE Centre of Excellence for Basic Sciences, Mumbai University Campus at Mumbai as an Emeritus Professor.

AB  - Vegetation health of any ecosystem and changes in it are vital in global change in ecology and it is delicately linked to climate change. This study evaluated the spatial patterns of significant negative change trend using composite NOAA-AVHRR data time series (1982-2006), long term forest fire point data, invasive hotspot data and predicted climate anomalies data over the different harmonized landcover categories of India. Around 65% of Indian forest shows the trend of negative change. Significant negative change were found to be highest (203,026 km(2)) over 'Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests' category, followed by 'Tropical lowland forests, broadleaved, evergreen' (81,555 km(2)) and 'Evergreen shrubland & regrowth/Abandoned shifting cultivation/Extensive shifting cultivation' (55,811 km(2)). Around 85% of Indian biodiversity hotspot showed the negative change. The analysis of forest fire revealed the 'Tropical mixed deciduous and dry deciduous forests' retained the highest forest fire percentage (40%). The prediction of temperature anomalies for the year 2030 using RCP 4.5 model showed the increase in the temperature in the range of 0.58-1.32 degrees C and was found highest in northern part of India. Similarly, the rainfall prediction for the year 2030 showed rainfall deficit in several states of India. The outcomes of the present study would help in prioritization of various vegetation types suffering from anthropogenic and natural disturbances and will guide the policymakers to safeguard, prioritized forest areas for effective conservation, scientific protection and climate change mitigation endeavors.

TI  - Biomass Assessment of Agricultural Crops Using Multi-temporal Dual-Polarimetric TerraSAR-X Data
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The biomass of three agricultural crops, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and canola (Brassica napus L.), was studied using multi-temporal dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X data. The radar backscattering coefficient sigma nought of the two polarization channels HH and VV was extracted from the satellite images. Subsequently, combinations of HH and VV polarizations were calculated (e.g. HH/VV, HH + VV, HH x VV) to establish relationships between SAR data and the fresh and dry biomass of each crop type using multiple stepwise regression. Additionally, the semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) was used to account for the effect of crop biomass on radar backscatter data. The potential of the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach was also explored. The split sampling approach (i.e. 70% training and 30% testing) was carried out to validate the stepwise models, WCM and RF. The multiple stepwise regression method using dual-polarimetric data was capable to retrieve the biomass of the three crops, particularly for dry biomass, with R-2 > 0.7, without any external input variable, such as information on the (actual) soil moisture. A comparison of the random forest technique with the WCM reveals that the RF technique remarkably outperformed the WCM in biomass estimation, especially for the fresh biomass. For example, the R-2 > 0.68 for the fresh biomass estimation of different crop types using RF whereas WCM show R-2 < 0.35 only. However, for the dry biomass, the results of both approaches resembled each other.

TI  - Earthquake-Induced Landslide Mapping for the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake Using PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information about landslides during or immediately after an event is an invaluable source for emergency response and management. Using an active sensor, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can capture images of the earth's surface regardless of weather conditions and may provide a solution to the problem of mapping landslides when clouds obstruct optical imaging. The 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake (M-w 6.6) and its aftershocks not only caused major damage with severe loss of life and property but also induced many landslides across the area. To gain a better understanding of the landslides induced by this earthquake, we proposed a method of landslide mapping using pre- and post-event Advanced Land Observation Satellite 2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) images acquired from both descending and ascending orbits. Moreover, the accuracy of the classification results was verified by comparisons with high-resolution optical images, and ground truth data (provided by GSI, Japan). The detected landslides show a good match with the reference optical images by visual comparison. The quantitative comparison results showed that a combination of the descending and ascending intensity-based landslide classification had the best accuracy with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 80.1% and 0.45, respectively.

TI  - STATISTICAL DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGIES OF IRRIGATED AREAS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS: A REVIEW
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Review
AB  - Inconsistencies in the statistical data sets of irrigated areas at the national level could have considerable implications for policies developed for food and water security. Remote sensing can address this issue; however, doubts about its reliability inhibit its protagonist role. Methods that integrate both remote sensing based and statistical data sets seem expedient, and they are more likely to be acknowledged by policymakers. Therefore, it is important for scientists to know the basis and limitations of statistical data sets which originate at the country level. Data collection methodologies of irrigated areas have been reviewed for seven Asian countries, namely China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia and Thailand. Factors causing the uncertainties in data, and the limitations of data collection methodologies, were highlighted. Also, an irrigation density distribution analysis was conducted to understand the relation of spatial spread pattern of irrigated areas and uncertainty in their statistical records. It was found that irrigated area statistics are mostly based on information originating from water user associations and farmers, which is either self-reported or collected through interviews during surveys and censuses. The main causes of discrepancy were lack of resources to frequently enumerate the irrigated land, inconsistency in data collection methodologies, unaccounted secondary crops, illegal and unregulated water use, and bureaucratic and political constraints. Irrigation density distribution analysis showed that largely scattered irrigated areas might be prone to a lack of comprehensive and frequent enumeration. Furthermore, dense irrigation regions might have potentially unrecorded irrigated areas where temporary or supplementary irrigation arrangements are made by marginal farmers.

TI  - Short-term electricity demand forecasting using machine learning methods enriched with ground-based climate and ECMWF Reanalysis atmospheric predictors in southeast Queensland, Australia
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable models that can forecast energy demand (G) are needed to implement affordable and sustainable energy systems that promote energy security. In particular, accurate G models are required to monitor and forecast local electricity demand. However, G forecasting is a multivariate problem, and thus models must employ robust pattern recognition algorithms that can detect subtle variations in G due to causal factors, such as climate variables. Therefore, this study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model that used climatic variables for 6-hour (h) and daily G forecasting. The input variables included the six most relevant climate variables from Scientific Information for Land Owners (SILO) and 51 Reanalysis variables obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) models. This information was used to forecast G data obtained from the energy utility (Energex) at 8 stations in southeast Queensland, Australia, by utilizing statistically significant lagged cross-correlations of G with its predictor variables. The developed ANN model was then benchmarked against multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), multiple linear regression (MLR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models using various statistical metrics, such as relative root-mean square error (RRMSE%). Additionally, this study developed a hybrid ANN model by combining the forecasts of the ANN, MARS, and MLR models. The bootstrap (B) technique was also used with the hybrid ANN model, creating the B-hybrid ANN, to estimate the forecast uncertainty. According to both forecast horizons, the results indicated that the ANN model was more accurate than the ARIMA, MARS, and MLR models for G forecasting. Furthermore, the hybrid ANN was the most accurate model developed in this research study. For example, at the best site (Redcliffe), the hybrid ANN model generated an RRMSE of 3.85% and 4.37% for the 6-h and daily horizons, respectively. This study found that an ANN model could be used for accurately forecasting G over multiple horizons in southeast Queensland.

TI  - Assessing Multiple Years' Spatial Variability of Crop Yields Using Satellite Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing crop yield trends over years is a key step in site specific management, in view of improving the economic and environmental profile of agriculture. This study was conducted in a 11.07 ha area under Mediterranean climate in Northern Italy to evaluate the spatial variability and the relationships between six remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and grain yield (GY) in five consecutive years. A total of 25 satellite (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) images were downloaded during crop growth to obtain the following VIs: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Simple Ratio (SR). The surveyed crops were durum wheat in 2010, sunflower in 2011, bread wheat in 2012 and 2014, and coriander in 2013. Geo-referenced GY and VI data were used to generate spatial trend maps across the experimental field through geostatistical analysis. Crop stages featuring the best correlations between VIs and GY at the same spatial resolution (30 m) were acknowledged as the best periods for GY prediction. Based on this, 2-4 VIs were selected each year, totalling 15 VIs in the five years with r values with GY between 0.729** and 0.935**. SR and NDVI were most frequently chosen (six and four times, respectively) across stages from mid vegetative to mid reproductive growth. Conversely, SAVI never had correlations high enough to be selected. Correspondence analysis between remote VIs and GY based on quantile ranking in the 126 (30 m size) pixels exhibited a final agreement between 64% and 86%. Therefore, Landsat imagery with its spatial and temporal resolution proved a good potential for estimating final GY over different crops in a rotation, at a relatively small field scale.

TI  - A tumor board report of an 83-year-old woman with stage IB grade 3 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - An 83-year-old woman presented with postmenopausal bleeding ultimately leading to surgery and a final diagnosis of stage IB grade 3 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The tumor board reviewed current literature regarding the efficacy of sentinel lymph node dissection in appropriately allocating stage in high-grade endometrial cancer. The optimal role of adjuvant treatment in this setting is unclear. Current literature surrounding adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy, as well as current practices in molecular diagnostics for endometrial cancer were reviewed. The tumor board concluded that literature surrounding sentinel lymph node evaluation in high-grade endometrial cancers is robust enough to incorporate into clinical practice. Based on the best available evidence, a decision was made to treat with external beam radiotherapy and withhold chemotherapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
M3  - Article
AB  - Processes occurring on the plasma-facing walls in the large Helical Device (LHD) and in-vessel material migration were investigated using a technique of material deposition probes. Ten Si plates were located on the outer side of the first-wall surface in each 36 degrees toroidal section (Nos. 1-10). Mixed-material layers deposited on the probes during the fiscal year 2012 plasma campaign contained carbon, boron, hydrogen, and metals from which the plasma-facing elements were made. Metallic impurities and hydrogen content in deposited layers were examined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA), respectively. The cross-sectional observations of the deposited mixed-material layers were performed with the help of a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. The results of the combined RBS/ERDA analysis and TEM-EDX examination allow tracing the processes occurring on plasma-facing components during the plasma campaign.

TI  - Troughs developed in ice-stream shear margins precondition ice shelves for ocean-driven breakup
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Floating ice shelves of fast-flowing ice streams are prone to rift initiation and calving originating along zones of rapid shearing at their margins. Predicting future ice-shelf destabilization under a warming ocean scenario, with the resultant reduced buttressing, faster ice flow, and sea-level rise, therefore requires an understanding of the processes that thin and weaken these shear margins. Here, we use satellite data to show that high velocity gradients result in surface troughs along the margins of fast-flowing ice streams. These troughs are advected into ice-shelf margins, where the locally thinned ice floats upward to form basal troughs. Buoyant plumes of warm ocean water beneath ice shelves can be focused into these basal troughs, localizing melting and weakening the ice-shelf margins. This implies that major ice sheet drainages are preconditioned for rapid retreat in response to ocean warming.

TI  - SentimagIC: A Non-inferiority Trial Comparing Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Versus Technetium-99m and Blue Dye in the Detection of Axillary Sentinel Nodes in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a highly accurate method for staging the axilla in early breast cancer. Superparamagnetic iron oxide mapping agents have been explored to overcome the disadvantages of the standard SLNB technique, which uses a radioisotope tracer with or without blue dye. One such agent, Sienna+, was shown to be non-inferior to the standard technique for SLNB in a number of studies. The SentimagIC trial was designed to establish the non-inferiority of a new formulation of this magnetic tracer, Magtrace (formerly SiennaXP). Methods Patients with clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer were recruited from six centers in the US. Patients received radioisotope and isosulfan blue dye injections, followed by an intraoperative injection of magnetic tracer, prior to SLNB. The sentinel node identification rate was compared between the magnetic and standard techniques to evaluate non-inferiority and concordance. Results Data were collected for 146 procedures in 146 patients. The per patient detection rate was 99.3% (145/146) when using the magnetic tracer and 98.6% (144/146) when using the standard technique, while the nodal detection rate was 94.3% (348/369 nodes) when using the magnetic tracer and 93.5% (345/369) when using the standard technique (difference 0.8%, 95% binomial confidence interval lower bound - 2.1%). Of the 22 patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), 21 (95.4%) were detected by both the magnetic tracer and the standard technique. All malignant nodes detected by standard technique were also identified by the magnetic technique. Conclusion The magnetic technique is non-inferior to the standard technique of radioisotope and blue dye for axillary SLN detection in early-stage breast cancer. The magnetic technique is therefore a viable alternative.

TI  - Use of Very High-Resolution Optical Data for Landslide Mapping and Susceptibility Analysis along the Karnali Highway, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karnali highway is a vital transport link and the only primary roadway that connects the remote Karnali region to the lowlands in Mid-Western Nepal. Every year there are reports of landslides blocking the road, making this area largely inaccessible. However, little effort has focused on systematically identifying landslides and landslide-prone areas along this highway. In this study, landslides were mapped with an object-based approach from very high-resolution optical satellite imagery obtained by the DigitalGlobe constellation in 2012 and PlanetScope in 2018. Landslides ranging from 10 to 30,496 m(2) were detected within a 3 km buffer along the highway. Most of the landslides were located at lower elevations (between 500-1500 m) and on steep south-facing slopes. Landslides tended to cluster closer to the highway, near drainage channels and away from faults. Landslides were also most prevalent within the Kuncha Formation geologic class, and the forested and agricultural land cover classes. A susceptibility map was then created using a logistic regression methodology to highlight patterns in landslide activity. The landslide susceptibility map showed a good prediction rate with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90. A total of 33% of the study arealies in high/very high susceptibility zones. The map highlighted the lower elevated areas between Bangesimal and Manma towns with the Kuncha Formation geologic class as being the most hazardous. The banks of the Karnali River, its tributaries and areas near the highway were also highly susceptible to landslides. The results highlight the potential of very high-resolution optical imagery for documenting detailed spatial information on landslide occurrence, which enables susceptibility assessment in remote and data scarce regions such as the Karnali highway.

TI  - Evaluation of Two Malaria Surveillance Systems in Yemen Using Updated CDC Guidelines: Lessons Learned and Future Perspectives
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yemen is classified as high malaria endemic area with two-thirds of population at risk. Currently, the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) uses two malaria surveillance systems: the Integrated Malaria Surveillance System (IMSS) and the Early Disease Electronic Warning System (eDEWS). This study aimed to assess and compare the usefulness and attributes of the two malaria surveillance systems. The systems were evaluated according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated guidelines. Data were collected from 10 stakeholders through interviews and from 10 districts' coordinators and 20 health facilities' focal points using semistructured questionnaire. The score of the system attributes were interpreted as very poor, poor, average, good, and excellent according to the mean percent score. Both systems were found to be useful. The IMSS overall performance score was poor where flexibility was average and simplicity, acceptability, representativeness, and stability were poor. For eDEWS, the overall performance score was good where data quality, acceptability, and flexibility were excellent; simplicity was good; representativeness was average; and stability was poor. In conclusion, although the IMSS was found to be useful for assessing the burden of malaria, response to outbreak, and future planning, the overall performance was poor. While the eDEWS overall level of performance was good, it was found to be useful only for outbreak detection. Therefore, both surveillance systems need to be integrated for the advantages of both systems to be maintained.

TI  - Estimating the Prevalence of Human Trafficking in Ohio, 2014-2016
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To develop statewide estimates of known victims and individuals at risk of human trafficking in Ohio.Methods. We collected information from 12 state and local sources including child welfare, legal services, and law enforcement data. We collected the data from agency records dating 2013 to 2018. However, the majority of data were from calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016 (roughly 95% across individual and aggregate sources). We used probabilistic matching to estimate victim and at-risk cases-accounting for duplicates.Results. According to available data, there were 1032 known victims during the study time frame. We identified approximately 4209 at-risk individuals based on youths presenting with common risk factors for trafficking victimization.Conclusions. Estimating the prevalence of human trafficking is an important public health research priority. As the first "cataloging" of existing record systems in Ohio to our knowledge, this study provided a comprehensive overview of the number of victims and the type of information that is available in the state. This study highlights the importance of moving toward the use of epidemiological approaches to measure the prevalence of human trafficking.

TI  - COBIS: Opportunistic <i>C</i>-Band Bistatic SAR Differential Interferometry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring large built structures, landslides, volcanoes, or glaciers implies relative height measurements and line-of-sight (LOS) displacement measurements, which are typically performed with monostatic spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. In this case, for each satellite that illuminates a given location, we can usually exploit only the information available from one ascending/descending orbit, and if the satellite uses multiple subswaths, the information is obtained only from one subswath per orbit. A bistatic configuration with spaceborne transmitter and fixed ground-based (GB) receiver opens the possibility to exploit the information available from more than one orbit and one subswath per orbit. Additionally, such a configuration offers new perspectives for target tracking and characterization (e.g., multiple LOSs and bistatic scattering signatures). This article presents an opportunistic C-band bistatic SAR differential interferometry architecture that uses a multichannel GB stationary receiver and a separate transmitter, which can be either the Sentinel-1A/B satellite, used opportunistically, or a specially designed GB sliding transmitter. The combination of the operation modes based on spaceborne and GB transmitter allows monitoring a small critical area of interest with many acquisitions triggered by the GB transmitter and surveying of the whole surrounding area with a small number of acquisitions corresponding to the satellites passes. The hardware platforms are presented along with the bistatic interferometric processing flow, and the potential of the proposed architecture is assessed in the context of monitoring large built structures.

TI  - THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOUTH FAMILY VALUES WITH HEDONISM AND EUDEMONIA
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. A notable trend in modern society is the transformation of family institution, which has long been considered the most important social and personal value. The change of attitudes of young people towards marriage in Russia is slower than in Europe; however, this process is becoming more obvious today and there is an urgent need to study it. So far, very little research has been carried out. In psychology and other social sciences, it is widely believed that the family formation is hampered by a hedonistic worldview. However, it is well known that the family provides the opportunities to meet many important human needs. This contradiction has prompted the direction of the present research.The aim of this research is to empirically investigate whether there is the conflict of the perceptions of the Russian young people about family values and hedonic and eudemonic orientations.Methodology and research methods. The empirical research was conducted using K. Peterson's questionnaire "Happiness Orientations". 173 students (49% female) took part in the research project. To assess the importance of family and different family values, the authors of the present research elaborated a special questionnaire, the reliability of which was confirmed in the course of approbation. The information obtained was processed through the means of correlation, regression analysis and nonparametric statistics in Statistica 10; confirmatory factor analysis of questionnaires was performed in Mplus 7.Results. The results of path analysis of interrelations between hedonism, eudemonia and family values indicated that family values were correlated not only with the orientation to meaningful and dignified life (eudemonia), but also with the orientation to pleasure (hedonism). The orientation hedonism was higher in young women; therefore, multiple regression analysis of the relationship between the studied phenomena was conducted in separate male and female groups of respondents. The results demonstrated that the value of birth and child-rearing in women is correlated with hedonism; the general value of family in male respondents is related with eudemonia.Scientific novelty. This investigation confirms that there is no contradiction between hedonism and family values. The research findings deduce that both eudemonic and hedonic orientations support family values, although the system of relationships between these orientations may vary according to gender. This finding expands our knowledge about hedonism and its role in modern society.Practical significance. The research results expand the understanding of hedonism and its role in modern society, clarifying the content of activities to prepare young people for family life. In order to enhance the effectiveness of such psychological and pedagogical support, one should take into account the hedonic tendencies of young people, revealing the importance of family formation in the context of personal happiness.

TI  - Feature clustering based discrimination of ship targets for SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most important and widely-used tools of large scale marine surveillance. Constant false alarm rate is tailored for maritime metallic target detection in SAR images. However, it is very difficult to distinguish ship targets from other metallic targets. Some manual features have been designed to discriminate ship and non-ship target. These manual features often overfit some scenarios but fail to other situations. Recently, deep convolutional networks have achieved impressive success in optical image classification, which encourages scholars of remote sensing society to leverage this powerful tool to extract robust features of SAR ship targets. This study adopts VGG-16 to extract features of ship and non-ship targets. Then, unsupervised clustering is conducted to group ship and non-ship targets, respectively, using the extracted features, which can effectively tackle intraspecies variants of ship and non-ship targets. Finally, these representative feature vectors are utilised to differentiate ship and non-ship targets of other scenarios. The proposed algorithms are extensively tested undertaken on 11 ALOS-2 SAR images, which demonstrate good performance of the methods.

TI  - Multi-sensor prediction of <i>Eucalyptus</i> stand volume: A support vector approach
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stem volume is a key attribute of Eucalyptus forest plantations upon which decision-making is based at diverse levels of planning. Quantifying volume through remote sensing can support a proper management of forests. Because of limitations on spaceborne optical and synthetic aperture radar sensors, this study integrated both types of datasets assembled using support vector regression (SVR) to retrieve the stand volume of Eucalyptus plantations. We assessed different combinations of sensors and a minimum number of plots to develop an SVR model. Finally, the best SVR performance was compared with other analytical methods already tested and in the literature: multilinear regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest (RF). Here, we introduce a test for comparative analysis of the performance of different methods. We found that SVR accurately predicted stem volume of Brazilian fast-growing Eucalyptus forest plantations. Gaussian radial basis was the most suitable kernel function. Integrating the optical and L-band backscatter data increased the predictive accuracy compared to a single sensor model. Combining NIR-band data from ALOS AVNIR-2 and backscatter of L-band horizontal emitted and vertical received (HV) electric fields from ALOS PALSAR produced the most accurate SVR model (with an R-2 of 0.926 and root mean square error of 11.007 m(3)/ha). The number of field plots sufficient for model development with non-redundant explanatory variables was 77. Under this condition, SVR performed similarly to ANN and outperformed the multiple linear regression and random forest methods.

TI  - Integration of a Landsat Time-Series of NBR and Hydrological Modeling to Assess <i>Pinus pinaster</i> Aiton. Forest Defoliation in South-Eastern Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of Mediterranean coniferous plantations. Here, we integrate a Landsat time series with a physically-based distributed hydrological model (Watershed Integrated Management in Mediterranean Environments-WiMMed) to examine spatially-explicit relationships between the mortality processes of Pinus pinaster plantations and the hydrological regime, using different spectral indices of vegetation and machine learning algorithms. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Moisture Stress Index (MSI) show the highest correlations with defoliation rates. Random Forest was the most accurate model (R-2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.059), showing a high model performance and prediction. Support vector machines and neural networks also demonstrated a high performance (R-2 > 0.7). The main hydrological variables selected by the model to explain defoliation were potential evapotranspiration, winter precipitation and maximum summer temperature (lower Out-of-bag error). These results show the importance of hydrological variables involved in evaporation processes, and on the change in the spatial distribution of seasonal rainfall upon the defoliation processes of P. pinaster. These results underpin the importance of integrating temporal remote sensing data and hydrological models to analyze the drivers of forest defoliation and mortality processes in the Mediterranean climate.

TI  - Thematic Accuracy Quality Control by Means of a Set of Multinomials
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The error matrix has been adopted as both the "de facto" and the "de jure" standard way to report on the thematic accuracy assessment of any remotely sensed data product. This perspective assumes that the error matrix can be considered as a set of values following a unique multinomial distribution. However, the assumption of the underlying statistical model falls down when true reference data are available for quality control. To overcome this problem, a new method for thematic accuracy quality control is proposed, which uses a multinomial approach for each category and is called QCCS (quality control column set). The main advantage is that it allows us to state a set of quality specifications for each class and to test if they are fulfilled. These requirements can be related to the percentage of correctness in the classification for a particular class but also to the percentage of possible misclassifications or confusions between classes. In order to test whether such specifications are achieved or not, an exact multinomial test is proposed for each category. Furthermore, if a global hypothesis test is desired, the Bonferroni correction is proposed. All these new approaches allow a more flexible way of understanding and testing thematic accuracy quality control compared with the classical methods based on the confusion matrix. For a better understanding, a practical example of an application is included for classification with four categories.

TI  - Multi-scale mapping of oil-sands in Anhembi (Brazil) using imaging spectroscopy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, oil-sand outcrops of the Anhembi deposit located in the Parana Basin, Brazil, were investigated using multi-scale imaging spectroscopy. The study incorporated VNIR-SWIR (400-2500 nm) spectroscopic data from imaging (i.e. sisuCHEMA) and nonimaging (i.e. FieldSpec-4) instruments in the lab, an AisaFENIX hyperspectral system on the ground and from the air, and WorldView-3 multispectral instrument. The aim was to assess the usefulness of emerging remote sensing technologies in characterizing hydrocarbon-bearing targets and understand the spatial variability of oil-sands at different scales using multi-source spectroscopic data. The bitumen content of the sands, estimated to be as high as 12 wt. %, was revealed to be unevenly distributed at all scales. Its distribution was shown to be controlled mainly by the clay proportion and permo-porosity of the strata, with the sand sheet facies corresponding to the highest bitumen contents. The ubiquitous clays, identified to be dominantly montmorillonite, were found to be intimately mixed with bitumen at all studied scales. The mean bitumen content was estimated to decrease from (similar to) 6 to 4.5% while moving from small-, to deposit-scale as a consequence of the pixel aggregation effect and incremental clay contribution. The study showed that bitumen determination on the ground requires an imaging system with a high signal-to-noise ratio and good illumination conditions. Spectral denoising is also a crucial prerequisite for the extraction of coherent spectral information from the data. WV-3 data was proved capable of resolving HC's feature at 1700 nm wavelength by its SWIR band-4 over targets encompassing > 30% of the 7.5 m SWIR pixel; albeit it was not successful in determining the total bitumen content of the sands. This work indicated that HC signatures, particularly the one centered at 2300 nm, is consistent and comparable among scales, and upon employing properly calibrated data, could be used to confidently map the bitumen content of oil-sands at all imaging scales. A multi-scale spectroscopic approach can provide a complete picture of the variations in geologic targets and is able to fill the gap in scale differences across scales that when integrated, would add synergy and help reduce the uncertainties associated with ore grade estimation.

TI  - Automatic canola mapping using time series of sentinel 2 images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different techniques utilized for mapping various crops are mainly based on using training dataset. But, due to difficulties of access to a well-represented training data, development of automatic methods for detection of crops is an important need which has not been considered as it deserves. Therefore, main objective of present study was to propose a new automatic method for canola (Brassica napus L.) mapping based on Sentinel 2 satellite time series data. Time series data of three study sites in Iran (Moghan, Gorgan, Qazvin) and one site in USA: (Oklahoma), were used. Then, spectral reflectance values of canola in various spectral bands were compared with those of the other crops during the growing season. NDVI, Red and Green spectral bands were successfully applied for automatic identification of canola flowering date using the threshold values. Examination of the fisher function indicated that multiplication of the near-infrared (NIR) band by the sum of red and green bands during the flowering date is an efficient index to differentiate canola from the other crops. The Kappa and overall accuracy (OA) for the four study sites were more than 0.75 and 88%, respectively. Results of this research demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach for canola mapping using time series of remotely sensed data.

TI  - Geospatial Technology Application for Groundwater Prospects Mapping of Sub-Upper Krishna Basin, Maharashtra
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to demarcate the groundwater potential areas in sub-upper Krishna basin (SUKB). Geospatial technology applications viz. remote sensing and geographic information system ( GIS) were utilized to generate the groundwater prospects map with the aid of satellite data, secondary data, web mapping services (wms) i.e. Bhuvan geoportal, and Google Earth along with requirement based field visit and ground truth, particularly while preparing a land use/land cover (LULC) map. Using these data sources input parameters which influence the occurrence of groundwater were prepared utilizing ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS IMAGINE image processing software. The input parameters generated were geomorphology, geology, LULC, slope, lineament density, drainage density, and rainfall. Each parameter was treated as a GIS raster theme with a number of features. Each feature of the theme was ranked and weights were assigned to the themes according to their role in influencing the occurrence of groundwater. The ranks and weights were assigned on the basis of opinions of experts in their respective fields and by referring the previous research work on groundwater prospect mapping. All the themes were integrated and Weighted Overlay Model was built in ArcGIS to generate the groundwater prospects map of SUKB. It is found that very good to moderate groundwater potential zones are clustered near the water bodies, cropland, and in floodplain regions of the basin while poor groundwater potential zones are located in the regions of structural origin geological features which seldom support good infiltration of water. The study revealed an exemplary result which is in good agreement with ground reality as validation using field observation data justified the authenticity of the generated groundwater potential (GWP) zones. Hence, geospatial technology application is worthy for mapping the groundwater potential zones which would be further utilized to pinpoint the locations for geophysical investigations for groundwater exploration in the basin.

TI  - Vocational Rehabilitation Outcomes for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and Co-Occurring Psychiatric Disorders
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Competitive, integrated employment for individuals with intellectual disabilities/developmental disabilities (ID/DD) is a national priority. However, individuals with ID and co-occurring psychiatric disorders are given limited attention in the vocational rehabilitation (VR) literature. The current study tested a conceptual model of VR services and client demographic characteristics in relation to competitive employment outcomes using structural equation modeling. A sample was drawn from the Rehabilitation Services Administration 911 dataset (n=3,719; closed cases for Federal Fiscal Year [FY] 2012) for clients with a primary ID and co-occurring secondary psychiatric disorder who received VR services based on their Individualized Plan for Employment. The final model shows job- and personal-related VR services to improve competitive employment outcomes. Differences were found based on race/ethnicity, age, and whether Supplemental Security Income and/or Social Security Disability Insurance benefits were received. Implications for VR counseling and research are discussed.

TI  - Polarimetric Calibration of RISAT-1 Compact-Pol Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - India's radar imaging satellite RISAT-1 was the first spaceborne SAR platform operated in the compact polarimetric (CP) mode, which posed several advantages compared to the commonly used quad-pol system architecture in terms of design complexity and data quality. But, to make use of the advantages offered by the compact polarimetry mode, the acquired datasets should be free from the system induced polarimetric distortions, which include the channel imbalances, phase bias, and crosstalk between the channels. In addition to these system induced errors, the ionosphere also induces polarimetric distortion to the datasets in terms of Faraday rotation. For accurate ground target characterization using the CP datasets, the polarimetric distortions should be estimated and minimized. This article focuses on the CP calibration of the RISAT-1 dataset using trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors deployed at the study area. The CloudeCPdecomposition technique is used to assess the ground target characterization quality of the dataset before and after polarimetric calibration.

TI  - Predictive lithologic mapping of South Korea from geochemical data using decision trees
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Two machine learning algorithms, C4.5 and random forest, collectively known as decision trees were utilized to directly establish the relationship between geochemical maps of South Korea and its geology. Using a large database containing geochemical and lithologic properties, inconsistencies in the a priori lithologic information were fixed using confusion matrix analysis and F-measure comparison via iterative C4.5 implementation. This corrective method resulted in eighteen rock classes but the succeeding C4.5 and random forest application only focused on classifying the 10 most common rock units. Geologic age was included as an attribute at such stage.Results were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, kappa statistics, and F-measure. Average concentration of major oxides using records of correctly classified rock units were evaluated through Z-score normalization. C4.5 classification successfully predicted the spatial distribution of key lithologic units at 87% whereas random forest classification was at 96%. For both decision tree models, average standardized concentration of major oxides in each lithology adhere to perceived geologic knowledge, thereby proving the validity of the results. Rock age is determined as the most important predictor whereas major elements Al2O3, Na2O, and MgO together with trace elements Cr, Ni, and Cu are the strongest numeric predictors.Misinterpreted data points are mainly due to interpolation errors at or near map polygon boundaries, especially where map polygons are less than 50 km(2), and/or natural and anthropogenic contamination. Despite the misclassifications, decision trees are proven to be effective techniques in classifying lithologic units, and thus can reproduce a reliable geologic map from geochemical data of South Korea.

TI  - Inter-calibration of SAR data series for offshore wind resource assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind observations in the marine environment are both costly and sparse. This makes wind retrievals from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) an attractive option in connection with planning of offshore wind farms. Because the wind power density is proportional to the wind speed cubed, it is important to achieve the highest possible absolute accuracy on SAR wind speed retrievals for wind energy applications. A method is presented for inter-calibration of SAR observations from Envisat and Sentinel-1A/B. Sensor-specific effects on the SAR-retrieved wind speeds are first quantified through comparisons against collocated ocean buoy observations. Based on global circulation model simulations of wind speed and direction, we retrieve the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) for different radar incidence angles. Residuals between the retrieved and the observed NRCS are used to inter-calibrate the observed NRCS before reprocessing to SAR wind fields. The inter-calibration leads to an improved agreement between SAR and buoy wind speeds with biases below 0.2 m s(-1) for all investigated SAR sensors. Estimates of the wind resource improve with respect to the buoy observations for ten of the twelve sites investigated. The average deviation between wind power densities is reduced from 20% to 8% as the SAR inter calibration leads to more conservative estimates of the wind resource.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The present research datasets provide a different potential sector of groundwater accessibility in Debre Berhan, Amhara region represented by GIS and remote sensing techniques. Groundwater potential factors such as geology, slope, geomorphology, landuse/landcover, drainage density, and lineament density thematic layers were prepared from the SRTM 30m and LANDSAT multispectral satellite data. Weightage and scores were assigned to all thematic layers based on their groundwater holding capacity. The Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method was applied to integrate all the thematic layers to appraise the groundwater potential sector. From this method, the total data site is classified as very good - 6.5%; good - 22.1%; moderate - 51.2%; low - 18.4%; and very low - 1.8% of the groundwater potential sector. This analysis of data demonstrates the fact that the implication of GIS and remote sensing techniques in groundwater potential sector mapping at the regional scale and suggests that similar techniques could be applied to other regions of this country.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine is planted in mountainous areas with suitable natural conditions. The planting area is complex in terrain,and the planting plots are mostly irregularly shaped. It is difficult to accurately calculate the planting area by traditional survey methods. The method of extracting Chinese herbal medicine planting area combined with remote sensing and GIS technology is of great significance for the rational development and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine resources. Taking Bletilla striata planting in Ningshan county of Shaanxi province as an example,the extraction method of planting area of traditional Chinese medicine in county was studied. High-resolution ZY-3 and GF-1 multi-spectral multi-temporal remote sensing images were used as data sources. Through field sampling,samples such as B. striata,cultivated land,forest land,water body,artificial surface,alpine meadow,etc. are collected. The spectral features,texture features and shape features of remotely identifiable objects in different planting areas and cultivated land,vegetable sheds were analyzed,confusing ground objects were eliminated and interpretation marks were establish. The method of visual interpretation is used to realize the extraction of B. striata planting areas,and the B. striata planting area are calculated by combining GIS technology. The results showed that the method of visual interpretation,using high-resolution ZY-3 and GF-1 multi-spectral multi-temporal remote sensing image data extracted the planting area of 403.05 mu. It can effectively extract the B. striata planting area in research region.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a representative factor that plays a key role in hydrological cycle. It is involved in the interaction between atmosphere and land surface, and is used in fields such as agriculture and water resources. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESACCI) data were used to analyze the applicability and uncertainty of satellite soil moisture product in the Korean peninsula. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and triple collocation (TC) analysis were carried out to investigate uncertainty and correction of satellite soil moisture data. Comparisons of pre-calibration satellite soil moisture data with the Automated Agriculture Observing System (AAOS) indicated that ESACCI and ASCAT data reflect the trend of AAOS well. On the other hand, AMSR2 satellite data showed overestimated values during the freezing period. Correction of satellite soil moisture data using CDF matching improved the error and correlation compared to those before correction. Finally, uncertainty analysis of soil moisture was carried out using TC method. Clearly, the uncertainty of the satellite soil moisture, corrected by CDF matching, was diminished in both freezing and thawing periods. Overall, it is expected that using ASCAT and ESACCI rather than AMSR2 soil moisture data will give more accurate soil moisture information when correction is performed on the Korean peninsula.

TI  - Measuring Sand Dune Migration Rates with COSI-Corr and Landsat: Opportunities and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been over a decade since COSI-Corr, the Co-Registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation, was first used to produce a raster map of sand dune movement, however, no studies have yet applied it to the full Landsat archive. The orthorectified and geolocated Landsat Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) products offer the opportunity to simplify the COSI-Corr pre-processing steps, allowing an automated workflow to be devised. In the Bodele Depression, Chad, this automated workflow has calculated average dune speeds of 15.83 m/year and an increase in dune movement of 2.56 m/year +/- 12.58 m/year from 1987 to 2009. However, this increase does not stem from a systematic increase in dune mobility. The fastest 25% of dunes from 1987 to 1998 reduced their speed by 18.16%. The overall increase stems from the acceleration of features previously moving under 13.30 m/year. While successfully applied to the Bodele Depression, the automated workflow produces highly variable outputs when applied to the Grand Erg Oriental, Algeria. Variations within path/row scene pairings are caused by the use of mobile features, such as dune crests, as ground control points (GCPs). This has the potential to warp Landsat scenes during the L1TP processing, potentially obfuscating dune migration. Two factors appear to be crucial in determining whether a Landsat scene is suitable for COSI-Corr analysis. Firstly, dune mobility must exceed the misregistration criteria. Secondly, GPCs should be located on static features such as bedrock outcrops.

TI  - MYTHOLOGICAL IMAGES OF FATE AS A SOURCE FOR CATEGORIES OF PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the rootedness of the conceptual framework of scientific ontologies (as well as philosophical ones) in the ancient pre-reflexive and pre-theoretical life experience of archaic people, whose mythological contemplation shaped their worldview representations and attitudes. Fate is analyzed as a cultural universal which represents a complex of mythological images - necessity, chance, law, reason, time, which turned into fundamental categories as a result of philosophical and scientific reflection. Science is the center of modern civilization, changing the shape and setting the vector of its development. During the study of the factors that had influence on the formation and development of science, researchers more often pay attention to the role of sociocultural ones and rarely turn to the analysis of their origins, rooted in the pre-reflective, pre-theoretical deep layers of culture. An appeal to the mythological and philosophical foundations of science is the search and identification of the "roots", the origins that made (created) science and preserve their meaning in an implicit form at present. In this respect, the analysis of mythological images of the cultural universal "fate" is very interesting. The content of this universal is a set of mythological images - necessity and chance, law, reason, time. These images were the source of theoretical ideas in the first layer of "philosophemes" about the most general philosophical foundations of culture, the further understanding of which allowed to form fundamental categories in philosophy and science. The mythologem "fate" was formed under the influence of gnoseogenic factors, which are connected with the accumulation of experience of observing the natural world and with the cognition of the outer characteristic of the phenomena of nature, and also of sociogenic factors, which refer to the place of the individual in the social structure according to their destiny. With the growth of personal consciousness and the division of primitive society into social groups, there emerged a necessity to regulate and justify one's position in the social structure. Sociogenic factors had an overwhelming influence on the formation of the mythologem "fate" in the Greek tradition. A special emphasis in the interpretation of fate is the idea of everything being predetermined, independent of the efforts of man; the origins of this idea go back to archaic times. In mythological consciousness, there was a semantic system that generated the ideas of necessity, law, reason, time, eternity. These ideas became the subject of philosophical reflection, which resulted in a layer of special categories - logical-ontological categories. This layer of categories in scientific knowledge is a part of the philosophical foundations of science. They are primarily included in their ontological subsystem, represented by a grid of categories that serve as a matrix of understanding and cognition of the researched objects - categories of causality, necessity, law, chance, time, etc. The categorial foundations of science are a special area, which simultaneously belongs to the internal structure of science and to its infrastructure, and through it science is permanently connected with philosophy and culture.

TI  - THE PECULIARITIES OF IDEAS ABOUT LAW AND JUSTICE AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. In recent decades, scholars have shown greater research interest in aspects of legal literacy of young people regarding democratic processes in the Russian society. However, despite increasing relevance of the problem of developing and strengthening the legal awareness of modern young people, including university students, this issue has not been sufficiently studied. Meanwhile, subjective misinterpretation of the concepts of law and justice, a low level of legal culture and legal nihilism can be the causes of youth offences, as well as the factors, which distort the worldview under formation.The present publication is aimed to investigate the role of ideas about the law and justice in the structure of legal awareness of students of higher education institutions.Methodology and research methods. In the course of the empirical research, the following psychodiagnostic methods were employed: the questionnaire created on the basis of L. A. Yasyukova's and the procedures of free associations. To process the obtained data, the content analysis and the methods of mathematic statistics, the criterion f* (Fisher's angular transformation) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion. were used.Results and scientific novelty. Theoretical approaches to the problem under discussion have been analysed, according to which legal awareness is determined by the conditions of society. Instability of these conditions generates a "paradoxical personality" (M. I. Yenikeev), who accepts and rejects social norms. It is noted that the Russian legal culture is negatively affected by such factors as the dissonance between legal ideology and legal psychology, weakness of civil society institutions, deep financial and economic crisis, etc.The conducted survey manifested that the specifics of vocational education programme do not have a significant impact on the development of student perceptions of law and justice. The peculiarities of this component of legal awareness of students are revealed. The participants of the survey were convinced that the law should be fair; otherwise, it is not necessary to obey the law. The survey revealed that recognising the priority of legislation over conscience in administrative matters, the respondents believed that only just professionals should be at the head of state, regardless of their moral qualities. According to the respondents, orientation on honor and justice should be the basis of order in the society, but the participants noted the ambiguity of these concepts. On the one hand, students understand justice from the position of social balance (everyone receives what they deserve), on the other hand, they are convinced that social justice is ensured by equality. Young people are interested in the dynamics of the current legislation and believe that everyone should have basic legal knowledge, and ignorance of the law does not exempt a person from this responsibility. The respondents are sure that the law is the same for everyone and is enforceable equally by everyone; moreover, the law is designed to protect the interests of a particular per son, not society as a whole. The majority of respondents generated the estimation that the ability to defend own rights is more significant than the performance of duties. The authors of the present research draw a generalised conclusion that university students' perceptions of law and justice are inconsistent and contradictory.Practical significance. The research results can be used by teachers and psychologists of higher educational institutions, as well as by various experts to develop the programmes for formation of youth legal awareness.

TI  - Bosumtwi impact structure, Ghana: Evidence for fluidized emplacement of the ejecta
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The about 10.5 km diameter Bosumtwi impact crater is one of the youngest large impact structures on Earth. The crater rim is readily noticed on topographic maps or in satellite imagery. It defines a circular basin filled by water (Lake Bosumtwi) and lacustrine sediments. The morphology of this impact structure is also characterized by a circular plateau extending beyond the rim and up to 9-10 km from the center of the crater (about 2 crater radii). This feature comprises a shallow ring depression, also described as an annular moat, and a subdued circular ridge at its outer edge. The origin of this outermost feature could so far not be elucidated based on remote sensing data only. Our approach combines detailed topographic analysis, including roughness mapping, with airborne radiometric surveys (mapping near-surface K, Th, U concentrations) and field observations. This provides evidence that the moat and outer ring are features inherited from the impact event and represent the partially eroded ejecta layer of the Bosumtwi impact structure. The characteristics of the outer ridge indicate that ejecta emplacement was not purely ballistic but requires ejecta fluidization and surface flow. The setting of Bosumtwi ejecta can therefore be considered as a terrestrial analog for rampart craters, which are common on Mars and Venus, and also found on icy bodies of the outer solar system (e.g., Ganymede, Europa, Dione, Tethys, and Charon). Future studies at Bosumtwi may therefore help to elucidate the mechanism of formation of rampart craters.

TI  - An adaptive machine learning approach to improve automatic iceberg detection from SAR images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Iceberg distribution, dispersion and melting patterns are fundamental aspects in the balance of heat and freshwater in the Southern Ocean; yet these features are not fully understood. This lack of understanding is, in part, due to the difficulties in accurately identifying icebergs in different environmental conditions. To improve the understanding, reliable iceberg detection tools are necessary to achieve a detailed picture of iceberg drift and disintegration patterns, an thus to gain further information on the freshwater input into the Southern Ocean. Here, we present an accurate automatic large-scale iceberg detection method using an alternative machine learning architecture applied to high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Our method is based on the concept of adaptability and focuses on improving the performance of identifying icebergs in ambiguous environmental contexts with wide radiometric, textural, size and shape variability. The fundamentals of the method are centred on superpixel segmentation, ensemble learning and incremental learning. The method is applied to a dataset containing 586 ENVISAT Advanced SAR images acquired during 2003-2005 (Weddell Sea region) and to the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) mosaic, covering the Antarctic wide near coastal zone. These images cover scenes under heterogenous backscattering signatures for all seasons with variable meteorological, oceanographic and acquisition parameters (e.g. band, polarization). Our method is highly adaptable to distinguish icebergs from ambiguous objects hidden in the images. The average false positive rate and miss rate are 2.3 +/- 0.4% and 3.3 +/- 0.4%, respectively. Overall, 9512 icebergs with sizes varying from 0.1 to 4567.82 km(2) are detected with average classification accuracy of 97.5 +/- 0.6%. The results confirm that the method presented here is robust for widespread iceberg detection in the Antarctic seas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF REFORMED THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the late 1970s and '80s, a new generation of Chinese poets emerged with a powerful critique of the state's aggressive political reforms. After the 1976 Tiananmen Square incident, the Bejing poet Zaho Zhenkai (known as Bei Dao) wrote a startling poem titled "The Answer" about his refusal to believe in the unquestioned ultimacy of China's worldview. Bei Dao's unique style of poetry helped readers make new associations that were otherwise inaccessible to them. This article examines Bei Dao's use of metaphor in "The Answer" through the lens of the aesthetic philosopher Lambert Zuidervaart and suggests that the poet's use of self-controverting metaphors makes an absent reality graspable and present. The article then considers the role of public theology as it listens to the witness of the poet's bewildering evocation of accessing "the real" through disbelief. In consideration of Herman Bavinck's essay On Contemporary Ethics, this article suggests that theologians (and religious practitioners) should resist the temptation to control the artist's expression even when it limps with narcissism and moral deficiency. Instead, the theologian (and the church) should fight alongside the artist in helping them to share their staggering vision or, in Bei Dao's case, the transcendent power of resiliency sustained by the shadows of the dead. This article aims to generate a fruitful dialogue between Bei Dao and the Reformed theological tradition that underscores the uncanny importance of disbelief as an alternative strategy for cultural transformation and faithful proclamation.

TI  - Modeling the Net Primary Productivity: A Study Case in the Brazilian Territory
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The net primary productivity is one of the main indicators of an ecosystem's health. The objectives of the present study were to assess the performance of machine learning techniques in net primary productivity modeling and to assess regional trends for the Brazilian territory. Net primary production was modeled using evapotranspiration estimates, the normalized difference vegetation index, hypsometry and meteorological data. The models adopted for estimating net primary productivity were stepwise regression, Bayesian regularized neural network and Cubist regression. A linear trend model was applied pixel by pixel in order to verify a significant change in net primary productivity across the Brazilian territory. The Cubist model performed best among the evaluated models, with root-mean-squared error of 135.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and R-2 equal to 0.78. While assessing the net primary productivity time series, an increased trend was observed for the Brazilian Savannah biome, which may be attributed to the replacement of some Savannah formations and degraded grasslands to agriculture. The developed model has shown a great potential for filling the gap of spatial net primary productivity data in large scales.

TI  - Evaluation of Aerosol Optical Thickness over Malaysia Based on Multi-Source Ground and Satellite Data
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over Malaysia. The significance of aerosols in regional and global climate change assessment has become a pressing topic in recent climate discussions. Two different approaches are used in measuring AOT; satellite imagery and ground measurement approaches. However, the satellite approach is deemed the best way for monitoring the patterns and transport of aerosols largely due to its extensive spatial coverage and reliable repetitive measurements. The data in this study were obtained from a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), a Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors based on a NASA-operated Giovanni portal. Ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) datasets from two sites over the study area were also used. The results show that the highest AOT ground values of 1.93 and 2.00 were recorded in September 2015, at USM station and Kuching station, respectively. Throughout the 15 years of recorded data, the monthly average value of AOT reached its highest values in September, October, and November. In these months, the value of AOT went above 0.40, unlike in other months of the year. Significantly, the results indicate that Malaysian air quality can be evaluated based on AOT values, as these show the variation in optical properties of aerosol.

TI  - Detailed agricultural land classification in the Brazilian cerrado based on phenological information from dense satellite image time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The paradox between environmental conservation and economic development is a challenge for Brazil, where there is a complex and dynamic agricultural scenario. This reinforces the need for effective methods for the detailed mapping of agriculture. In this work, we employed land surface phenological metrics derived from dense satellite image time series to classify agricultural land in the Cerrado biome. We used all available Landsat images between April 2013 and April 2017, applying a weighted ensemble of Radial Basis Function (RBF) convolution filters as a kernel smoother to fill data gaps such as cloud cover and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off data. Through this approach, we created a dense Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data cube with an 8-day temporal resolution and derived phenometrics for a Random Forest (RF) classification. We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. Most of the classes showed accuracies higher than 90%. Single crop and Non-commercial crop classes presented lower accuracies. However, we showed that phenometrics derived from dense Landsat-like image time series, in a hierarchical classification scheme, has a great potential for detailed agricultural mapping. The results are promising and show that the method is consistent and robust, being applicable to mapping agricultural land throughout the entire Cerrado.

TI  - An amazing twist for science
T2  - ESPACIO ABIERTO
M3  - Article
AB  - This text exhibits as a core motivation the elementary evidence that humanity, as a whole, designs for itself, and follows in its actions, the guidelines of an armed worldview particularly to serve the dominant mode of production. The surprising thing is that this gigantic reference, substantive to social knowledge, always suffers from remarkable inconsistencies and lawlessness, despite its crucial destiny. In Whitehead's words, it is made up of "inert ideas" or disconnected pieces of information. From the late emergence of the Reason in the homo, social practices are mixed, in full experiential interaction, with the ideologies that gradually adhere to them, taking joint historical body. That vast profile has been studied very poorly by philosophy, including the Marxist; and equally, with intolerable cortitude, for new science. The mode of recognition invariably follows the routines imposed by reason, inappropriate for such a complex commitment. Therefore, we launch ourselves to defend a more organic trait in us and in the universe that influences us omnimodo: the Intelligence of species, which exhibits two immense virtues. It is the manager of all human creativity of real importance for having the dialectical ability to relate infinity of variables, in a multitude of ways. Additionally, it entails similar sense charges entirely with all nature. We do not have a problem of only intension but of understanding, and for that science must be present. A challenge to which we intend to respond by subtracting ourselves from the admitted theorization, which definitely seems inappropriate.

TI  - Retrieval of Suspended Particulate Matter in Inland Waters with Widely Differing Optical Properties Using a Semi-Analytical Scheme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) directly affects the underwater light field and, as a consequence, changes the water clarity and can reduce the primary production. Remote sensing-based bio-optical modeling can provide efficient monitoring of the spatiotemporal dynamics of SPM in inland waters. In this paper, we present a novel and robust bio-optical model to retrieve SPM concentrations for inland waters with widely differing optical properties (the Tiete River Cascade System (TRCS) in Brazil). In this system, high levels of Chl-a concentration of up to 700 mg/m(3), turbidity up to 80 NTU and high CDOM absorption highly complicate the optical characteristics of the surface water, imposing an additional challenge in retrieving SPM concentration. Since K-d is not susceptible to the saturation issue encountered when using remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), we estimate SPM concentrations via K-d. K-d was derived analytically from inherent optical properties (IOPs) retrieved through a re-parameterized quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) that yields relevant accuracy. Our model improved the estimates of the IOPs by up to 30% when compared to other existing QAAs. Our developed bio-optical model using K-d(655) was capable of describing 74% of SPM variations in the TRCS, with average error consistently lower than 30%.

TI  - Role of immunoreactive patterns of lymph nodes in neck dissection cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma: a clinical and histopathological study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN ASSOCIATION OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) can occur in a variety of ways, and draining lymphatics and lymph nodes serve as a common route. Prior to metastasis, lymph nodes elicit an immune response to either wall off or create a favorable environment for homing of tumor cells. This immune response to tumor stimuli is visualized by recognizing various immunoreactive patterns exhibited by the lymph node. The present study aims to evaluate the role of immuno-morphologic patterns of the lymph node in neck dissection for cases of OSCC.Materials and Methods: Our retrospective study included 50 neck dissection cases of OSCC and a total of 1,078 lymph nodes. The grades of primary tumors with eight different immunoreactive patterns were compared. Vascularity and metastasis in lymph nodes were also evaluated.Results: The lymphocyte predominant pattern was the most common immunoreactive pattern found in 396 of 1,078 lymph nodes. Patterns of lymphocyte predominant (P=0.0005), sinus histiocytosis (P=0.0500), paracortical hyperplasia (P=0.0001), cortical hyperplasia (P=0.0001), and increased vascularity (P=0.0190) were significantly associated with tumor grade.Conclusion: The present study adds to the understanding of lymph node immunoreactivity patterns and their correlation with tumor grade. We recommend hardier study of lymph node patterns for all sentinel lymph node biopsies and routine neck dissections for OSCCs.

TI  - Estimating 2009-2017 Impervious Surface Change in Gwadar, Pakistan Using the HJ-1A/B Constellation, GF-1/2 Data, and the Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. At the end of the CPEC, the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea is being built quickly, providing an important economical route for the flow of Central Asia's natural resources to the world. Gwadar city is in a rapid urbanization process and will be developed as a modern, world-class port city in the near future. Therefore, monitoring the urbanization process of Gwadar at both high spatial and temporal resolution is vital for its urban planning, city ecosystem management, and the sustainable development of CPEC. The impervious surface percentage (ISP) is an essential quantitative indicator for the assessment of urban development. Through the integration of remote sensing images and ISP estimation models, ISP can be routinely and periodically estimated. However, due to clouds' influence and spatial-temporal resolution trade-offs in sensor design, it is difficult to estimate the ISP with both high spatial resolution and dense temporal frequency from only one satellite sensor. In recent years, China has launched a series of Earth resource satellites, such as the HJ (Huangjing, which means environment in Chinese)-1A/B constellation, showing great application potential for rapid Earth surface mapping. This study employs the Random Forest (RF) method for a long-term and fine-scale ISP estimation and analysis of the city of Gwadar, based on the density in temporal and multi-source Chinese satellite images. In the method, high spatial resolution ISP reference data partially covering Gwadar city was first extracted from the 1-2 meter (m) GF (GaoFen, which means high spatial resolution in Chinese)-1/2 fused images. An RF retrieval model was then built based on the training samples extracted from ISP reference data and multi-temporal 30-m HJ-1A/B satellite images. Lastly, the model was used to generate the 30-m time series ISP from 2009 to 2017 for the whole city area based on the HJ-1A/B images. Results showed that the mean absolute error of the estimated ISP was 6.1-8.1% and that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimation results was 12.82-15.03%, indicating the consistently high performance of the model. This study highlights the feasibility and potential of using multi-source Chinese satellite images and an RF model to generate long-term ISP estimations for monitoring the urbanization process of the key node city in the CPEC.

TI  - First Trimester Exposure to Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents: A Utilization Study of 4.6 Million US Pregnancies
T2  - RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The safety of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure during pregnancy has not been established, and the use of GBCAs during pregnancy is not recommended unless it is essential to the health of the woman or fetus.Purpose: To examine the prevalence of GBCA exposure in a large sample of pregnancies resulting in a live birth.Materials and Methods: The Sentinel Distributed Database was used to retrospectively identify U.S. pregnancies that resulted in live births between 2006 and 2017 from 16 data partners. The main outcome was the prevalence of MRI procedures with and without GBCAs, sorted by anatomic location and trimester, among pregnant and matched comparator women.Results: Among 4692744 pregnancies resulting in a live birth, we identified 6879 exposures to GBCAs in 5457 pregnancies, representing one contrast-enhanced MRI examination per 860 pregnancies (0.12% of all pregnancies). Most contrast-enhanced MRI examinations were performed in the head (n = 3499), although pelvic and abdominal MRI constituted 22.3% (n = 1536) of all contrast-enhanced MRI examinations during pregnancy. The majority (70.2%) of GBCA exposures occurred during the first trimester, with a 4.3-fold greater prevalence compared with that in the second trimester and a 5.1-fold greater prevalence compared with that in the third trimester.Conclusion: This study identified higher rates of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure during the first few weeks of pregnancy compared with the later weeks of pregnancy, suggesting inadvertent exposure to GBCAs might occur before pregnancy is recognized.

The validity of addressing the indicated problem is confirmed by the presence of a special vocabulary in the writer's texts (Kerzhaks, dissenters, dvuperstniki [those crossing themselves with two fingers], Archpriest Avvakum, Patriarch Nikon, the Kerzhenets River, the Solovetsky Monastery, "old" and "new" faith). In addition to the obvious references to the Old Believers, the texts contain motifs and images, implicitly referring to the Old Believers (Belovodye, the hidden church). The study showed that the Old Believer culture is a sign of a specific real time (17th century) and place (Siberia) in Shukshin's artistic world. In the writer's spiral model of time, the Split of the 17th century "rhymes" with other periods of national discord (the era of princely civil strife in the 12th century, the revolution and civil war at the beginning of the 20th century). The history of the Old Believers is associated with the history of the Russian development of Siberia, the ethnogenesis of the Russian Siberian. To some extent, the "Old Believer" element of a Shukshin character is synonymous to the "Siberian" (narrower to "Altaian", broader to "inherently Russian") one. Shukshin extensively addresses the topic of the Split in his novel I Came to Give You Freedom about the events of the 12th century: in the images of Avvakum and Nikon, Razin's dialogue with the "patriarch" about the essence of the "old" and "new" faith, the Solovetsky Monastery. Intra-confessional disputes do not become the subject of the writer's reflection. The solution of the question of faith in general and of freedom as liberation from the Christian dogma is much more significant for him. The Solovetsky Monastery, in its real and virtual realization, organizes the plot of Razin's "liberation" from the shackles of religion that constrain his freedom. The Old Believer culture is a specific manifestation of the leading issues of the writer's works: freedom-as-feast and the axiological normative institutions that limit it (church, family, state, etc.). Thus, the results of the study showed that, although the Old Believer culture is not the leading component of Shukshin's works, its traces are found in the space-time and character organization of the writer's artistic world. They are included in the problem field of larger worldview questions: freedom-as-feast, faith in God, life and death.

TI  - Aerial-trained deep learning networks for surveying cetaceans from satellite imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most cetacean species are wide-ranging and highly mobile, creating significant challenges for researchers by limiting the scope of data that can be collected and leaving large areas un-surveyed. Aerial surveys have proven an effective way to locate and study cetacean movements but are costly and limited in spatial extent. Here we present a semi-automated pipeline for whale detection from very high-resolution (sub-meter) satellite imagery that makes use of a convolutional neural network (CNN). We trained ResNet, and DenseNet CNNs using down-scaled aerial imagery and tested each model on 31 cm-resolution imagery obtained from the WorldView-3 sensor. Satellite imagery was tiled and the trained algorithms were used to classify whether or not a tile was likely to contain a whale. Our best model correctly classified 100% of tiles with whales, and 94% of tiles containing only water. All model architectures performed well, with learning rate controlling performance more than architecture. While the resolution of commercially-available satellite imagery continues to make whale identification a challenging problem, our approach provides the means to efficiently eliminate areas without whales and, in doing so, greatly accelerates ocean surveys for large cetaceans.

TI  - RadCalNet: A Radiometric Calibration Network for Earth Observing Imagers Operating in the Visible to Shortwave Infrared Spectral Range
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration approaches using in situ measurements saw first use in the early 1980s and have since improved to keep pace with the evolution of the radiometric requirements of the sensors that are being calibrated. The advantage of in situ measurements for vicarious calibration is that they can be carried out with traceable and quantifiable accuracy, making them ideal for interconsistency studies of on-orbit sensors. The recent development of automated sites to collect the in situ data has led to an increase in the available number of datasets for sensor calibration. The current work describes the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) that is an effort to provide automated surface and atmosphere in situ data as part of a network including multiple sites for the purpose of optical imager radiometric calibration in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range. The key goals of RadCalNet are to standardize protocols for collecting data, process to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and provide uncertainty budgets for automated sites traceable to the international system of units. RadCalNet is the result of efforts by the RadCalNet Working Group under the umbrella of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) and the Infrared Visible Optical Sensors (IVOS). Four radiometric calibration instrumented sites located in the USA, France, China, and Namibia are presented here that were used as initial sites for prototyping and demonstrating RadCalNet. All four sites rely on collection of data for assessing the surface reflectance as well as atmospheric data over that site. The data are converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance within RadCalNet and provided through a web portal to allow users to either radiometrically calibrate or verify the calibration of their sensors of interest. Top-of-atmosphere reflectance data with associated uncertainties are available at 10 nm intervals over the 400 nm to 1000 nm spectral range at 30 min intervals for a nadir-viewing geometry. An example is shown demonstrating how top-of-atmosphere data from RadCalNet can be used to determine the interconsistency between two sensors.

TI  - The Influence of Temperature and Community Structure on Light Absorption by Phytoplankton in the North Atlantic
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a model that estimates the spectral phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(ph) (lambda)) of four phytoplankton groups (picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, dinoflagellates, and diatoms) as a function of the total chlorophyll-a concentration (C) and sea surface temperature (SST). Concurrent data on a(ph) (lambda) (at 12 visible wavelengths), C and SST, from the surface layer (<20 m depth) of the North Atlantic Ocean, were partitioned into training and independent validation data, the validation data being matched with satellite ocean-colour observations. Model parameters (the chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients of the four groups) were tuned using the training data and found to compare favourably (in magnitude and shape) with results of earlier studies. Using the independent validation data, the new model was found to retrieve total a(ph) (lambda) with a similar performance to two earlier models, using either in situ or satellite data as input. Although more complex, the new model has the advantage of being able to determine a(ph) (lambda) for four phytoplankton groups and of incorporating the influence of SST on the composition of the four groups. We integrate the new four-population absorption model into a simple model of ocean colour, to illustrate the influence of changes in SST on phytoplankton community structure, and consequently, the blue-to-green ratio of remote-sensing reflectance. We also present a method of propagating error through the model and illustrate the technique by mapping errors in group-specific a(ph) (lambda) using a satellite image. We envisage the model will be useful for ecosystem model validation and assimilation exercises and for investigating the influence of temperature change on ocean colour.

TI  - Comparison of bathymetric data sources used in hydraulic modelling of floods
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic data plays an essential role in hydraulic modelling of floods. A high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) including river bathymetry (bed topography) is required. DEMs can be derived from such various data sources as ground surveying or remote sensing techniques. This study is focused on (a) the DEM error that results from the inability to scan the morphology of the channel using remote sensing methods, and (b) assessment of its impact on the results of a one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic model. DEMs produced by remote sensing techniques were tested in combination with ground surveying and by software-updated remote sensing data. Differences in riverbed representation and thalweg position were evaluated. The 1D hydraulic model HEC-RAS was chosen to determine the impact of various DEM sources on the hydraulic quantities (water surface elevation, inundation area). The study was carried out on a reach of the River Vltava (Czech Republic). The best results were achieved by DEMs that combined remote sensing data with ground mapping. Good results also were obtained using software-updated remote sensing data. Neglecting of cross-sectional area in remote sensing data has an important impact on the results of hydrodynamic models.

T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The 16th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference 2019 in Vienna, Austria reviewed substantial new evidence on loco-regional and systemic therapies for early breast cancer.Design: Treatments were assessed in light of their intensity, duration and side-effects, estimating the magnitude of clinical benefit according to stage and biology of the disease. The Panel acknowledged that for many patients, the impact of adjuvant therapy or the adherence to specific guidelines may have modest impact on the risk of breast cancer recurrence or overall survival. For that reason, the Panel explicitly encouraged clinicians and patients to routinely discuss the magnitude of benefit for interventions as part of the development of the treatment plan.Results: The guidelines focus on common ductal and lobular breast cancer histologies arising in generally healthy women. Special breast cancer histologies may need different considerations, as do individual patients with other substantial health considerations. The panelists' opinions reflect different interpretation of available data and expert opinion where is lack of evidence and sociocultural factors in their environment such as availability of and access to medical service, economic resources and reimbursement issues. Panelists encourage patient participation in well-designed clinical studies whenever available.Conclusions: With these caveats in mind, the St. Gallen Consensus Conference seeks to provide guidance to clinicians on appropriate treatments for early-stage breast cancer and guidance for weighing the realistic tradeoffs between treatment and toxicity so that patients and clinical teams can make well-informed decisions on the basis of an honest reckoning of the magnitude of clinical benefit.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - CFAR detection algorithm is widely used in the typical target detection of SAR images. In SAR image target detection, the simple statistical distribution models, such as Gaussian distribution, normal distribution, Weibull distribution etc., are obviously not suitable for the fitting of the background clutter distribution of missile-borne SAR images, and the G(0) distribution is suitable for extremely unstable regions and its expression is relatively simple. A two-stage CFAR detector with G(0) distribution is designed and the distribution of ground SAR images is statistically analysed by using the CA-CFAR detector. A target in a relatively non-homogenous background usually has a long tail, and the detection results of the two-stage CFAR detector based on the G(0) distribution are much better.

TI  - Geographical Modeling of Spatial Interaction between Built-Up Land Sprawl and Cultivated Landscape Eco-Security under Urbanization Gradient
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up land sprawl is the most intuitive manifestation and main cause of cultivated land pattern change. Understanding spatiotemporal change and its driving factors in the impact of built-up land sprawl on cultivated landscape eco-security under the urbanization gradient can reveal the nature of cultivated landscape ecological risk caused by urban sprawl and promote the scientific implementation of urban planning and cultivated land protection policies. Taking Yangzhou, a medium-sized city with rapid urbanization, as an example, we used multi-sources data (30 m resolution Landsat images in 1998, 2008, and 2018) to analyze the sprawl intensity and direction of built-up land and cultivated landscape ecological risk areas under the urbanization gradient and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the relationship between them. Further, we employed the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to quantify the effects of geographic, social, and economic factors on the impact of built-up land sprawl on cultivated landscape eco-security under different urbanization gradients. Results showed that built-up land sprawl rate increased first and then decreased from 1998 to 2018, forming the sprawl gradients of no. 1-8, no. 8-16, and no. 16-30 urban circle. Its sprawl direction is mainly 20 degrees-90 degrees, 190 degrees-240 degrees, and 305 degrees-355 degrees, whereas cultivated landscape ecological risk area is a continuous sprawl, and the sprawl gradient and direction of the main risk area are consistent with the built-up land. In 1998-2008, the main areas where built-up land sprawl affects cultivated landscape eco-security are located in no. 1-16 urban circle, 20 degrees-55 degrees. From 2008 to 2018, it was located in no. 16-26 urban circle, 305 degrees-355 degrees. In this process, the influence of geospatial factors decreases gradually over time but increases outwardly with the urbanization gradient. The influence of social factors decreases first with time and then increases with the urbanization gradient outward in space. Economic factors increase with time but decrease with the urbanization gradient. The influence of each factor varies greatly over time and with the urbanization gradient.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the impact of the Ningbo North Dyke (NND) built in 2012-2014 in the coastal waterway of East China Sea on local suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Several multi-spectral satellite images acquired by the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) in 2008-2017 were used. We analyzed the change of SSC and spectral curves of study area around small NND (the NND's total length less than 1 km) using a prior model proposed in our previous study. We found that SSC near NND in the Meishan Waterway decreased after the NND construction by 200-300 mg/l, so that clean blue water is now observed in the Meishan Waterway, apparently thanks to stable dynamic environment in presence of NND. Our results reveal the impact of a small coastal dyke with length less than 1 km on the movement and distribution of SSC from a remote-sensing perspective. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - First report of the prevalence and genotype of <i>Trypanosoma</i> spp. in bats in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Trypanosome is considered as one of important parasites in almost all mammalian species, which occurs in Chiroptera throughout the world. Although numerous trypanosome species have been identified in bats in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, little is known about the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of trypanosomes in Chinese bat. Recently, some human Trypanosoma cruzi infection attributed to a bat-related T. cruzi (TcBat) from the Noctilio spp., Myotis spp. and Artibeus spp was found. Consequently, it is a necessity to know trypanosome species in bats from China.In order to determine the prevalence and genotypes in bat from southwestern China, wehere detected trypanosomes prevalence 227bat brain tissue samples, including 60 Rousettus leschenaultia, 58 Hipposideros Pomona, 69 Rhinolophus pusillus, 40 Myotis daubentonni in Yunnan Province of China using nested PCR based on 18S rRNA. 14 (6.2%) of them were trypanosmes positive including 13 insect-eating bats and 1 fruit bat. The prevalence of trypanosome in R.leschenaultia, H. Pomona, and R.pusillus was 1.67%(1/60), 6.90%(4/58) and 13.0%(9/69), respectively (P < 0.01), suggesting R. pusillus was a main-vector host bat. The positive rate of T.sp, T. dionisii, T.brucei brucei and T.sp ZY-2 was 4.8% (11/227), 0.4%(1/227), 0.4%(1/227), and 0.4% (1/227), resepectively. These results showed that T.sp-Yunnan is the predominant genospecies. To our knowledge, this is the first report about Trypanosome species in bats in Yunnan Province, southwestern China.

TI  - A patch-based algorithm for global and daily burned area mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing availability of dense time series of moderate spatial resolution satellite data for mapping global burned areas calls for mapping algorithms designed to easily integrate data at different spatial and temporal resolutions, irrespective of particular grid constraints. In this paper, we describe a novel hybrid approach for global burned area mapping that combines active fire data and time series of surface reflectance using graphs, which provide a flexible and efficient way of extracting spatiotemporal consistent patches.Our approach has three main steps. Firstly, we analyze burn-sensitive vegetation index time series to determine for each location a set of events, which are the dates for which the spectral-temporal signal indicates the possibility of a burn. Secondly, we explore the spatiotemporal distribution of all events and active fires to determine a subset of events with strong evidence of corresponding to burned areas. Those events are used as positive occurrences for training a one-class maximum entropy classifier and obtain, for each candidate event, a likelihood of it actually corresponding to a burn. Finally, we build a graph that combines all previous information, from which we extract spatiotemporal patches of densely connected events. Patches with strong evidence of burning determine the burned area map at any given time period.This research is part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) and aims ultimately at generating Sentinel-3 daily global burned area products at 500 m spatial resolution. Towards that end, we test our approach with spatially and spectrally similar MODIS gridded surface reflectance (MOD/MYDO9GA), as well as non-gridded active fire (MCD14ML) 2008 data and CCI global land cover maps. Using 105 independent Landsat fire reference perimeters to validate global results, we show that our algorithm applied to MOD/MYDO9GA data (PT-M09) has very similar accuracy (44%) measured by the Dice coefficient compared with MCD64A1 v006 (45%). Moreover, PT-M09 exhibits a higher commission error but a lower omission error than MCD64A1. Due to their coarse resolution, this kind of product cannot capture very small burn areas. The bias relative to the reference burned area indicates that the algorithm presented in the current study underestimates burned area by 14% of the area actually burned according to reference data, which is lower than the underestimation in MCD64A1 (28%).We also analyzed the temporal accuracy of the patch based algorithm and concluded that the average time difference to active fires detection is 3.43 days, which is similar to MCD64A1 (3.75 days). Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis which shows that total mapped burned areas varies only 3% when the main algorithm threshold that separates "burned" and "unburned" patches varies from quantile 45% to 55%.

TI  - Bundle adjustment of satellite images based on an equivalent geometric sensor model with digital elevation model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision georeferencing of satellite stereo images becomes a key issue in multi-source data integration, geometric processing, and analysis for many remote sensing applications. Using existing geographic data, including readily available public data, as geometric reference for georeferencing satellite imagery is an effective and feasible way to improve the positional accuracy and reduce the costs and workforce restrictions on ground control points (GCPs) acquisition. This study proposes a novel bundle adjustment approach of push broom satellite imagery based on an equivalent geometric sensor model (EGSM). As an extension of the collinearity equations, EGSM is equivalent to the rigorous geometric sensor model, whose interior and exterior orientation parameters have clear geometric interpretations. The initial values of EGSM's parameters can be completely recovered from the RPCs and optimized within the block adjustment without using any metadata of the satellite imagery. Furthermore, a publicly accessible digital elevation model (DEM) is used as constraints in the bundle adjustment to improve the direct georeferencing accuracies without GCPs. A set of pseudo observation equations is incorporated into the EGSM associated with appropriate weights based on the estimated variance of height differences between the tie points and the DEM surface. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated by using 143 stereo scenes of Chinese Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) images and the global DEM data SRTM GL3, ASTER GDEM, and AW3D30. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach could improve not only vertical accuracies but also horizontal accuracies of satellite stereo images. The geopositional accuracy after adjustment is dependent on the quality and accuracy of the reference DEM itself. With AW3D30 as exclusive controls, the horizontal and vertical root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the experimental images are reduced from 17.3 m and 2.6 m to 2.5 m and 1.5 m, respectively. The horizontal accuracy corresponds to about 1.2 pixels in the image space, and the vertical accuracy is about 0.6 pixels with the base-height ratio of ZY-3 stereo images being 0.81. The generazation ability of the approach was further proved by the experiments of WorldView-3 stereo images.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Characteristics During the Biomass Burning Season in Southeastern Mexico
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a characterization of the optical properties of the aerosols emitted during biomass burning (BB) season in the period 2005-2009. Trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (alpha), and precipitable water (PW) were analyzed using a 5-year dataset from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations over Tuxtla Gutierrez (TG), Chiapas. The overall mean AOD (500 nm) during the 2005-2009 period was 0.26 +/- 0.18. However, monthly mean values of AOD > 0.5 during the spring months (April and May) would indicate the high load of particles emitted by fires. The overall mean of alpha (440-870 nm) was 1.40 +/- 0.21, which confirms the presence of fine aerosols. Additionally, the combined analysis of the alpha with its spectral curvature delta alpha, and the results from the spectral de-convolution algorithm (SDA) shows that fine-mode aerosols dominated AOD variability in TG. In this paper, the trajectories of air masses (400 and 1500 m, a.s.l.) arriving at the TG site were classified by using backward trajectory cluster analysis. Trajectory clustering results indicate a BB regional transport from Central America that affects the atmosphere in southeastern Mexico. We use observations of fire radiative power (FRP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to study the incidence of wildfires and to estimate the BB emissions from 2005 to 2009 in southeastern Mexico. The results indicated a gradual decrease in fires throughout the years. Campeche and Yucatan are the states in southeastern Mexico where BB produces the highest emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), and particulate material PM2.5. However, the largest emissions come from wildfires in Guatemala. Finally, to put in context the aerosol optical properties over southeastern Mexico, the sun photometric measurements in TG are compared with those retrieved from AERONET stations located in other tropical biomass burning regions (Brazil and Zambia).

TI  - <i>Helix aspersa</i> as sentinel of development damage for biomonitoring purpose: A validation study
T2  - MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Environmental health has always been threatened by the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the terrestrial ecosystem, affecting its quality and safety. The aim of this review is to investigate the effects of heavy metal soil contamination, using the land snail Helix aspersa as a bioindicator. H. aspersa, a common species of land snail present in the area, has been used as a bioindicator of metal contamination and represents a promising ecological indicator. Various land snails species have become popular in microcosm studies because they accumulate high concentrations of certain trace metals. They express contamination as a whole through ingestion of polluted foods, such as live plants, microorganisms, soil, and water and also through cutaneous contact and from the polluted air they breathe. Land snails are considered appropriate sentinel species because trace metals tend to accumulate in their digestive gland to allow biomonitoring of metal pollution. Different experiments demonstrate that exposure in areas chronically polluted with metals, especially with lead, often causes changes in reproduction, with a variation in the mineral composition in the snail's eggs and also in its development, due to increased energy expenses associated with detoxification and the excretion process.

TI  - Perspectives on the prediction of catastrophic slope failures from satellite InSAR
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate the potential of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to identify precursors to catastrophic slope failures. To date, early-warning has mostly relied on the availability of detailed, high-frequency data from sensors installed in situ. The same purpose could not be chased through spaceborne monitoring applications, as these could not yield information acquired in sufficiently systematic fashion. Here we present three sets of Sentinel-1 constellation images processed by means of multi-interferometric analysis. We detect clear trends of accelerating displacement prior to the catastrophic failure of three large slopes of very different nature: an open-pit mine slope, a natural rock slope in alpine terrain, and a tailings dam embankment. We determine that these events could have been located several days or weeks in advance. The results highlight that satellite InSAR may now be used to support decision making and enhance predictive ability for this type of hazard.

AB  - Creating a quantitative overview over the early Iron Age heritage of the Eurasian steppes is a difficult task due to the vastness of the ecological zone and the often problematic access. Remote sensing based detection on open-source high-resolution satellite data in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide a potential solution to this problem. We create a CNN trained to detect early Iron Age burial mounds in freely available optical satellite data. The CNN provides a superior method for archaeological site detection based on the comparison to other detection algorithms trained on the same dataset. Throughout all comparison metrics (precision, recall, and score) the CNN performs best.

TI  - The effect of urban planning on urban formations determining bioclimatic comfort area's effect using satellitia imagines on air quality: a case study of Bursa city
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Biocomfort is limit values in which people feel comfortable in environmental conditions such as wind, humidity, temperature, and precipitation. Bioclimatic comfort areas are used in urban planning, rural planning, tourism purposes, urban area's residential area, and landscape architecture. Bioclimatic comfort maps were made according to PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature) index from meteorological station; also, data were obtained from satellite images to determine the bioclimatic comfort structure of the urban area in Bursa. For this data, average wind, temperature, and relative humidity values were converted to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using ArcView GIS (TM) 10 software and create thermal perception maps. The study integrates remote sensing (RS) and GIS to analyze land cover and use change in Bursa defining bioclimatic comfort. Utilizing Landsat (7 ETM and 8 OLITIRS) satellite data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the change map was analyzed and produced in 2002-2016. The objective was to understand the suitability of Change Vector Analysis (CVA) and elevation parameters in the region. The results indicate the appropriateness of change in vector analysis. With the help of a bioclimatic comfort conditions, map taking into account the temperature, humidity, and rainfall data and bioclimatic comfort zone for the 12-year period perceived for 30 years. The result maps of the study may serve as the basis for sustainable urban planning studies for Bursa.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma in Taiwan A series of 24 cases and literature review
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. The available reports of MCC in Asia are limited; in this study, we report the largest series of MCC in Taiwan to date.The series is composed by 24 pathologically proven MCC cases, which were retrospectively reviewed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan between 2000 and 2018.The tumor occurred predominantly in men (80%) and in the elderly (median 74.8 years). Twenty-one patients had locoregional MCC and 3 had metastatic MCC at the time of diagnosis. Patients with pathologically proven negative nodes by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) showed better survival time than those without SLNB in 16 clinically node-negative MCC cases undergoing primary surgery. Salvage surgery for loco-regional recurrence lengthened the survival time and possibly cured recurrent MCC. Palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide showed a response rate of 25%, progression-free survival of 3.6 months, and overall survival of 14.8 months in 4metastatic/recurrent MCC. Avelumab treatment was effective in 1 patient, who achieved a durable disease control.This observational cohort of MCC patients in Taiwan suggests aggressive surgical intervention including wide excision and lymph node management, salvage operation is critical for early MCC patients, and palliative chemotherapy and immunotherapy showed their efficacy for advanced MCC patients.

TI  - Variations in Water Vapor From AIRS and MODIS in Response to Arctic Sea Ice Change in December 2002-November 2016
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor plays a vital role in the Arctic sea ice and climate change. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are useful tools for studying the water vapor variations over the entire Arctic. In this paper, we discuss precipitable water vapor (PWV) variations from the AIRS and MODIS Level-3 data products in response to Arctic sea ice change during December 2002-November 2016. The results indicate that both AIRS- and MODIS-derived PWV measurements tend to be underestimated, and this underestimation is generally greater for the latter than the former over both land and ocean. Additionally, both the AIRS and MODIS retrievals suggest that the atmospheres are drier in the solid sea ice pack and, to a lesser extent, in the marginal ice zone, than in the open ocean in each season. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between the PWV and sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies are generally observed in all seasons under different ice conditions except in the open ocean, where variations in the PWV may be attributed to the poleward moisture transport from lower latitudes. The Arctic PWV and SIC variation patterns are also dominated by the atmospheric and ice conditions in the solid sea ice pack, respectively. The monthly mean PWV and SIC time series analysis further reveals that the Arctic PWV variations tend to be affected by a delayed effect of approximately 1.2-1.3 months from SIC changes from a climatological perspective.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, steric height variability in the East Asian Seas (EAS) has been analyzed by using ocean reanalysis intercomparison project (ORA-IP) data. Results show that there are significant correlations between ocean reanalysis and satellite data except the phase of annual cycle and interannual signals of the Yellow Sea. Reanalysis ensemble derived from 15-different assimilation systems depicts higher correlation (0.706) than objective analysis ensemble (0.296) in the EAS. This correlation coefficient is also much higher than that of the global ocean (0.441). For the long-term variability of the thermosteric sea level during 1993-2010, a significant warming trend is found in the East/Japan Sea, while cooling trend is shown around the Kuroshio extension area. For the halosteric sea level, a dominant freshening trend is found in the EAS. However, below 300 m depth around this area, the signal-to-noise ratio of the linear trend is generally less than one, which is related to the low density of observation data.

AB  - Surgery remains an essential step in the treatment of breast cancers, which are mostly diagnosed at early stages thanks to the screening.The evolution of breast cancer surgery is heading for a de-escalation in accordance with scientific data and patient expectations in terms of quality of life.At the mammary level, the evolution towards a conservative surgery is reinforced by complex surgical techniques (oncoplasty) and systemic neoadjuvant treatments.At the ganglionic level, sentinel lymph node dissection progressively replaces axillary dissection without loss of chance for the patients, making it possible to reduce the axillary morbidity.The place of breast reconstruction is growing although a majority of patients do not carry it out. Works need to be continued to understand this rate (less than 30% of patients). Failure of information? Fear of relapse? Medical misunderstanding?

TI  - Cross-sectional evaluation of emergency care capacity at public hospitals in Zambia
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The last decade has seen rapid expansion of emergency care systems across Africa, although they remain underdeveloped. In Zambia, the Ministry of Health has taken interest in improving the situation and data are needed to appropriately guide system strengthening efforts. The Emergency Care Assessment Tool (ECAT) provides a context-specific means of measuring capacity of healthcare facilities in low- and middle-income countries. We evaluated Zambian public hospitals using the ECAT to inform resource-effective improvements to the nation's healthcare system. Methods The ECAT was administered to the lead clinician in the emergency unit at 23 randomly sampled public hospitals across seven of Zambia's 10 provinces in March 2016. Data were collected regarding hospitals' perceived abilities to perform a number of predefined signal functions - life-saving procedures that encompass the need for both skills and resources. Signal functions (36 for intermediate facilities, 51 for advanced) related to six sentinel conditions that represent a large burden of morbidity and mortality from emergencies. We report the proportion of procedures that each level of hospital was capable of, along with barriers to delivery of care. Results Across all hospitals, most of the levelappropriate emergency care procedures could be performed. Intermediate level (district) hospitals were able to perform 75% (95% CI 73.2 to 76.8) of signal functions for the six conditions. Among advanced level hospitals, provincial hospitals were able to perform 68.6% (67.4% to 69.7%) and central hospitals 96.1% (95% CI 93.5 to 98.7) Main failures in delivery of care were attributed to a lack of healthcare worker training and availability of consumable resources, such as medicines or supplies. Conclusion Zambian public hospitals have reasonable capacity to care for acutely ill and injured patients; however, there is a need for increased training and improved supply chains.

TI  - An enhanced bloom index for quantifying floral phenology using multi-scale remote sensing observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floral phenology, the timing and intensity of flowering, is intimately tied to the reproduction of terrestrial ecosystem and highly sensitive to climate change. However, observational records of flowering are very sparse, limiting our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of floral phenology from local to regional scales. Satellite remote sensing provides unique opportunities to monitor flowers through space and time in a cost-effective way. Here we developed an enhanced bloom index (EBI), based on the multispectral remotely sensed data, to quantify flowering status over almond (Prunus dulcis) orchards in Central Valley of California. Our test studies with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery at 2.6-5.2 cm demonstrated that the EBI enhanced the signals of flowers and reduced the background noise from soil and green vegetation, and agreed well with the bloom coverage derived from supervised classification, with a R-2 of 0.72. Experimental tests with multi-scale remote sensing observations from CERES aerial (0.2 m), PlanetScope (3 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), and Landsat (30 m) satellite imagery further showed the robustness of the EBI in capturing the flower information. We found that the relatively dense time series of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery were able to capture the bloom dynamics of almond orchards. Satellite derived EBI is expected to track the bloom information and thus improve our understanding and prediction of flower and pollination response to weather and ultimately the yield.

TI  - Expression and Pathological Significance of Cathepsin L in the Brain Tissue of Rats with Intracerebral Hemorrhage
T2  - Journal of China Medical University
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We studied the expression and pathological significance of cathepsin L (Cat L) in the brain tissue of rats with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods Adult male SPF Wistar rats (n = 135) were randomly selected to either receive a stereotactic injection of 100 mu L autologous arterial blood (n = 90) or sterile saline (n = 45) into the right basal ganglia. The rats who were injected with blood were then randomly allocated to one of two groups; Z-FY-CHO or ICH. Rats in the Z-FY-CHO group were treated with Z-FY-CHO dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 2 mu L, 1 mu g/mu L) intracerebroyentricularly, 2 hours after blood injection. Rats in the ICH group were injected with the same volume of DMSO. The expression of Cat. L in the rat brains was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 3 days after ICH. The brain water content,neurologic impairment scores, and Evans blue content were assessed at 1,3,7, and 14 days after ICH. Results Compared with rats in the sham group,those in the ICH group had higher Cat L mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Rats in the Z-FY-CHO group had a lower Cat L mRNA expression than rats in the ICH group (P < 0.05). Moreover,rats in the Z-FY-CHO group also had lower neurologic impairment scores,brain water content, and Evans blue content (P < 0.05). Conclusion Brain Cat L mRNA expression increased after experimental ICH in rats. Z-FY-CHO can inhibit the expression of Cat L and alleviate brain injury. Thus, Cat L expression appears closely related to post-ICH injury in rats.

AB  - Purpose: To determine whether Patent Blue V (PB) can be used as an alternative dye for staining Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) grafts.Methods: DMEK grafts from donor corneas were stained with 2.5% PB for 4 minutes (n = 2), 2.5% PB for 10 minutes (n = 2), or 0.06% trypan blue (TB) for 4 minutes (n = 1). The stain intensity of the grafts was compared initially and at different time points over a 15-minute period of balanced salt solution wash using a grading scale based on a serial dilution series of PB. Three additional grafts were stained with 2.5% PB for 10 minutes and used in mock surgeries to assess stain retention after injection and manipulation in a donor eye model for 25 minutes. To assess the safety of PB, DMEK grafts were prepared from 10 pairs of corneas where one cornea was stained with 0.06% TB for 4 minutes and the mate cornea was stained with 2.5% PB for 10 minutes. The grafts were preloaded and stored for 5 days in Optisol-GS at 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C, and endothelial cell loss was quantified using Calcein-AM staining and FIJI segmentation by 2 masked readers.Results: PB stain intensities were lighter than TB-stained grafts. Grafts stained with 2.5% PB for 10 minutes retained sufficient color for the 25-minute duration of mock surgery. The average endothelial cell loss for PB versus TB grafts was 21.6% +/- 5.3% versus 20.2% +/- 5.4% (P = 0.202) as determined by reader 1 and 23.6% +/- 4.8% versus 21.2% +/- 5.8% (P = 0.092) as determined by reader 2.Conclusions: PB is a viable alternative dye in DMEK grafts for applications where TB may not be available or approved for use.

TI  - Novel Hybrid Integration Approach of Bagging-Based Fisher's Linear Discriminant Function for Groundwater Potential Analysis
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a vital water source in the rural and urban areas of developing and developed nations. In this study, a novel hybrid integration approach of Fisher's linear discriminant function (FLDA) with rotation forest (RFLDA) and bagging (BFLDA) ensembles was used for groundwater potential assessment at the Ningtiaota area in Shaanxi, China. A spatial database with 66 groundwater spring locations and 14 groundwater spring contributing factors was prepared; these factors were elevation, aspect, slope, plan and profile curvatures, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance to roads and streams, land use, lithology, soil and normalized difference vegetation index. The classifier attribute evaluation method based on the FLDA model was implemented to test the predictive competence of the mentioned contributing factors. The area under curve, confidence interval at 95%, standard error, Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare and validate the success and prediction competence of the three applied models. According to the achieved results, the BFLDA model showed the most prediction competence, followed by the RFLDA and FLDA models, respectively. The resulting groundwater spring potential maps can be used for groundwater development plans and land use planning.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability and Influencing Factors of Aerosol Optical Depth over the Pan Yangtze River Delta during the 2014-2017 Period
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of aerosol particles suspended in the atmosphere pose a serious challenge to the climate and human health. In this study, we produced a dataset through merging the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometers (MODIS) Collection 6.1 3-km resolution Dark Target aerosol optical depth (DT AOD) with the 10-km resolution Deep Blue aerosol optical depth (DB AOD) data by linear regression and made use of it to unravel the spatiotemporal characteristics of aerosols over the Pan Yangtze River Delta (PYRD) region from 2014 to 2017. Then, the geographical detector method and multiple linear regression analysis were employed to investigate the contributions of influencing factors. Results indicate that: (1) compared to the original Terra DT and Aqua DT AOD data, the average daily spatial coverage of the merged AOD data increased by 94% and 132%, respectively; (2) the values of four-year average AOD were high in the north-east and low in the south-west of the PYRD; (3) the annual average AOD showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2017 while the seasonal average AOD reached its maximum in spring; and that (4) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and slope contributed most to the spatial distribution of AOD, followed by precipitation and population density. Our study highlights the spatiotemporal variability of aerosol optical depth and the contributions of different factors over this large geographical area in the four-year period, and can, therefore, provide useful insights into the air pollution control for decision makers.

TI  - Remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques in studies on treeline ecotone dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - We performed a meta-analysis on over 100 studies applying remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) to understand treeline dynamics. A literature search was performed in multiple online databases, including Web of Knowledge (Thomson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier), BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine), CAB Direct, and Google Scholar using treeline-related queries. We found that RS and GIS use has steadily increased in treeline studies since 2000. Spatial-resolution RS and satellite imaging techniques varied from low-resolution MODIS, moderate-resolution Landsat, to high-resolution WorldView and aerial orthophotos. Most papers published in the 1990s used low to moderate resolution sensors such as Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper, or SPOT PAN (Panchromatic) and MX (Multispectral) RS images. Subsequently, we observed a rise in high-resolution satellite sensors such as ALOS, GeoEye, IKONOS, and WorldView for mapping current and potential treelines. Furthermore, we noticed a shift in emphasis of treeline studies over time: earlier reports focused on mapping treeline positions, whereas RS and GIS are now used to determine the factors that control treeline variation.

TI  - A Comparison of Costs: How California Teaching Hospitals Achieved Slower Growth Than Nonteaching Hospitals in Operating Room Costs From 2005 to 2014
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Historically, teaching hospitals have had higher costs than nonteaching hospitals, introducing potential financial risk in value-based payment models. This study compared risk-adjusted operating room (OR) costs between California teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Method Using 2,992 financial statements from fiscal years (FYs) 2005-2014, the authors extracted data for OR total costs, components of direct costs, and indirect costs. Cross-sectional and longitudinal models estimated OR costs per minute of surgery by teaching status, ownership, case mix index, and geographic area. Results Risk-adjusted cost was $9.44 per minute less in teaching than nonteaching hospitals in FY 2014 (95% CI, 3.03-15.85, P = .004). Between FY 2005 and FY 2014, OR costs grew more slowly at teaching hospitals because of slower wage growth and indirect costs per minute (-$0.13 and -$0.77 per minute per year, respectively, P = .005 and P < .001). Hourly pay rose more at teaching hospitals ($0.26 per hour per year, P = .008) but was offset by slower full-time equivalents growth (-0.002 per 10,000 OR minutes per year, P = .001). Between FY 2005 and FY 2014, operative volume increased at teaching hospitals and decreased at nonteaching hospitals. Conclusions By 2014, California teaching hospitals had lower OR costs per minute than nonteaching hospitals because of relative labor productivity gains and slower indirect cost growth. The latter likely resulted from a volume shift from nonteaching to teaching facilities. These trends will help teaching hospitals compete under value-based models. Implications for patients and nonteaching hospitals warrant evaluation.

TI  - Mapping Mountain Peatlands and Wet Meadows Using Multi-Date, Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands (called bofedales in the Andes of Peru) are abundant and important components of many mountain ecosystems across the globe. They provide many benefits including water storage, high quality habitat, pasture, nutrient sinks and transformations, and carbon storage. The remote and rugged setting of mountain wetlands creates challenges for mapping, typically leading to misclassification and underestimates of wetland extent. We used multi-date, multi-sensor radar and optical imagery (Landsat TM/PALSAR/RADARSAT-1/SRTM DEM-TPI) combined with ground truthing for mapping wetlands in Huascaran National Park, Peru. We mapped bofedales into major wetland types: 1) cushion plant peatlands, 2) cushion plant wet meadows, and 3) graminoid wet meadows with an overall accuracy of 92%. A fourth wetland type was found (graminoid peatlands) but was too rare to map accurately, thus it was combined with cushion peatland to form a single peatland class. Total wetland area mapped in the National Park is 38,444 ha, which is 11% of the park area. Peatlands were the most abundant wetland type occupying 6.3% of the park, followed by graminoid wet meadows (3.5%) and cushion wet meadows (1.3%). These maps will serve as the foundation for improved management, including restoration, and estimates of landscape carbon stocks.

TI  - Cretaceous Episodic Extension in the South China Block, East Asia: Evidence From the Yuechengling Massif of Central South China
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Cretaceous, the subduction of the Izanagi/Paleo-Pacific plates beneath the South China Block (SCB) created a wide back-arc domain characterized by numerous extensional basins coeval with voluminous magmatism. The SCB witnessed the whole evolution by records of widespread extensional structures to accommodate the lithospheric stretching. In the interior of the SCB, the Yuechengling (YCL) Massif preserves a large, low-angle detachment fault, the Ziyuan Detachment (ZYD) at the western margin, and a high-angle ductile normal fault, the Tianhu Fault (THF), in the middle of the massif. Both faults display ductile shearing with top-to-the west kinematics but play different roles in two stages of extension. In the early stage at 140-120 Ma, the THF deformed the eastern YCL pluton at a temperature of similar to 350 degrees C, but the ZYD shows limited movement at this time. On the contrary, the later stage (100-85 Ma) is characterized by pervasive middle- to high-temperature deformation (similar to 400-500 degrees C) and rapid exhumation along the ZYD, but the THF only underwent a near-surface brittle overprint. Across the SCB, the two-phase extension is widely recorded in other extensional structures and coincides with magmatic flare-ups at its eastern margin, suggesting episodic changes in the subduction dip. Combined with two compressional events that took place between the intervals of extension, the SCB experienced two cycles of compression-extension at 155-120 and 120-85 Ma. This periodicity is tentatively interpreted as a combined effect from the Izanagi/Paleo-Pacific subduction angle change and a thickening-foundering process in the arc region.

TI  - Building Biosafety Capacity in Our Nation's Laboratories
T2  - HEALTH SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2014 Ebola outbreak revealed biosafety vulnerabilities across the United States. We distributed $24.1 million to health departments to support public health laboratories (PHLs) and sentinel clinical laboratory partners to improve biosafety practices. We used 9 indicators to evaluate PHLs and associated clinical laboratories from March 2015 through April 2018 using descriptive statistics. On average, over 6 reporting periods, 59 awardee PHLs and 4,040 clinical laboratories responded. By April 2018, 92% (57 of 62) of PHLs had conducted at least 1 risk assessment for work with Ebola and another highly infectious disease. The number of PHLs having a policy for risk assessments increased from 32 of 61 (52%) to 49 of 54 (91%). The percentage of awardees meeting the target (80%) for associated clinical laboratories with staff certifications to package/ship rose from 32% (19 of 60) to 46% (25 of 54). The percentage of awardees meeting the target (70%) for associated clinical laboratories with risk assessment policies increased from 18% (8 of 44) to 28% (15 of 54). Awardees reported improvement among Ebola treatment centers/Ebola assessment hospitals with policies to perform risk assessments from 48% (20 of 42) to 67% (34 of 51). Public health laboratories and their clinical partners made progress on their abilities to address biosafety concerns and implement consistent biosafety practices, improving their ability to work safely with biological threats. More attention is needed to address gaps in the clinical community. Support for biosafety activities is critical to continuing to achieve progress.

TI  - Evaluation of subsidence induced by long-lasting buildings load using InSAR technique and geotechnical data: The case study of a Freight Terminal (Tuscany, Italy)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper shows the results of the comparison between Multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (MTInSAR) products derived from different sensors (C-band ERS 1/2, Envisat, Sentinel-1 and X-band COSMO-SkyMed) and geotechnical data to investigate the driving factors of subsidence which affect a freight terminal located along the a coastal plain of Tuscany (central Italy). MTInSAR data have been acquired in a very long period, between 1992 and 2018 and were analyzed in terms of subsidence rates and deformation time series at building scale. The obtained results show that the oldest buildings are still affected by a deformation rate close to - 5 mm/yr, whereas recent buildings register rates around -40 mm/yr. Time series of deformation suggest that the deformation rates decrease over time following time-dependent trend that approximates the typical consolidation curve for compressible soils. The geotechnical and stratigraphical analysis of the subsurface data (boreholes, cone penetration tests and dilatometer tests) highlights the presence of a 15 m thick layer formed of clay characterized by poor geotechnical characteristics. The comparison among InSAR data, subsurface geological framework and geotechnical reconstruction suggests a possible evaluation of the timing of the primary and secondary consolidation processes.

TI  - Extracting Khmer Rouge Irrigation Networks from Pre-Landsat 4 Satellite Imagery Using Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Often discussed, the spatial extent and scope of the Khmer Rouge irrigation network has not been previously mapped on a national scale. Although low resolution, early Landsat images can identify water features accurately when using vegetation indices. We discuss the methods involved in mapping historic irrigation on a national scale, as well as comparing the performance of several vegetation indices at irrigation detection. Irrigation was a critical component of the Communist Part of Kampuchea (CPK)'s plan to transform Cambodia into an ideal communist society, aimed at providing surplus for the nation by tripling rice production. Of the three indices used, normalized difference, corrected transformed, and Thiam's transformed vegetation indexes, (NDVI, CTVI, and TTVI respectively), the CTVI provided the clearest images of water storage and transport. This method for identifying anthropogenic water features proved highly accurate, despite low spatial resolution. We were successful in locating and identifying both water storage and irrigation canals from the time that the CPK regime was in power. In many areas these canals and reservoirs are no longer visible, even with high resolution modern satellites. Most of the structures built at this time experienced some collapse, either during the CPK regime or soon after, however many have been rehabilitated and are still in use, in at least a partial capacity.

TI  - Identification of potential drug name confusion errors in the Sentinel System
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a drug safety communication regarding errors in prescribing and dispensing of the antidepressant Brintellix (vortioxetine) and the antiplatelet Brilinta (ticagrelor) that arose due to proprietary drug name confusion. Brintellix is indicated for major depressive disorder; Brilinta is indicated to reduce cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome or history of myocardial infarction. Brintellix was renamed to Trintellix in May 2016. Using Brilinta and Brintellix as a proof-of-concept feasibility use case, we assessed whether drug name confusion errors between the pair could be identified in electronic health care data via the combination of a claims-based algorithm and limited manual claims data review. Methods Using data from the Sentinel System, we defined potential errors as Brintellix users without an on- or off-label indication for Brintellix, without a dispensing for a drug with the same indications as Brintellix, and with an on- or off-label indication for Brilinta between -365 and +30 days after index Brintellix dispensing; the reverse was done for Brilinta. We manually reviewed claims profiles of potential cases. Results We identified 27 (0.1%) potential errors among 21 208 Brintellix users; 16 appeared to be likely errors based on claims profile review. Fifty-one (0.3%) of the 16 779 Brilinta users were identified as potential errors, and four appeared to be likely errors. Conclusions A claims-based algorithm combined with manual review of claims profiles could identify potential drug name confusion errors, and narrow down likely errors that warrant further investigation.

TI  - Terrestrial and Remote Indexes to Assess Moderate Deficit Irrigation in Early-Maturing Nectarine Trees
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring plant water status is relevant for the sustainable management of irrigation under water deficit conditions. Two treatments were applied to an early-maturing nectarine orchard: control (well irrigated) and precise deficit irrigation (PDI, based on soil water content thresholds). Moderate water deficits generated by PDI were assessed by comparing terrestrial: stem water potential (Psi(stem)) and gas exchange parameters, with remote: canopy temperature, normalized difference vegetation (NDVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), plant water status indicators. The Psi(stem) was the only indicator that showed significant differences between treatments. NDVI and SAVI at the postharvest period were appropriate indexes for estimating winter pruning, although they did not serve well as plant stress indicator. Vapor pressure deficit along with Psi(stem) values were able to predict remote sensing data. Psi(stem) and canopy to air temperature difference values registered the highest signal intensity and NDVI the highest sensitivity for detecting water deficit situations. The results suggest that care should be taken when using instantaneous remote indicators to evaluate moderate water deficits in deciduous fruit trees; more severe/longer water stress conditions are probably needed. The proposed PDI strategy promoted water saving while maintaining yield, and could be considered a promising tool for semi-arid agrosystems.

In adults, exposure to line particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic control.OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate the associations of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with HRV as an indicator of cardiac autonomic control during early development.METHODS: We studied 237 maternal-infant pairs in a Boston-based birth cohort. We estimated daily residential PM2.5 using satellite data in combination with land-use regression predictors. In infants at 6 months of age, we measured parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity using continuous electrocardiogram monitoring during the Repeated Still-Face Paradigm, an experimental protocol designed to elicit autonomic reactivity in response to maternal interaction and disengagement. We used multivariable linear regression to examine average PM2.5 exposure across pregnancy in relation to PNS withdrawal and activation, indexed by changes in respiration-corrected respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA(C))-an established metric of HRV that reflects cardiac vagal tone. We examined interactions with infant sex using cross-product terms.RESULTS: In adjusted models we found that a 1-unit increase in PM2.5 (in micrograms per cubic meter) was associated with a 3.53% decrease in baseline RSA, (95% CI: -6.96, 0.02). In models examining RSA, change between episodes, higher PM2.5 was generally associated with reduced PNS withdrawal during stress and reduced PNS activation during recovery; however, these associations were not statistically significant. We did not observe a significant interaction between PM2.5 and sex.DISCUSSION: Prenatal exposure to PM2.5 may disrupt cardiac vagal tone during infancy. Future research is needed to replicate these preliminary findings.

TI  - Generating intra-year metrics of wildfire progression using multiple open-access satellite data streams
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017 fire season was one of the largest on record for British Columbia (BC), Canada, in terms of total area burned (estimated 1.2 million ha), affecting the safety and air quality of numerous communities. Moreover, fires of this number and extent alter the wood supply for harvesting, the nature of habitat for wildlife, and can affect regional and national carbon budgets. As a result, it is important to map these fires accurately and to monitor within-year fire progression in order to quantify the resulting forest-disturbance impacts fully. The Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (BULC) algorithm was used to merge burned-area classifications of individual fires from a range of remote sensing sources such as Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS (MCD64A1) burned-area dataset. Together, these provisional classifications imaged each pixel within a known fire perimeter an average of 33.8 times between April 1 and December 1. The resulting 35-week time-series stack had updated weekly burned areas for each of the 89 fires in BC in 2017. Province-wide fire progression was variable throughout the period analyzed, characterized by a steady burn phase of 41,437 ha (5% of total area burned) over a two-week period in early July, an accelerated burn phase of 149,422 ha (17%) from mid-July to early August, another steady burn phase of 218,079 ha (24%) for one month until early September, and a second accelerated burn phase of 301,931 ha (34%) over two weeks in late September with subsequent steady growth of 180,119 ha (20%) over 1.5 months until containment in late October. Herein, we demonstrate how such temporally dense fire classification stacks can be used to analyze fire progression over the course of a fire season (both retrospectively and in near-real time) providing useful metrics to characterize and compare fire events. End-of-season burned-area estimates correspond with estimates derived from the National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) product that is generated retrospectively from fire best-available mapping approaches. This rapid interpretation of information enables the analysis of suppression success and potential drivers of fires spread while facilitating analyses of carbon budget consequences as well as impacts to communities and timber supply.

TI  - Measuring and categorizing the water-related downstream risks associated with mineral extraction in Honduras: How severe, and how distributed?
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictions about the spatial distribution of environmental impacts related to extractive industries have commonly assumed an inverse relationship between the severity of impact and distance from the site of extraction. However, because of the salience of water to both extractive industries and other livelihood strategies, many severe externalities of extractive development are experienced in areas hydrologically linked to the site of extraction, though these areas may not be those closest to mines themselves. This paper uses cadastral and remotely sensed data to model the spatial distribution of water, and extractive industries in Honduras and identify hydrological links between mines and downstream areas. Based on water availability, and the amount of upstream extractive development, it describes vulnerability to water-related risks from extractive industries in terms of severity as well as its concentration, measuring how local or spatially distributed are potential sources of impact. A consideration of risks experienced by agricultural producers indicates that small-scale farmers and large, commercial growers face distinctly different types of risk, and suggests that each group may pursue different strategies for mitigation. These strategies differ with respect to the spatial and administrative scales at which they would be pursued, as well as the degree to which they push for governance approaches focusing on spatially-defined, cadastral units of regulation or on broader regional and landscape impacts.

TI  - Estimating Forest Canopy Height Using MODIS BRDF Data Emphasizing Typical-Angle Reflectances
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest-canopy height is an important parameter for the estimation of forest biomass and terrestrial carbon flux and climate-change research at regional and global scales. Currently, various methods combining Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with various auxiliary data, particularly satellite remotely sensed reflectances, have been widely used to produce spatially continuous canopy-height products. However, current methods in use for remote sensing reflectances mainly focus on the nadir view direction, while anisotropic reflectances, which are theoretically more sensitive to the forest canopy height in the multiangle remote sensing field, have rarely been explored. Here, we attempted to examine the potential of using modeled multiangle reflectances at three typical viewing angles (i.e., from the hotspot, darkspot, and nadir directions) to estimate forest-canopy height as auxiliary data sources. First, the sensitivities of the typical angular reflectances as a function of forest canopy height were fully examined using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) method based on the 4-scale Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model simulations. This indicated that reflectances in the off-nadir viewing directions are generally sensitive to canopy-height variations. Then, the canopy heights were extracted from airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data, which were further divided into training and validation data. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multiangle reflectances at typical viewing angles were calculated from the MODIS BRDF parameter product (MCD43A1, version 6) as partial training-input data, based on a hotspot-adjusted, kernel-driven linear BRDF model. Subsequently, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning model was trained to acquire the relationship between the extracted canopy heights and the corresponding MODIS typical viewing reflectances. The trained model was further applied to estimate the canopy height metrics in the study areas of Howland Forest, Harvard Forest, and Bartlett Forest. Finally, the estimated canopy heights were independently validated by canopy heights extracted from the LVIS data. The results indicate that the canopy heights modeled through this method exhibit generally high accordance with the LVIS-derived canopy heights (R = 0.65-0.67; RMSE = 3.63-5.78). The results suggest that the MODIS multiangle reflectance data at typical observation angles contain important information regarding forest canopy height and can, therefore, be used to estimate forest canopy height for various ecological applications.

TI  - Identifying Biases in Global Tree Cover Products: A Case Study in Costa Rica
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global tree cover products are widely used in analyses of deforestation, fragmentation, and connectivity, but are rarely critically assessed. Inaccuracies in these products could have consequences for future decision making, especially in data-poor regions like the tropics. In this study, potential biases in global and regional tree cover products were assessed across a diverse tropical country, Costa Rica. Two global tree cover products and one regional national forest cover map were evaluated along biophysical gradients in elevation, precipitation, and agricultural land cover. To quantify product accuracy and bias, freely available high-resolution imagery was used to validate tree and land cover across these gradients. Although the regional forest cover map was comparable in accuracy to a widely-used global forest map (the Global Forest Change of Hansen et al., also known as the GFC), another global forest map (derived from a cropland dataset) had the highest accuracy. Both global and regional forest cover products showed small to severe biases along biophysical gradients. Unlike the regional map, the global GFC map strongly underestimated tree cover (>10% difference) below 189 mm of precipitation and at elevations above 2000 m, with a larger bias for precipitation. All map products misclassified agricultural fields as forest, but the GFC product particularly misclassified row crops and perennial erect crops (banana, oil palm, and coffee), with maximum tree cover in agricultural fields of 89%-100% across all crops. Our analysis calls into further question the utility of the GFC product for global forest monitoring outside humid regions, indicating that, in tropical regions, the GFC product is most accurate in areas with high, aseasonal rainfall, low relief, and low cropland area. Given that forest product errors are spatially distributed along biophysical gradients, researchers should account for these spatial biases when attempting to analyze or generate forest map products.

T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) currently represents up to 15% of the newly diagnosed breast cancers, and are almost always detected by microcalcifications.Global prognosis is good (3% of 15-year specific mortality) but invasive local recurrences (LR) can lead to metastasis in 12-15% of the cases.Breast conserving surgery with whole breast irradiation is the main treatment (reducing LR by 50%), but mastectomy (with or without reconstruction) is performed in about 30% of the cases due to wide lesion size and/or multicentricity. The role of tamoxifen remains unclear.Axillary dissection is needless but sentinel node biopsy is proposed in case of micro-invasion suspicion (large lesions with high grade). The main factors of LR are young age (<= 40 years) incomplete excision, and high nuclear grade with comedonecrosis.Several studies on "therapeutic descalation'' are still ongoing in order to identify the "low risk'' DCIS (about 10% of the cases) in which radiotherapy could be safely omitted.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inger Christensen's poem collection Det is one of the most recognizable and significant contemporary Danish works. Its complex and elaborate form and message have already been a subject of innumerous investigations and analyses, but neither of them has addressed its litanic traits. Basing on Witold Sadowski's methodological apparatus, we intend to demonstrate that Christensen's work can be perceived as litanic verse in terms of its form and generic worldview. As it appears from our investigation, in Det one litanic gene, the polyonymic, is most discernible, which translates into repetitive structures and enumerations, as well as the lyrical person's humbleness in face of the greatness of creation.

TI  - Application of machine learning to large hail prediction - The importance of radar reflectivity, lightning occurrence and convective parameters derived from ERA5
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a concept for coupling remote sensing data and environmental variables with machine learning techniques for the prediction of large hail events. In particular, we want to address the following question: How would one improve the performance of large hail warnings / forecasts if thermodynamic and kinematic parameters derived from a numerical weather prediction model are combined with real-time remote sensing data? For this purpose, POLRAD radar reflectivity, EUCLID lightning detection data, and convective indices calculated from the ERAS reanalysis are combined and then compared with large hail reports from Poland (2008-2017). The data fusion of multiple sources, coupled with the machine learning approach, makes it possible to greatly improve the robustness of large hail prediction compared to any single product commonly used in operational forecasting. This is especially noticeable with the reduced number of false alarms. Although the created machine learning models are mainly driven by radar reflectivity, composite thermodynamic and kinematic indices such as Hail Size Index (HSI), Significant Hail Parameter (SHIP), Large Hail Parameter (LGHAIL), and WMAXSHEAR provide an added value to a model's performance. The accuracy achieved by a random forest model brings with it encouraging prospects for future research with respect to operational forecasters (who may fill in the gaps within NWP-derived data with remotely sensed measurement) and climatological studies that aim to investigate past and future changes in severe weather occurrences.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil attributes using machine learning
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the chemical attributes of the soil on a large scale can result in gains when planning the use and occupation of the land. There are different techniques available for this purpose, whose performance should be tested for different types of landscapes. The aim of this study was to spatialize chemical attributes of the soil, comparing eight methods of prediction. Forty morphometric attributes, generated from a digital elevation model, were used as independent variables, in addition to geophysical data, images from the Landsat 8 satellite and the NDVI. All possible combinations between the satellite bands were calculated, generating 28 new variables. Combinations between the Th, U and K bands obtained from the geophysical data were also calculated, generating a further three variables. The final variables to be calculated were the distances between the four points of the edges of the basin (d1, d2, d3 and d4). The dependent variables for the model were Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, Ti, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, V, Zn, Zr, S and Cl. A total of 200 soil samples were used, which were collected from 100 points at two depths (0-10 and 10-30 cm); the total elements were determined using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The Random Forest algorithm proved to be superior to the others in predicting the chemical attributes of the soil at both depths, and is suitable for predicting soil attributes in the study region. Spatial variables are essential, and should be considered when modelling chemical elements in the soil. Using the methods under test, it is possible to predict elements with R-2 values ranging from 0.32 to 0.62.

AB  - Schistosomiasis is a neglected disease that affects millions of people around the world, being common in the state of Maranhao. A total of 225 rodents of the Holochilus sciureus species from the Western Lowland Maranhao were studied, of which 144 animals (64%) exhibited Schistosoma eggs in their feces samples. Macroscopic lesions characterized as well-defined whitish areas on the liver and spleen surfaces were observed. Histopathological examination revealed multifocal granulomas in the esophagus, liver, spleen, pancreas and duodenum, with structures compatible with Schistosoma mansoni eggs, as well as severe hepatic micro-vacuolar degeneration, multifocal and coalescent, with proliferation of random bile ducts and associated epithelial hyperplasia to areas of fibrosis. Adult forms of the parasite were observed in the blood vessels of the portal space. The lungs exhibited moderate and diffuse interstitial pneumonia with intralesional S. mansoni eggs. In the kidneys, hyaline cylinders were observed in the pelvis and diffuse hemorrhage. In conclusion, H. sciureus displays a pathological picture similar to human being. This rodent plays a role as sentinel in Baixada Maranhense.

TI  - Identification of critical location for enhancing groundwater recharge in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanization and construction of modern infrastructure lead to the increase in surface runoff and decrease in infiltration. Groundwater is one of the most important water sources in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The amount of groundwater extraction over the years has been greater than the natural replenishment capacity, as a result the water table has significantly decreased. This study mainly aims to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge. The land covers in 1996 and 2011 were generated based on Landsat satellite image with a 30x30m resolution. The 2030 land cover was modeled with a land change modeler, The Arc-Curve number tool was used to calculate the curve number (CN). Runoff was calculated with the SCS runoff equation. Compared to that in 1996, the forest and agriculture area in 2011 decreased, whereas the vegetation and builtup areas increased. From 2011 to 2030, no changes in forest, decrease in vegetation and agriculture area, and increase in the built-up area are observed. The water area throughout the study periods is less than 0.2%. The city center of Kathmandu Valley has higher CN, greater than 85, for all the observed periods, as a result, a higher runoff is observed. The weighted average CNs are 63 and 65 for 2011 and 2030, respectively. The northern and southern parts of Kathmandu Valley has lower CNs; hence, the lower runoff and possibly higher infiltration indicate critical locations for the groundwater recharge. The northern area includes, Lapsephedi, Gagalphedi, Nayapati, Sundarijal, Chapali, Bhadrakali, Budalinilkantha, and Baluwa and southern area includes Devichour, Nallu, Bhardv, and Godawari.

TI  - Spectral mixture analysis in Google Earth Engine to model and delineate fire scars over a large extent and a long time-series in a rainforest-savanna transition zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is used worldwide to clear natural vegetation areas for economic activities and to manage the regeneration of already opened sites. In Brazil, fire has been traditionally used to convert natural vegetation areas to agricultural lands (slash and burn) and to manage pastures for livestock. We developed the Burned Area Spectral Mixture Analysis (BASMA) algorithm in Google Earth Engine, which is designed to process Landsat data to produce a multi-temporal fire scar database representing annual burned area for an extent of 362,000 km(2) in the transition zone between the Amazon forest and the Cerrado biome. This region is considered a conservation hotspot, given its high deforestation rates over the last four decades. We digitally processed a 32-year time-series (1985 to 2017) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data to map fire scars based on sub-pixel char fraction, aiming to generate a consistent burned area product at a finer scale and covering a longer period than those currently available for the region. Manually interpreted reference burned area polygons for each annual mosaic was used to guide the definition of the best fire scar endmember and its fraction threshold. To assess our BASMA-delineated fire scar, they were compared to independent datasets of manually delineated burned area produced by visual analysis of finer spatial resolution imagery, returning an average Dice Coefficient value of 0.86. Accuracy was also measured against the 30-meter Burned Area product available at the 'Queimadas' data portal. A total of 11,106,258 ha was mapped as having been affected by fire during the annual dry season over the 32 years, which represents 30.7% of the study region. Results showed a decreasing trend in the annual amount of burned area over the time-series. It reflects a similar pattern shown in the deforestation rate for the Legal Amazon, measured by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research - INPE. Moreover, the Cerrado biome subset of the study region consistently showed higher burned area when compared to the Amazon forest subset. Our findings provide robust evidence that our approach is a consistent method to identify and delineate fire scars for large areas over a long time-series in a very efficient fashion, given the digital processing power of Google Earth Engine, which reduces the time necessary to analyze such big amount of data.

TI  - On Some aspects of the Image of Dzerassa in the Ossetian Nartiada
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the research is to determine the mythological content of the image of Dzerassa and try to identify its areal relations. The achievement of this aim involves an extensive use of comparative material from other folklore and mythological traditions in the Indo-European area and beyond. The source base of the research is the most authoritative scientific edition of the Ossetian Nart legends, as well as materials of Ossetian ethnography. Comparative material is represented by the data of the German-Scandinavian epos, fairy tale folklore of the peoples of Europe, and medieval chivalry novels. The study is based on a comparative methodology. The combination of a comparative mythological method and historical typological analysis allows a comparison of the Nart tales with texts belonging to other folk traditions in order to create a more complete picture of the Ossetians' traditional worldview. The study examined the motives of the tales of Dzerassa, which until now have not been developed to a sufficient degree. (1) The transformation of Dzerassa into a fox finds close matches in the folklore of Northern European peoples, especially of the Saami, which is probably due to the contacts between the Indo-Iranians and Finno-Ugric tribes. (2) Dzerassa's healing with a miraculous apple can be traced to the Ossetian funeral ritual, in which the apple was associated with a set of ideas about immortality. (3) The theme of the "symbol of purity" (an unsheathed sword) is similar to European epic tales and medieval chivalric novels. The context of the Dzerassa legend provides evidence in favor of the fact that this motif dates back to the ancient legal tradition. (4) Twins as a twofold character. In the legend of Dzerassa, the twins Akhsar and Akhsartag act as a single character. Dzerassa gets pregnant simultaneously from the two brothers and gives birth to twins, who are considered to be sons of both Akhsar and Akhsartag. These motives find typological conformity far beyond the existence of the Nart epic tales. There is no doubt that the legend of Dzerassa and the Nart twins is part of the archaic mythological legacy. The image of Dzerassa has distinctive traits of the ancient Mother Goddess, which can be seen in the motif of Dzerassa turning into a fox, as well as in that of Akhsar and Akhsartag acting as a dual character and as the progenitors of the main characters. The sword between Dzerassa and Akhsar/Ahsartag has numerous folklore and ethnographic analogies, but the question of its origin is still not resolved and requires a further study.

TI  - Exploring coarse- to fine-scale approaches for mapping and estimating forest volume from Brazilian National Forest Inventory data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore methods to: (1) enhance coarse-scale estimates of wood volume from National Forest Inventories (NFIs) data and (2) map them at finer scales. The 'standard' coarse-scale estimation extrapolates wood volume from clusters to the grid cell they represent, using the cluster's represented forested area (RFA) to predict the cell's forested area. Data from a subset of Brazil's NFI clusters were combined with Landsat-8 imagery to explore a new coarse-scale method, where forested area derived from image classification (FADIC) is used instead of RFA. The RFA- and FADIC-derived estimates of total volume were, respectively, 197.4 million m(3) and 116.3 million m(3). For fine-scale methods, volume was estimated and mapped at pixel level using: (i) surface reflectance-based models (SRMs), and (ii) regression-kriging (RK) and a RK model (RKM) whose inputs were latitude and longitude of pixels. The SRM-based method captured the mean and the general spatial trend of the volume well. The RK-based method also estimated the mean well, but it failed to predict higher and lower volumes. The SRM- and RK-based estimates of total volume were 211.7 million m(3) and 203.3 million m(3), an overestimate of 7 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, of the 'standard' NFI estimate (197.4 million m(3)), though both estimates were within the 95 per cent confidence interval, meaning that both fine-scale methods yield total volume statistically similar to the 'standard' coarse-scale method.

TI  - Neurotized Diagonal Profunda Artery Perforator Flaps for Breast Reconstruction
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap remains the gold standard for autologous breast reconstruction, many patients are not candidates for this surgery. A variety of thigh-based flaps have been used including the diagonal upper gracilis (DUG) flap, vertical upper gracilis flap, profunda artery perforator (PAP) flap, and lateral thigh perforator flap. However, each of these techniques has a unique set of benefits and drawbacks in terms of wound healing, donor site morbidity, and potential for lymphedema. We describe the first report of a sensate diagonal PAP flap for breast reconstruction: combining the benefits of the DUG (wider skin paddle and reliable wound healing) with the benefits of the PAP (muscle-sparing technique and greater distance from the lymphatic collectors). This was the authors' sentinel case in a woman with paraplegia and chronic leg swelling. Preoperative imaging, markings, and technical details are presented along with postoperative results. In the appropriately selected patient, this flap offers several advantages: a 2-team approach to reconstruction, ample tissue for breast reconstruction, potential neurotization for breast sensibility, wound closure in resting skin tension lines, and avoidance of the lymphatic drainage to the lower extremity. The diagonal PAP flap provides a muscle-sparing alternative to the DUG flap while minimizing the risk of lymphedema. Future studies are needed to assess the donor site morbidity of this flap; however, this case proves the safety and reliability of the diagonal PAP flap in our breast reconstruction population.

TI  - Combining LiDAR and hyperspectral data for aboveground biomass modeling in the Brazilian Amazon using different regression algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests are critical for supporting strategies of ecosystem functioning conservation and climate change mitigation. However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE % = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5-12) than LiDAR-only models (2-5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 31%, R-2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets. Results show that the synergistic use of LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential for improving the accuracy of the biomass estimates in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Analysis of Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Properties in the Northeast Brazilian Atmosphere with Remote Sensing Data from MODIS and CALIOP/CALIPSO Satellites, AERONET Photometers and a Ground-Based Lidar
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A 12-year analysis, from 2005 to 2016, of atmospheric aerosol optical properties focusing for the first time on Northeast Brazil (NEB) was performed based on four different remote sensing datasets: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), the Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and a ground-based Lidar from Natal. We evaluated and identified distinct aerosol types, considering Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE). All analyses show that over the NEB, a low aerosol scenario prevails, while there are two distinct seasons of more elevated AOD that occur every year, from August to October and January to March. According to MODIS, AOD values ranges from 0.04 to 0.52 over the region with a mean of 0.20 and occasionally isolated outliers of up to 1.21. Aerosol types were identified as sea spray, biomass burning, and dust aerosols mostly transported from tropical Africa. Three case studies on days with elevated AOD were performed. All cases identified the same aerosol types and modeled HYSPLIT backward trajectories confirmed their source-dependent origins. This analysis is motivated by the implementation of an atmospheric chemistry model with an advanced data assimilation system that will use the observational database over NEB with the model to overcome high uncertainties in the model results induced by still unvalidated emission inventories.

TI  - Exploring improvements to the design of an operational seasonal forage scarcity index from NDVI time series for livestock insurance in East Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrent drought represents a major threat in arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa where pastoralists depend on their livestock for subsistence. In Kenya and southern Ethiopia, an existing satellite-based index insurance scheme aims to protect pastoralists against the adverse effects of drought. Under that scheme, payouts are made based on an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI values are directly averaged per unit areas of insurance (UAI), which are based on administrative borders but take into limited account the ecological variability within the unit. The choice of administrative boundaries at the onset of the analysis may negatively impact the performance of the product. Our study explores an alternative index design based on an ecological stratification of the study area. First, we performed an unsupervised classification of NDVI time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to group pixels with similar temporal NDVI trajectories. Next, we used average NDVI profiles and ancillary data to discard areas deemed insignificant for forage production. We then transformed NDVI values into z-scores to assess how each pixel relates to the multi-year distribution of NDVI values per class and season. In the final step, we calculated the alternative forage scarcity index, which is the percentage of pixels with anomalously low NDVI values per season and UAI (i.e. z-score <= -1.0). To evaluate its performance, we compared unit-level results for both the original and alternative designs against spatially-aggregated monthly household survey data on livestock mortality from 16 sample sites corresponding to eight administrative units within the study area. Besides performing better in predicting livestock mortality (i.e. increases of 53% and 39% in correlation coefficients as measured by Pearson's r and Spearman's rho, respectively) and strengthening the ecological significance of the index, the proposed design has a number of other advantages: 1) the index is calculated using a much larger statistical basis, 2) it allows for analysis of forage conditions at subunit level, and 3) it offers a more flexible structure for payout calculation. These advantages could be of particular relevance for expanding the index-insurance scheme to agro-pastoral regions characterized by more heterogeneous landscapes. Finally, we propose to consider using this approach to better account for the ecological variability of rangelands in other NDVI-based early warning and monitoring systems.

TI  - Playing the Other: Role-playing religion in videogames
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In contemporary 'post-secular society', videogames like Assassin's Creed, BioShock Infinite or World of Warcraft are suffused with religious elements. Departing from a critique on studies perceiving such in-game representations as discriminatory forms of religious Othering, the main research question of this article is: how does role-playing the (non-)religious Other in games affect the worldview of players? The study is based on a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews held with 20 international players from different (non-)religious backgrounds. Rather than seeing religion in games as representations of 'Othering', the analysis demonstrates that players from different (non-)religious beliefs take on different worldviews while role-playing the (non-)religious Other. Atheists relativize their own position, opening up to the logic of religious worldviews; Christians, Hindus and Muslims, in turn, compare traditions and may draw conclusions about the similarities underlying different world religions. Other players 'slip into a secular mindset', gradually turning towards the position of a 'religious none'. It is concluded that playing the religious Other in videogames provides the opportunity to suspend (non-)religious worldviews and empathize with the (non-)religious Other. The relevance of these findings is related to broader sociological debates about 'post-secular society' and the alleged increase of religious fundamentalism, conflict and mutual Othering.

AB  - Lymph node macroscopic involvement in cervical cancer is a well-known prognostic factor, allows the gynecologic-oncologist to identify women at increased risk for recurrence. Since the development of sentinel node biopsy, micrometastases (MMs) and Isolated Tumor Cells (ICTs) have been increasingly identified in cervical cancer, however their prognostic value and treatment are still controversial. We reviewed the literature (MEDLINE and EMBASE database analysis) from inception up to January 2019, concerning the incidence of lymph nodes MMs and ITCs in cervical cancer, their controversial histologic and molecular biology definition, their anatomic distribution, the role of frozen section and the prognostic value and treatment options for women diagnosed with lymph nodes MMs/ITCs.

TI  - Additional Value of Using Satellite-Based Soil Moisture and Two Sources of Groundwater Data for Hydrological Model Calibration
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the complexity of physically-based models continues to increase, they still need to be calibrated. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using new satellite technologies and products with high resolution in model evaluations and decision-making. The aim of this study is to investigate the value of different remote sensing products and groundwater level measurements in the temporal calibration of a well-known hydrologic model i.e., Hydrologiska Bryans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV). This has rarely been done for conceptual models, as satellite data are often used in the spatial calibration of the distributed models. Three different soil moisture products from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Measure (ESA CCI SM v04.4), The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite (AMSR-E), soil moisture active passive (SMAP), and total water storage anomalies from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) are collected and spatially averaged over the Moselle River Basin in Germany and France. Different combinations of objective functions and search algorithms, all targeting a good fit between observed and simulated streamflow, groundwater and soil moisture, are used to analyze the contribution of each individual source of information. Firstly, the most important parameters are selected using sensitivity analysis, and then these parameters are included in a subsequent model calibration. The results of our multi-objective calibration reveal a substantial contribution of remote sensing products to the lumped model calibration, even if their spatially-distributed information is lost during the spatial aggregation. Inclusion of new observations, such as groundwater levels from wells and remotely sensed soil moisture to the calibration improves the model's physical behavior, while it keeps a reasonable water balance that is the key objective of every hydrologic model.

TI  - Geospatial Big Data: New Paradigm of Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of information technology and location techniques not only leads to an increasing growth of massive geospatial big data but also raises the attention of using these data to complement with remote sensing images. Many efforts have been made to utilize geospatial big data to identify human activity patterns and carry out urban and environmental researches, integrating with remote sensing images. Nonetheless, there are still many issues, including the representativeness and locality of geospatial big data, as well as the fusion methods, remain to be further explored. In this article, we first reviewed the innovation and proceedings of data mining and analyzing techniques, as well as remote sensing applications driven by geospatial big data. Besides, two popular concepts, namely, "Social Sensing" and "Urban Computing," were briefly introduced. Then, we highlighted the role of geospatial big data in mining human activity dynamics and socioeconomic characteristics, and the feasibility of combining with remote sensing data for various studies. Lastly, we presented some empirical case studies on the confluence of remote sensing and geospatial big data in land use extraction, environmental and disaster monitoring, as well as socioeconomic dynamics sensing. The provided examples and discussion demonstrated the high efficiency and complementarity of the integration of remote sensing and geospatial big data, which benefits decision making from multiple perspectives and scales.

TI  - Long-Term Changes of Open-Surface Water Bodies in the Yangtze River Basin Based on the Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal changes of open-surface water bodies in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) have profound influences on sustainable economic development, and are also closely relevant to water scarcity in China. However, long-term changes of open-surface water bodies in the YRB have remained poorly characterized. Taking advantage of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, this study processed 75,593 scenes of Landsat images to investigate the long-term changes of open-surface water bodies in the YRB from 1984 to 2018. In this study, we adopted the percentile-based image composite method to collect training samples and proposed a multiple index water detection rule (MIWDR) to quickly extract the open-surface water bodies. The results indicated that (1) the MIWDR is suitable for the long-term and large-scale Landsat water bodies mapping, especially in the urban regions. (2) The areas of permanent water bodies and seasonal water bodies were 29,076.70 km(2) and 21,526.24 km(2), accounting for 57.46% and 42.54% of the total open-surface water bodies in the YRB, respectively. (3) The permanent water bodies in the YRB increased along with the decreases in the seasonal water bodies from 1984 to 2018. In general, the total open-surface surface water bodies in the YRB experienced an increasing trend, with an obvious spatial heterogeneity. (4) The changes of open-surface water bodies were associated with the climate changes and intense human activities in the YRB, however, the influences varied among different regions and need to be further investigated in the future.

TI  - Effect of friction pendulum bearing properties on behaviour of buildings subjected to seismic loads
T2  - SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the influence of the friction pendulum bearing (FPB) isolator characteristics on the nonlinear response of the buildings under various seismic excitations. To represent a wide range of assessment, 3, 6, and 9-storey steel framed buildings with twenty seven different isolation models of FPB were studied by identifying the local and global deformations. Three important parameters such as isolation period T (as 2, 2.5, and 3s), effective damping ratio beta (as 0.05, 0.15, 0.25), and yield strength ratio Fy/W (as 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10) were used in the modelling of FPB. Two-dimensional model of the base-isolated steel frames were created and the nonlinear time history analysis was performed through a number of earthquake ground motions. The behaviour of the isolated frames was measured by the variation of isolator displacement, roof drift ratio, relative displacement, interstorey drift ratio, absolute acceleration, base shear, base moment, hysteretic curve, and dissipated energy. The benefits obtained through the adoption of the base isolation system were discussed. It was found that the seismic response of the base-isolated frames could be estimated accurately by adjusting the proper isolation period, yield strength ratio, and effective damping ratio for the case studied structures.

TI  - Pervasive Resistance to Pyrethroids in German Cockroaches (Blattodea: Ectobiidae) Related to Lack of Efficacy of Total Release Foggers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite limited efficacy data, do-it-yourself (DIY) insecticide products often promise low-cost alternatives to professional pest control. Total release foggers (TRFs, 'bug bombs'), which are prominent DIY products, were recently shown to be ineffective at reducing German cockroach (Blattella germanica L.) infestations, in contrast to highly effective baits. However, the reason(s) for TRF failure remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated insecticide resistance of apartment-collected cockroaches from homes where TRFs failed. In topical (direct) application assays, resistance to cypermethrin (a common active ingredient in TRFs) was 202 +/- 33 times that of a laboratory insecticide-susceptible population (based on LD50 ratios), while resistance to fipronil, a common bait active ingredient, was considerably lower at 14 +/- 2 times that of the laboratory insecticide-susceptible population. The addition of PBO, a P450 inhibitor that synergizes pyrethroids, enhanced the efficacy of cypermethrin, but only at high doses of cypermethrin. Additionally, >96% of screened cockroaches possessed at least one copy of the L993F mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel, known to confer resistance to pyrethroids (knockdown resistance, kdr). Because TRF treatments killed insecticide-susceptible sentinel cockroaches but failed to kill apartment-collected cockroaches, these results suggest that pyrethroid resistance is a major factor contributing to the failure of TRFs. Multiple mechanisms of resistance, including metabolic detoxification of the pyrethroids and kdr mutations that confer target-site insensitivity, suggest that TRFs would lack efficacy against German cockroaches in residential settings, where high levels of pyrethroid resistance have been documented globally.

TI  - Clinical management of early-stage cervical cancer: The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in tumors ≤2 cm
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the experience with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer at our hospital, and to analyze factors influencing the rate of false negatives.Study design: This study was carried out at the Vail d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) between September 2000 and October 2016. All patients underwent SLN biopsy and systematic and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, followed by radical hysterectomy. SLNs were analyzed by the pathologist by staining with hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry.Results: Patients (N =128) had been diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO-2009 stages IA2, IB1, and IIA1). The combined SLN detection rate (99-technetium and a blue dye) was 98.4%, bilateral in 76% of the patients. Positive SLN5 were found in 19 patients (14.8%). Sensitivity of detection was 79.2% (CI95, 57.9-92.9), false negative rate 20.8% (CI95, 7.1-42.2), and negative predictive value 95.4% (CI95, 89.6-98.5). False negative cases were observed in 5 patients with tumors >2 cm and presenting lymphovascular space invasion. Micrometastases were detected during SLN ultrastaging in 3 patients (2.3%). The median follow-up was 8.24 years and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 88.4% (CI95, 80.993.1).Conclusion: SLN mapping and biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer is feasible and has high sensitivity to detect patients with initial metastases. The risk of false negatives could be lower in certain groups of patients, such as those with tumors <= 2 cm and no lymphovascular space invasion, but future studies will be required to test this hypothesis.

TI  - A Hybrid Computational Intelligence Approach to Groundwater Spring Potential Mapping
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a hybrid computational intelligence model that is a combination of alternating decision tree (ADTree) classifier and AdaBoost (AB) ensemble, namely "AB-ADTree", for groundwater spring potential mapping (GSPM) at the Chilgazi watershed in the Kurdistan province, Iran. Although ADTree and its ensembles have been widely used for environmental and ecological modeling, they have rarely been applied to GSPM. To that end, a groundwater spring inventory map and thirteen conditioning factors tested by the chi-square attribute evaluation (CSAE) technique were used to generate training and testing datasets for constructing and validating the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using statistical-index-based measures, such as positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC). The proposed hybrid model was also compared with five state-of-the-art benchmark soft computing models, including single ADTree, support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), logistic model tree (LMT), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF). Results indicate that the proposed hybrid model significantly improved the predictive capability of the ADTree-based classifier (AUROC = 0.789). In addition, it was found that the hybrid model, AB-ADTree, (AUROC = 0.815), had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the LMT (AUROC = 0.803), RF (AUC = 0.803), SGD, and SVM (AUROC = 0.790) models. Indeed, this model is a powerful and robust technique for mapping of groundwater spring potential in the study area. Therefore, the proposed model is a promising tool to help planners, decision makers, managers, and governments in the management and planning of groundwater resources.

TI  - Estimation of biophysical and biochemical variables of winter wheat through Sentinel-2 vegetation indices
T2  - BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, the growth and physiological status of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is monitored in the field by measuring different biophysical and biochemical variables such as Above Ground Biomass (AGB), Nitrogen content (N), N uptake, Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of vegetation Cover (fCover), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), and fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR). The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of estimating these crop variables through statistical regression modelling and spectral vegetation indices derived by the Sentinel-2 satellites. Field data were collected over two growing seasons, 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, in test fields around Knezha, northern Bulgaria. A combination of spectral data from Sentinel-2 images and field spectroscopy obtained through the first growing season was used for model calibration and cross-validation. The models were further validated with Sentinel-2 image data from the second growing season. The accuracy of the models varied widely across crop variables. According to the cross-validation, the relative RMSE was below 25% for fAPAR, fCover, and fresh AGB, with particularly good result for fAPAR (13%). For N content and dry AGB the error was between 25% and 30%. The accuracy was low for CCC, LAI, and N uptake (error between 30% and 43%). The models' performance was worse when they were applied to the data from the second growing season, resulting in relative RMSE which were 3-8% higher in the general case. The cross-validation results suggested that the variety-specific models are more accurate than the generally calibrated models for most crop variables. The accuracy obtained in this study for the prediction of fAPAR, fCover and AGBf through VIs is promising. Future studies and incorporation of new field data will be needed to better account for variety, season, and site variations in the modelled relationships and to improve their generalisation potential.

TI  - Management Strategies for the Conservation, Restoration and Utilization of Mangroves in Southeastern Mexico
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests in Tabasco, Mexico, require the conservation, utilization and rehabilitation of degraded areas. To determine their use potential, a regionalization was performed on the basis of edaphic conditions, geographic distribution, land use, natural protected areas and forest utilization. Additionally, the zoning of soils was performed by means of photointerpretation of geoforms in 1:20000 orthophoto maps for the location and analysis of 16 soil profiles and the analysis of hydrocarbon contamination in 20 sites. Furthermore, a dasometric inventory of 30 transects was performed. The mangrove area was determined with a supervised classification of 2009 SPOT 5 satellite images. Mangroves occupied 41,498.5 ha of Solonchak and Histosol soils. Mangroves contained up to 1184 trees ha(-1) and had a maximum average height of 19 m. Regionalization determined that 55.0% of mangroves require protection, 5.8% correspond to an area polluted by heavy hydrocarbons and require restoration, and 39.2% require utilization by inhabitants.

TI  - Assessment of the Hotspot Effect for the PROSAIL Model With POLDER Hotspot Observations Based on the Hotspot-Enhanced Kernel-Driven BRDF Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hotspot effect is a typical angular reflectance signature of vegetation canopies and contains important information for the retrieval of vegetation structural parameters. To date, the hotspot effect of various analytical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models (e.g., the PROSAIL model) has rarely been assessed by multiangular measurements with sufficient hotspot observations due to the lack of accurate hotspot measurements (for field measurements) or appropriate methods (for airborne and spaceborne measurements). In this paper, we develop a method to further improve the hotspot effect of the kernel-driven model and design a framework to utilize the improved kernel-driven model as a bridge to assess the hotspot effect of the PROSAIL model with Polarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectance (POLDER) hotspot observations. The results indicate that the proposed method further improves the fits between the models and the observations in the vicinity of the hotspot direction, particularly in the rare situations where the geometric-optical scattering component governs the target reflectance. In addition, the hotspot signature indicated by the PROSAIL multiangular data shows a larger variability than that of POLDER observations. C-1 and C-2 in the improved kernel-driven model can be used as benchmarked parameters to qualify the amplitude and width of the hotspot effect for the simulated multiangular data of physical BRDF models and thus present the potential for the assessment and analysis of the hotspot effect of physical models, which, in return, helps retrieve the structural parameters of vegetation canopies from hotspot signatures.

TI  - Disordered conversion of vegetation committees connectivity between forest fragments in the Brazilian Legal Amazon
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - y Accelerated and disordered conversion of forests into the agricultural frontier areas of the Brazilian Legal Amazon in the last four decades resulted in a fragmented landscape. Connectivity and maintenance of biodiversity in the remaining forest fragments are compromised. In this work, we evaluated landscape connectivity between the municipalities of Sorriso with a predominantly developed agricultural sector and the municipality of Alta Floresta with well-developed livestock farming. Both municipalities are located in the northern region of Mato Grosso state. We used scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite OLI (Operational Land Imager) of the year 2017 to quantify the amount of forest fragments. Six forest distances were stipulated in five size classes. Connectivity metrics of the forest fragments and landscape structure were calculated. The study area comprised 8,964 forest fragments, of which 6,149 fragments were devoted to livestock and 2,815 - to agriculture. The study results indicate that connectivity is based on long distances, which are unfavorable to mobility of the organisms. The best obtained connectivity values were 10,000m in the areas of agriculture and 5,000m for the livestock, respectively. The best areas for agricultural connectivity were represented by large, practically isolated fragments. In livestock areas, large fragments also had the highest connectivity values. However, smaller fragments in these areas also contributed to increased connectivity, unlike smaller fragments in agricultural areas. This research evidences the need to include environmental planning, that takes into account the forest remnants connectivity, in light of future legalized deforestation and as a way of maintaining biodiversity.

TI  - Probing the origin of stellar flares on M dwarfs using TESS data sectors 1-3
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed studies of the Sun have shown that sunspots and solar flares are closely correlated. Photometric data from Kepler/K2 has allowed similar studies to be carried out on other stars. Here, we utilize Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometric 2-min cadence of 167 low-mass stars from Sectors 1 to 3 to investigate the relationship between star-spots and stellar flares. From our sample, 90 per cent show clear rotational modulation likely due to the presence of a large, dominant star-spot and we use this to determine a rotational period for each star. Additionally, each low-mass star shows one or more flares in its light curve and using Gaia Data Release 2 parallaxes and SkyMapper magnitudes we can estimate the energy of the flares in the TESS band-pass. Overall, we have 1834 flares from the 167 low-mass stars with energies from 6.0 x 10(29) to 2.4 x 10(35) erg. We find none of the stars in our sample show any preference for rotational phase, suggesting the lack of a correlation between the large, dominant star-spot, and flare number. We discuss this finding in greater detail and present further scenarios to account for the origin of flares on these low-mass stars.

TI  - NDVI-based estimates of evapotranspiration of winter wheat indicate positive effects of N fertilizer application on agronomic water-use efficiency
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield increases by fertilizer application impose higher crop water use, as biomass production is positively correlated with transpiration. To quantify effects of N fertilizer supply on evapotranspiration (ET) of winter wheat, a field experiment with three nitrogen rates (N0, N120 and N230) under non-water-limited conditions was performed during 2014 and 2015. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to derive crop coefficients which were used to calculate N effects on bare soil evaporation (E), transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET), grain yield and harvest index (HI). E during the early post-winter growth period was measured with micro-lysimeters and compared with model estimates. N fertilizer supply resulted in lower cumulative E, and increases in grain yield were higher than increases in ET, resulting in a higher agronomic water-use efficiency (WUEY). HI of treatment N120 was higher than that of treatment N230 indicating that HI was not the main reason of higher WUEY of treatment N230. It is concluded that estimates of ET under variable N supply require consideration of N-induced effects on canopy development which could be successfully monitored by NDVI measurements. N supply increases ET and WUEY potentially imposing a trade-off between water conservation and efficiency of water use for crop production.

TI  - Troposphere delay modeling with horizontal gradients for satellite laser ranging
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite laser ranging (SLR) constitutes a fundamental space geodetic technique providing global geodetic parameters, such as geocenter coordinates, Earth rotation parameters, and low-degree gravity field coefficients. The tropospheric delay correction is one of the crucial corrections that have to be taken into account when processing SLR data. Current conventional models of the troposphere delays assume a full symmetry of the atmosphere above SLR stations. Neglecting horizontal gradients in SLR solutions introduces a systematic error in SLR products, especially for the observations at low elevation angles, and leads to a deterioration of the consistency between SLR and other space geodetic techniques, such as global navigational satellite systems and very-long-baseline interferometry. We derive new mapping function coefficients, as well as first- and second-order horizontal gradients, all of which are based on numerical weather models, in order to properly consider the azimuthal asymmetry in SLR solutions. We test the enhanced mapping function and horizontal gradients on the solutions based on 11 years of SLR observations to LAGEOS-1/2 satellites and 1 year of SLR observations to Sentinel-3A. The consideration of azimuthal asymmetry of the atmosphere above the SLR stations has a systematic effect on SLR-derived products, such as station and geocenter coordinates and pole coordinates. Horizontal gradients in SLR solutions improve the consistency between SLR-derived pole coordinates and the combined IERS-C04 series by means of reducing the offset for the X and Y pole coordinates by 20 mu as\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\upmu }\mathrm{as}$$\end{document}. The second-order horizontal gradients are negligible in SLR solutions; thus, including first-order gradients is sufficient for SLR solutions.

TI  - Sex ratios of migrating southern hemisphere humpback whales: A new sentinel parameter of ecosystem health
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern hemisphere humpback whales have evolved energetically demanding capital breeding and migratory life-history behaviours. It has been hypothesised that not all individuals of a population participate in the seasonal migration each year, or only undertake partial migrations. Given the cost of migration and reproduction, we explored the possibility that specifically, not all mature females participate in the seasonal migration every year, or significantly delay or shorten their migration, in response to poor feeding conditions. That is, females must attain a minimum threshold of accumulated energy reserves to commit to a reproductive event that likely occurs as a product of mating during migration. With a 1:1 male to female birth ratio, yet a male bias observed along the main migratory corridor; this study utilised inter-annual migratory cohort sex ratios to explore their potential to serve as measures of population fecundity, as a function of ecosystem health. The sex ratios of randomly biopsied adult humpback whales, sampled at a defined location and set time-points along the main migratory corridor from 2008 to 2016 were investigated. Northward migration sex ratios in 2009, 2014 and 2016 revealed a lower male bias suggesting good female participation in the migration and therefore apparent optimal provisioning during the two preceding summers. By contrast, the 2011 southward migration, revealed the highest male bias recorded of 5.75:1. Southward migration sex ratios were found to oscillate closely with measures of population adiposity, a sentinel parameter employed for long-term surveillance of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystems under the Southern Ocean Observing System-endorsed Humpback Whale Sentinel Program. Anomalously poor humpback whale body condition recorded in 2011 was attributed to poor Antarctic feeding conditions during the extreme La Nina event of 2010/11. These findings lend support for the application of migratory cohort sex ratios, standardised by time and location, as a measure of relative inter-annual population fecundity. This work therefore contributes a new non-lethal tool for the study of population health, as a function of ecosystem productivity, and facilitates the inclusion of fecundity as a sentinel parameter into long-term Antarctic ecosystem surveillance under the Humpback Whale Sentinel Program.

TI  - Impact of the Zhalong Wetland on Neighboring Land Surface Temperature Based on Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a key role in regulating local climate as well as reducing impacts caused by climate change. Rapid observations of the land surface temperature (LST) are, therefore, valuable for studying the dynamics of wetland systems. With the development of thermal remote sensing technology, LST retrieval with satellite images is a practicable way to detect a wetland and its neighboring area's thermal environment from a non-point visual angle rather than the traditional detection from a point visual angle. The mono-windows (MW) method of retrieving LST was validated. On the basis of estimated LST, we used Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to study the impact of wetland reclamation on local temperatures at a regional scale. Following that, correlations between LST and the wetland were analyzed. The results show that: 1) It is feasible to retrieve the LST from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images with MW model. The model was validated with the land surface temperature observed in four meteorological stations when the satellite scanned the study region. The satellite retrieval error was approximately 1.01 degrees C. 2) The relationship between the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures and the Zhalong wetland was analyzed based on GIS technology. The results show that wetland has an obvious influence on LST, and that this influence decreases with increasing distance from the wetland. When the distance from the wetland was less than 500 m, its influence on LST was significant. Results also illustrated that the effect of the wetland's different land use/land cover's LST distribution varied with different seasons.

TI  - Among multimodal imaging techniques, which can be trusted to assess radiologic N0 stage in patients with breast cancer?
T2  - IMAGERIE DE LA FEMME
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node involvement in breast cancer is a major prognostic factor. Even if different methods for sentinel lymph node biopsy exist, this technique is now widely practiced and accepted as standard of care worldwide. But those techniques have a rate of 10 to 15% of false negative, including macrometastatic nodes. Clinical evaluation being limited, multimodality imaging is commonly used to predict lymph node involvement in patient with breast cancer. Ultrasound is the first-line exam and has to be bilateral and must explore axillary, internal mammary, retropectoral and over-clavicular nodes. According to the morphologic evaluation of lymph nodes using ultrasound, axillary lymph nodes can be divided in three groups: normal, uncertain and suspicious. Fine-needle aspiration or core-needle biopsy are the two techniques used to have a sample of lymph nodes, and must be performed in patients with uncertain or suspicious lymph nodes. MRI, CT and PET-CT can be used to assess the extent of node involvement, mostly in patient with proven malignant lymph nodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the accuracy of surface soil moisture estimation from the C- and L-bands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) estimation is of great importance in several areas, such as hydrology, agriculture and risk assessment. C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data have been widely used to estimate SSM, whereas few studies have been performed using L-band SAR due to the low availability of L-band SAR data. In this context, the objective of the present paper is to compare the SSM estimation potentials of the C- (Sentinel-1) and L-bands (PALSAR) for wheat and grassland plots. The inversion approach developed in this study uses neural networks to invert the SAR signal and estimate the SSM. For each radar frequency, the developed neural networks were trained using the following as an input vector: SAR incidence angle, SAR polarization (VV for the C-band and HH for the L-band), and NDVI from optical images. Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) were developed and validated using synthetic and real databases. The results showed that the L-band provided slightly less accurate SSM estimates than the C-band. Moreover, the results showed that the accuracies of the SSM estimates for both frequencies strongly depended on the soil roughness (Hrms) and SSM values. From the synthetic database at SSM values less than 25 vol.%, the ANNs underestimated the SSM for Hrms values less than 1.5 cm and overestimated the SSM for Hrms values greater than 1.5 cm. In addition, the ANNs underestimated the SSM value regardless of the Hrms value when the SSM value was greater than 25 vol.%. An RMSE analysis of the SSM estimates showed that the highest RMSE values were observed for the L-band regardless of the SSM value, and high RMSE values were observed for the C-band only in very wet soil conditions (SSM > 25 vol.%). From the real database at NDVI values less than 0.7, the RMSE (root mean square error) of the SSM estimates was 4.6 vol.% for the C-band and 5.3 vol.% for the L-band. Most importantly, the L-band enabled the estimation of the SSM under a well-developed vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7) with an RMSE of 6.7 vol.%, whereas the C-band SAR signal became completely attenuated for some crops when the NDVI value was greater than 0.7, and thus the estimation of SSM was impossible using the C-band.

TI  - An Assessment of the Accuracy of MODIS Land Surface Temperature over Egypt Using Ground-Based Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based data have provided important advances in understanding climate systems and processes in arid and semi-arid regions, which are hot-spot regions in terms of climate change and variability. This study assessed the performance of land surface temperatures (LSTs), retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, over Egypt. Eight-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST data were aggregated and validated against near-surface seasonal and annual observational maximum and minimum air temperatures using data from 34 meteorological stations spanning the period from July 2002 to June 2015. A variety of accuracy metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of LST, including the bias, normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE), Yule-Kendall (YK) skewness measure, and Spearman's rho coefficient. The ability of LST to reproduce the seasonal cycle, anomalies, temporal variability, and the distribution of warm and cold tails of observational temperatures was also evaluated. Overall, the results indicate better performance of the nighttime LSTs compared to the daytime LSTs. Specifically, while nighttime LST tended to underestimate the minimum air temperature during winter, spring, and autumn on the order of -1.3, -1.2, and -1.4 degrees C, respectively, daytime LST markedly overestimated the maximum air temperature in all seasons, with values mostly above 5 degrees C. Importantly, the results indicate that the performance of LST over Egypt varies considerably as a function of season, lithology, and land use. LST performs better during transitional seasons (i.e., spring and autumn) compared to solstices (i.e., winter and summer). The varying interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially the differences between sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute largely to these seasonal variations. Spatially, LST performs better in areas with sandstone formations and quaternary sediments and, conversely, shows lower accuracy in regions with limestone, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. This behavior can be expected in hybrid arid and semi-arid regions like Egypt, where bare rocks contribute to the majority of the Egyptian territory, with a lack of vegetation cover. The low surface albedo of igneous and limestone rocks may explain the remarkable overestimation of daytime temperature in these regions, compared to the bright formations of higher surface albedo (i.e., sandy deserts and quaternary rocks). Overall, recalling the limited coverage of meteorological stations in Egypt, this study demonstrates that LST obtained from the MODIS product can be trustworthily employed as a surrogate for or a supplementary source to near-surface measurements, particularly for minimum air temperature. On the other hand, some bias correction techniques should be applied to daytime LSTs. In general, the fine space-based climatic information provided by MODIS LST can be used for a detailed spatial assessment of climate variability in Egypt, with important applications in several disciplines such as water resource management, hydrological modeling, agricultural management and planning, urban climate, biodiversity, and energy consumption, amongst others. Also, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the applications of remote sensing technology in assessing climatic feedbacks and interactions in arid and semi-arid regions, opening new avenues for developing innovative algorithms and applications specifically addressing issues related to these regions.

TI  - Ensemble-Based Systems to Monitor Algal Bloom With Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an ensemble-based system (EBS) for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) in inland water bodies using downscaled MODIS images was developed. Seeking additional opinions before making a decision is part of human nature, particularly for decisions involving health issues. The general concept behind EBS algorithms is based on this principle. Forty-six Chl-a measurements, collected over four water bodies between 2000 and 2008, were used to calibrate the EBS. Measurements ranged from 2.7 (oligotrophic waters) to 91 000 mg Chl-a m(-3) (hypertrophic waters). The EBS performance was evaluated by cross validation, and also using an independent database (Chl-a ranging from 1 to 14 mg m(-3)). Cross-validation results were satisfactory both under high-blooming conditions (R-2 = 0.98, relative RMSE ( RMSEr) = 15%, relative Bias (BIASr) = -2%, and relative Nash (NASHr) = 0.95) and at the initialization of blooms (R-2 = 0.77, RMSEr = 37%, BIASr = -8%, and NASHr = 0.70). The EBS also performed well on the independent database (R-2 = 0.93, RMSEr = 50%, BIASr = -27%, and NASHr = 0.70). A visual comparison mapping Chl-a on the Missisquoi Bay of Lake Champlain additionally illustrates the potential of the EBS to detect early phases of algal growth contrary to other models (adaptive model, Kharu, and APProach by Elimination). This approach is a proof of concept for a more efficient way to quantify algal biomass from remote sensing and could be exported to any types of satellite imagery in a context of water quality monitoring.

TI  - Relating Aerial Deposition of <i>Entomophaga maimaiga</i> Conidia (Zoopagomycota: Entomophthorales) to Mortality of Gypsy Moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) Larvae and Nearby Defoliation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We collected data on mortality of late-instar gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), from outbreak populations over 4 wk in June 2017 at 10 sites in the New England region of the United States, along with estimated rainfall at these sites. Deposition of airborne conidia of the fungal pathogen, Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu & R.S. Soper, was measured at these same sites as well as at seven other locations in New England. We also quantified the geographical distribution of gypsy moth-caused defoliation in New England in 2017 and 2018 from Landsat imagery. Weekly mortality of gypsy moth larvae caused by E. maimaiga correlated with local deposition of conidia from the previous week, but not with rainfall. Mortality from this pathogen reached a peak during the last 2 wk of gypsy moth larval development and always exceeded that caused by LdNPV, the viral pathogen of gypsy moth that has long been associated with gypsy moth outbreaks, especially prior to 1989. Cotesia melanoscela (Ratzeburg ) was by far the most abundant parasitoid recovered and caused an average of 12.6% cumulative parasitism, but varied widely among sites. Deposition of E. maimaiga conidia was highly correlated with percent land area defoliated by gypsy moths within distances of 1 and 2 km but was not significantly correlated with defoliation at distances greater than 2 km.This is the first study to relate deposition of airborne conidia of E. maimaiga to mortality of gypsy moths from that agent.

TI  - Occurrence of horizontal transmission in layer chickens after administration of an <i>in ovo</i> strain F <i>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</i> vaccine
T2  - POULTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In ovo vaccination is currently being considered as a means of delivery for live Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) vaccines. This study was performed to determine the transmissibility of strain F MG (FMG) from in ovo-vaccinated chicks to non-vaccinated pen mates. Eggs from an MG clean flock were incubated together for 18 D, at which point all live embryonated eggs were either not injected or administered a dilution of an FMG vaccine at 10(6) CFU per dose, 1 x 10(4) CFU per dose, 1 x 10(2) CFU per dose, or 1 CFU per dose. Non-injected eggs were hatched in a separate incubator. Ten non-injected, sentinel birds, and 1 in ovo-vaccinated FMG chick were placed in each of 32 isolation units located in 2 replicate rooms (8 replicates per dose). At 6 wk of age, surviving birds that had been vaccinated in ovo were removed, swabbed for FMG detection by PCR, and bled for serum plate agglutination (SPA) and ELISA testing for the presence of antibodies against MG (1, 2, 6, and all 8 in ovo-vaccinated chicks in the 10(6), 10(4), 10(2), and 1 CFU dosages). At 12 wk of age, the remaining sentinel birds were likewise sampled. No sentinel birds died. The in ovo-vaccinated birds that survived to 6 wk were serologically positive except for 5 birds in the 1 CFU treatment. The percentages of MG-positive sentinel birds and sentinel birds with antibody production against MG at 12 wk from each unit were not different between all MG dosages (P = 0.48, PCR; P = 0.77, SPA; P = 0.85, ELISA). Body weights of the in ovo-vaccinated chicks at 6 wk of age (P = 0.43) and the sentinel birds at 12 wk of age (P = 0.95) were each not affected by FMG treatment. These findings indicate that layer chickens in ovo vaccinated with a live-attenuated FMG vaccine were capable of transmitting FMG to other chicks with which they were in direct contact.

TI  - Four Dimensional Mapping of Vegetation Moisture Content Using Dual-Wavelength Terrestrial Laser Scanning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has shown potential in measuring vegetation biochemical traits in three dimensions (3D) by using reflectance derived from backscattered intensity data. The 3D estimates can provide information about the vertical heterogeneity of canopy biochemical traits which affects canopy reflectance but cannot be measured from spaceborne and airborne optical remote sensing data. Leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT), a metric widely used in vegetation health monitoring, has been successfully linked to the normalized difference index (NDI) of near and shortwave infrared wavelengths at the leaf level. However, only two previous studies have linked EWT to NDI at the canopy level in field campaigns. In this study, an NDI consisting of 808 and 1550 nm wavelengths was used to generate 3D EWT estimates at the canopy level in a broadleaf mixed-species tree plot during and after a heatwave. The relative error in EWT estimates was 6% across four different species. Temporal changes in EWT were measured, and the accuracy varied between trees, a factor of the errors in EWT estimates on both dates. Vertical profiles of EWT were generated for six trees and showed vertical heterogeneity and variation between species. The change in EWT vertical profiles during and after the heatwave differed between trees, demonstrating that trees reacted in different ways to the drought condition.

AB  - Recently, significant reserves of oil were discovered off the coast of Lagos State, southwest Nigeria. The lateral situation or compositions of the oil-bearing deposits is not clear because these findings are based on a particular position of a single well. The conventional methods of oil exploration have shown a fundamental theoretical shortcoming that may not be resolved, hence scientists or professionals may have to keep modifying the theories to explore different geological terrain. In this study, the remote sensing technique was adopted. The dataset were adopted from MERRA, Landsat 8 OLI and ETM imagery. The temperature distributions (soil and geothermal temperature) over the research area were calculated using existing algorithms to compliment the satellite remote sensing results. A prospective hydrocarbon deposits was suggested for further research work.

TI  - Natural disasters and regional development - the case of earthquakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the impact of earthquakes on nighttime lights at a sub-national level, i.e., on grids of different size. We argue that existing studies on the impact of natural disasters on economic development have several important limitations, both at the level of the outcome variable as well as at the level of the independent variable, e.g., the timing of an event and the measuring of its intensity. We aim to overcome these limitations by using geophysical event data on earthquakes together with satellite nighttime lights. Using panel fixed effects regressions covering the entire world for the period 1992-2013, we find that earthquakes reduce both light growth rates and light levels significantly. The effects persist for approximately 5 years, but we find no long-run effects. Effects are stronger the smaller the area of a unit of observation. National institutions and economic conditions are relevant moderating factors.

TI  - On C-Band Quad-Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar Properties of Ocean Surface Currents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new results for ocean surface current signatures in dual co- and cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. C-band RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized SAR ocean scenes are decomposed into resonant Bragg scattering from regular (non-breaking) surface waves and scattering from breaking waves. Surface current signatures in dual co- and cross-polarized SAR images are confirmed to be governed by the modulations due to wave breaking. Due to their small relaxation scale, short Bragg waves are almost insensitive to surface currents. Remarkably, the contrast in sensitivity of the non-polarized contribution to dual co-polarized signals is found to largely exceed, by a factor of about 3, the contrast in sensitivity of the corresponding cross-polarized signals. A possible reason for this result is the co- and cross-polarized distinct scattering mechanisms from breaking waves: for the former, quasi-specular radar returns are dominant, whereas for the latter, quasi-resonant scattering from the rough breaking crests governs the backscatter intensity. Thus, the differing sensitivity can be related to distinct spectral intervals of breaking waves contributing to co- and cross-polarized scattering in the presence of surface currents. Accordingly, routinely observed current signatures in quad-polarized SAR images essentially originate from wave breaking modulations, and polarized contrasts can therefore help quantitatively retrieve the strength of surface current gradients.

TI  - Benefits of Organized Mammographic Screening Programs in Women Aged 50 to 69 years: A Surgical Perspective
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of organized mammography screening has been questioned by some authors. We evaluated the benefits of mammographic screening from a surgical point of view through a comparative study. Patients belonging to an organized screening program had a higher probability to receive less invasive treatment, such as breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy, and to have a shorter hospital stay. Our results support the use of campaigns aimed at increasing adhesion to mammography screening.Background: The benefits of organized mammographic screening programs (OMSPs) in reducing breast cancer mortality have been addressed by several studies. This study was designed to specifically evaluate the advantages of OMPSs in terms of surgical management of patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Surgical treatment of 201 patients with breast cancer aged 50 to 69 years coming from OMSPs was compared with that of 532 non-OMSP patients in same age group. The likelihood of receiving BCS was analyzed through a multivariable regression model. Results: The mean tumor size was smaller in the OMSP patients (14 mm vs. 18 mm; P < .01). The proportion of patients having metastatic lymph nodes was higher in the non-OMSP group (33.3% vs. 17.9%; P < .01). Rates of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) were significantly higher in the OMSP group (89.1% vs. 59.1%; P < .01). Sentinel node biopsy was carried out in 84.1% and 62.5% of patients in the OMSP and non-OMSP groups, respectively (P < .01). Rates of axillary lymph node dissection were significantly different (24.9% in the OMSP group and 35.8% in the non-OMSP group; P = .02). Re-excisions for infiltrated margins after BCS were lower in the OMSP group (4.8% vs. 12.7%; P < .01). Hospital stay was shorter in the OMSP group (2.13 vs. 3.02 days; P < .01). OMPS women had a 3-fold higher probability of receiving BCS. Conclusions: Patients with breast cancer belonging to OMSPs had a higher probability to receive less invasive surgery and to have shorter hospital stay. Our results support the use of campaigns aimed at increasing adhesion to mammography screening. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Multilevel Mapping Strategy to Calculate the Information Content of Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the multiscale characteristics of the human visual system and any natural scene, the spatial autocorrelation of remotely sensed imagery, and the multilevel spatial structure of ground targets in remote sensing images, an information-measurement approach based on a single-level geometrical mapping model can only reflect partial feature information at a single level (e.g., global statistical information and local spatial distribution information). The single mapping model cannot validly characterize the information of the multilevel and multiscale features of the spatial structures inherent in remotely sensed images. Additionally, the validity, practicability, and application range of the results of single-level mapping models are greatly limited in practical applications. In this paper, we present the multilevel geometrical mapping entropy (MGME) model to evaluate the information content of related attribute characteristics contained in remotely sensed images. Subsequently, experimental images with different types of objects, including reservoir area, farmland, water area (i.e., water and trees), and mountain area, were used to validate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only reflect the difference in the information of images in terms of spectrum features, spatial structural features, and visual perception but also eliminates the inadequacy of a single-level mapping model. That is, the multilevel mapping strategy is feasible and valid. Additionally, the vector set of the MGME method and its standard deviation (Std) value can be used to further explore and study the spatial dependence of ground scenes and the difference in the spatial structural characteristics of different objects.

TI  - LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT USING GIS-BASED MODEL AND REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is one of the disasters, which occurs throughout the world under all climatic conditions and terrain. This leads to the loss of lives and property and damage to the natural environment. Therefore, a need arises for the landslide hazard zonation for the identification of potential landslide areas. This research is an attempt towards modeling the landslide using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Phuentsholing-Pasakha highway has been selected for the study due to its importance in the economy of the country. Parameters causing landslides were determined through a thorough literature review and field investigations. These parameters were then converted in the form of maps using ArcGIS 10 software. The weights for each parameter were assigned using a bivariate statistical analysis method for spatial analysis in GIS. Landslide hazard map has been obtained, which demarcates the study area into three levels of hazard viz. high, medium, and low danger. About 19.35% of the area falls under high hazard, 30.55% falls under medium hazard, and 50.10% area falls under low risk.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize clinical, histological, and outcome features of primary melanoma in 1329 patients managed at a single-center institution between 2000 and 2010. Parameters included age at diagnosis, sex, tumor location, histology, stage, Breslow thickness, and sentinel lymph node status among others. The mean age at diagnosis was 59.1 +/- 16.7 years. Women were significantly younger than men when diagnosed (57.2 vs. 61.0 years; p < 0.001). Most melanomas (83%) were diagnosed on typically sun-exposed skin areas. Superficial spreading melanoma (39.5%) was the most frequent histological subtype. The median Breslow thickness was significantly higher for men compared to women (1.10mm vs. 0.90mm; p = 0.018). 38.3% of patients with positive and 12.9% of patients with negative sentinel biopsies progressed. Five-year survival analysis for a sub-cohort of 577 patients showed better 5-year overall survival for woman compared to men (75.8% vs. 63.6%; p = 0.025). Our findings indicate differences in patient characteristics between men and women, and underscore the importance of early melanoma detection to prevent disease progression.

TI  - A Preferential Interval-Valued Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm for Remotely Sensed Imagery Classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery classification have a large amount of uncertainty related to the intraclass heterogeneity and the interclass ambiguity of objects. Fuzzy set theory can address the uncertainty effectively, while interval-valued model can improve the separability of samples. Therefore, we propose a novel interval-valued fuzzy c-means algorithm, which integrates the intervalvalued model and preferential adaptive method. It preferentially adjusts the interval width according to MSE (mean-square-error) and boundary factor for determining the optimal set of features for the data. In this paper, it is proved that the method can make the intraclass MSE and boundary factor always proportional to the separability of objects, so that it can dynamically adjust the interval-valued separability by controlling the interval width. Experimental data consisting of SPOT5 (10-m spatial resolution) satellite data for three case study areas in China are used to test this algorithm. Compared with other state-of-the-art fuzzy classification methods, our algorithm demonstrates the markedly improved overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients.

TI  - Post-launch calibration and validation of the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on FY-4A
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder(GIIRS)on board FY-4A is an infrared Fourier transform spectrometer. The primary use of GIIRS is to support numerical weather predictions by providing improved temperature and water vapor profile information,which requires high radiometric precision and accuracy. To meet the requirement,post-launch GIIRS calibration and validation activities were carried out. The spectral calibration has been done through determining the effective sampling frequency which is to take advantage of gaseous line center positions known to high accuracy. The radiometric calibration has been performed through using observation of hot and cold black body reference sources as the basis for two-point calibrations at each wavenumber. The amplitude of some spectrum bands was reduced,which may be caused by some materials gradually releasing a little gas. The estimated absolute spectral calibration uncertainty is 10 ppm,and the mean brightness temperature differences between GIIRS observations and IASI observations are all less than 1 K in the long-wave and mid-wave band.

TI  - Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Intersensor Vegetation Estimation via Constrained Topic Modeling
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents a novel intersensor vegetation estimation framework, which aims at combining Sentinel-2 (S2) spatial resolution with Sentinel-3 (S3) spectral characteristics in order to generate fused vegetation maps. On the one hand, the multispectral instrument (MSI), carried by S2, provides high spatial resolution images. On the other hand, the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), one of the instruments of S3, captures the Earth's surface at a substantially coarser spatial resolution but using smaller spectral bandwidths, which makes the OLCI data more convenient to highlight specific spectral features and motivates the development of synergetic fusion products. In this scenario, the approach presented here takes advantage of the proposed constrained probabilistic latent semantic analysis (CpLSA) model to produce intersensor vegetation estimations, which aim at synergically exploiting MSI's spatial resolution and OLCI's spectral characteristics. Initially, CpLSA is used to uncover the MSI reflectance patterns, which are able to represent the OLCI-derived vegetation. Then, the original MSI data are projected onto this higher abstraction-level representation space in order to generate a high-resolution version of the vegetation captured in the OLCI domain. Our experimental comparison, conducted using four data sets, three different regression algorithms, and two vegetation indices, reveals that the proposed framework is able to provide a competitive advantage in terms of quantitative and qualitative vegetation estimation results.

TI  - Intersensor Remote Sensing Image Registration Using Multispectral Semantic Embeddings
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents a novel intersensor registration framework specially designed to register Sentinel-3 (S3) operational data using the Sentinel-2 (S2) instrument as a reference. The substantially higher resolution of the Multispectral Instrument (MSI), on-board S2, with respect to the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), carried by S3, makes the former sensor a suitable spatial reference to finely adjust OLCI products. Nonetheless, the important spectral-spatial differences between both instruments may constrain traditional registration mechanisms to effectively align data of such different nature. In this context, the proposed registration scheme advocates the use of a topic model-based embedding approach to conduct the intersensor registration task within a common multispectral semantic space, where the input imagery is represented according to their corresponding spectral feature patterns instead of the low-level attributes. Thus, the OLCI products can be effectively registered to the MSI reference data by aligning those hidden patterns that fundamentally express the same visual concepts across the sensors. The experiments, conducted over four different S2 and S3 operational data collections, reveal that the proposed approach provides performance advantages over six different intersensor registration counterparts.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming to subsidize the rational water resources management, an R package called "agriwater" was created in order to obtain the energy balance on the soil and actual evapotranspiration using satellite imagery and agrometeorological data. This package apply the Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving - SAFER to calculate the evapotranspiration fraction ETr (or ETA ET0-1), actual evapotranspiration (ETA) and latent heat flux (lambda E); the Slob equation calculate the net radiation (R-N); ground heat flux (G) is modeled from R-N; and the sensible heat flux (H) is retrieved as the residue of the energy balance equation. Landsat-8 (with and without thermal bands), Sentinel-2 and MODIS digital images can be used. Results are presented in raster format and can be post-processed by GIS analysis or anothers R procedures. A study case using Sentinel-2 images and agrometeorological data of a semiarid area from Brazil was performed. The requirements and conditions for use of the package are explained.

AB  - The detection of wind turbines in a strong clutter background is analyzed at variance of polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) configurations. The area of interest is the intertidal zone near Jiangsu, China and two detectors are used, the polarimetric notch filter (PNF) and a change detector that optimizes the ratio between covariance matrices. The detection performance is quantitatively analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, while the scattering mechanisms that characterize wind turbines are analyzed using the Yamaguchi decomposition. Experimental analysis shows that: 1) wind turbines result in a nontrivial scattering mechanism and 2) full-polarimetric measurements achieve the best detection performance independently of the two detectors.

TI  - An approach to forecast grain crop yield using multi-layered, multi-farm data sets and machine learning
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many broadacre farmers have a time series of crop yield monitor data for their fields which are often augmented with additional data, such as soil apparent electrical conductivity surveys and soil test results. In addition there are now readily available national and global datasets, such as rainfall and MODIS, which can be used to represent the crop-growing environment. Rather than analysing one field at a time as is typical in precision agriculture research, there is an opportunity to explore the value of combining data over multiple fields/farms and years into one dataset. Using these datasets in conjunction with machine learning approaches allows predictive models of crop yield to be built. In this study, several large farms in Western Australia were used as a case study, and yield monitor data from wheat, barley and canola crops from three different seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) that covered similar to 11 000 to similar to 17 000 hectares in each year were used. The yield data were processed to a 10 m grid, and for each observation point associated predictor variables in space and time were collated. The data were then aggregated to a 100 m spatial resolution for modelling yield. Random forest models were used to predict crop yield of wheat, barley and canola using this dataset. Three separate models were created based on pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions to explore the changes in the predictive ability of the model as more within-season information became available. These time points also coincide with points in the season when a management decision is made, such as the application of fertiliser. The models were evaluated with cross-validation using both fields and years for data splitting, and this was assessed at the field spatial resolution. Cross-validated results showed the models predicted yield relatively accurately, with a root mean square error of 0.36 to 0.42 t ha(-1), and a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.89 to 0.92 at the field resolution. The models performed better as the season progressed, largely because more information about within-season data became available (e.g. rainfall). The more years of yield data that were available for a field, the better the predictions were, and future work should use a longer time-series of yield data. The generic nature of this method makes it possible to apply to other agricultural systems where yield monitor data is available. Future work should also explore the integration of more data sources into the models, focus on predicting at finer spatial resolutions within fields, and the possibility of using the yield forecasts to guide management decisions.

AB  - The SWIR-radiance FRP method is applied to the Along Track Scanning Radiometer series of sensors, and the follow-on Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) sensor to provide both the longest and the most recent assessment of global gas flaring activity to date. Our inventory covers more than two decades, and demonstrates that total flare site numbers peak in 2008 (similar to 14,000 global 1-arcminute grid cells containing flares) and that since then there has been an overall reduction to mid-2018 (similar to 10,400 cells) When considering radiant heat output (SWIR-radiance derived FRP), a downward global trend identified between 2000 (similar to 15.1 GW) and 2011 (similar to 12.4 GW) has stalled, with a slight increase observed by mid-2018 (similar to 13 GW). We also find through calibration against flared gas quantities derived from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP) satellites, that 131 billion cubic metres of natural gas has been flared globally between May 2017 and May 2018.

TI  - Shiga toxin sub-type 2a increases the efficiency of <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157 transmission between animals and restricts epithelial regeneration in bovine enteroids
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific Escherichia coli isolates lysogenised with prophages that express Shiga toxin (Stx) can be a threat to human health, with cattle being an important natural reservoir. In many countries the most severe pathology is associated with enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serogroups that express Stx subtype 2a. In the United Kingdom, phage type (PT) 21/28 O157 strains have emerged as the predominant cause of life-threatening EHEC infections and this phage type commonly encodes both Stx2a and Stx2c toxin types. PT21/28 is also epidemiologically linked to super-shedding (>10(3) cfu/g of faeces) which is significant for inter-animal transmission and human infection as demonstrated using modelling studies. We demonstrate that Stx2a is the main toxin produced by stx2a(+)/stx2c(+) PT21/28 strains induced with mitomycin C and this is associated with more rapid induction of gene expression from the Stx2a-encoding prophage compared to that from the Stx2c-encoding prophage. Bacterial supernatants containing either Stx2a and/or Stx2c were demonstrated to restrict growth of bovine gastrointestinal organoids with no restriction when toxin production was not induced or prevented by mutation. Isogenic strains that differed in their capacity to produce Stx2a were selected for experimental oral colonisation of calves to assess the significance of Stx2a for both super-shedding and transmission between animals. Restoration of Stx2a expression in a PT21/28 background significantly increased animal-to-animal transmission and the number of sentinel animals that became super-shedders. We propose that while both Stx2a and Stx2c can restrict regeneration of the epithelium, it is the relatively rapid and higher levels of Stx2a induction, compared to Stx2c, that have contributed to the successful emergence of Stx2a+ E. coli isolates in cattle in the last 40 years. We propose a model in which Stx2a enhances E. coli O157 colonisation of in-contact animals by restricting regeneration and turnover of the colonised gastrointestinal epithelium.Author summary Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157 strains are found in cattle where they are asymptomatic, while human exposure can lead to severe symptoms including bloody diarrhoea and kidney damage due to the activity of Shiga toxin (Stx). The most serious symptoms in humans are associated with isolates that encode Stx subtype 2a. The advantage of these toxins in the animal reservoir is still not clear, however there is experimental evidence implicating Stx with increased bacterial adherence, immune modulation and suppression of predatory protozoa. In this study, the hypothesis that Stx2a is important for super-shedding and calf-to-calf transmission was tested by comparing excretion and transmission dynamics of E. coli O157 strains with and without Stx2a. While Stx2a did not alter excretion levels when calfs were orally challenge, it enabled colonisation of more in contact 'sentinel' animals in our transmission model. We show that Stx2a is generally induced more rapidly than Stx2c, resulting in increased levels of Stx2a expression. Both Stx2a and Stx2c were able to restrict cellular proliferation of epithelial cells in cultured bovine enteroids. Taken together, we propose that rapid production of Stx2a and its role in establishing E. coli O157 colonisation in the bovine gastrointestinal tract facilitate effective transmission and have led to its expansion in the cattle E. coli O157 population.

TI  - CloudFCN: Accurate and Robust Cloud Detection for Satellite Imagery with Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud masking is of central importance to the Earth Observation community. This paper deals with the problem of detecting clouds in visible and multispectral imagery from high-resolution satellite cameras. Recently, Machine Learning has offered promising solutions to the problem of cloud masking, allowing for more flexibility than traditional thresholding techniques, which are restricted to instruments with the requisite spectral bands. However, few studies use multi-scale features (as in, a combination of pixel-level and spatial) whilst also offering compelling experimental evidence for real-world performance. Therefore, we introduce CloudFCN, based on a Fully Convolutional Network architecture, known as U-net, which has become a standard Deep Learning approach to image segmentation. It fuses the shallowest and deepest layers of the network, thus routing low-level visible content to its deepest layers. We offer an extensive range of experiments on this, including data from two high-resolution sensors-Carbonite-2 and Landsat 8-and several complementary tests. Owing to a variety of performance-enhancing design choices and training techniques, it exhibits state-of-the-art performance where comparable to other methods, high speed, and robustness to many different terrains and sensor types.

TI  - Can woody vegetation in valley bottoms protect from gully erosion? Insights using remote sensing data (1938-2016) from subhumid NW Ethiopia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data can be used to improve our understanding of environmental change over longer periods. Here, we used a series of orthorectified aerial photographs of 1938-1940 and 1957 and recent satellite images of 2014-2016 to explore trends and patterns of woody vegetation cover in the Lake Tana Basin of northwestern Ethiopia, and to understand how land cover changes influence gully dynamics. Woody vegetation was mapped using a supervised image classification and gully networks were mapped on-screen from randomly chosen sites distributed across the region. Woody vegetation cover has drastically changed over the past 78 years. From an overall cover of about 20% in 1938-1940 and 1957, woody vegetation cover dropped to 9.8% in 2014-2016. Areas that were subjected to agricultural extensification saw woody vegetation cover drop by nearly 70%. Paddock trees, woodlots, and forests have largely been transformed into cropland. Remarkably, most valley bottoms were vegetated in 1938-1957. Concomitant to the woody vegetation loss, gully networks expanded over the study period. From 1938-1957 to 2014-2016, gully density increased from 0.5-1 to 1.9 km km(-2). The interrelation between both was most remarkable for valley bottoms, where the loss of woody vegetation has been paralleled by the development of gully networks and multiplication of gully heads. Based on visual observations, we hypothesize that as part of indigenous knowledge on erosion control, past societies may have allowed vegetation regrowth in valley bottoms to protect against erosion.

TI  - Tumor-infiltrating CD4<SUP>+</SUP> and CD8<SUP>+</SUP> lymphocytes and macrophages are associated with prognostic factors in triple-negative canine mammary complex type carcinoma
T2  - RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the association of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells and tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) with the clinical parameters of female dogs harboring mammary gland tumors. Thirty female dogs affected with mammary carcinomas were used, and all tumors were histologically classified as complex carcinoma and were triple-negative phenotype determined by immunohistochemistry. Freshly frozen sections were used to determine CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by immunohistochemistry, and TIMs were determined by immunofluorescence assays. Ten out of the 30 dogs showed lymph node metastasis at diagnosis. Fifteen dogs had a tumor of grade I (15/30), nine (9/30) had a tumor of grade II and six (6/30) had a tumor of grade III. The mean overall survival was 680.5 days ( +/- 200.4). Dogs with sentinel lymph node positivity (10/30) (P = .0035) and dogs that developed metastasis (P = .0001) showed a shorter survival time. In addition, dogs with a high level of inflammatory infiltrate in tumor tissues presented a shorter survival time (P = .0001) than that of other dogs. Dogs with tumors containing higher numbers of CD3+ T cells (P = .001), CD4+ T cells (P = .001), or TIM cells (P < .0001) showed a shorter survival time than that of other dogs. Our results suggested that characteristics of immune cell infiltrates, including CD3(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and TIMs, can be used as potential prognostic indicators for predicting clinical outcomes in dogs with mammary gland tumors, particularly tumors with a complex histological subtype and triple-negative phenotype.

TI  - Monitoring of Urbanization and Analysis of Environmental Impact in Stockholm with Sentinel-2A and SPOT-5 Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been substantial urban growth in Stockholm, Sweden, the fastest-growing capital in Europe. The intensifying urbanization poses challenges for environmental management and sustainable development. Using Sentinel-2 and SPOT-5 imagery, this research investigates the evolution of land-cover change in Stockholm County between 2005 and 2015, and evaluates urban growth impact on protected green areas, green infrastructure and urban ecosystem service provision. One scene of 2015 Sentinel-2A multispectral instrument (MSI) and 10 scenes of 2005 SPOT-5 high-resolution instruments (HRI) imagery over Stockholm County are classified into 10 land-cover categories using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, textural and geometric features. Reaching accuracies of approximately 90%, the classifications are then analyzed to determine impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2005 and 2015, including land-cover change statistics, landscape-level urban ecosystem service provision bundle changes and evaluation of regional and local impact on legislatively protected areas as well as ecologically significant green infrastructure networks. The results indicate that urban areas increased by 15%, while non-urban land cover decreased by 4%. In terms of ecosystem services, changes in proximity of forest and low-density built-up areas were the main cause of lowered provision of temperature regulation, air purification and noise reduction. There was a decadal ecosystem service loss of 4.6 million USD (2015 exchange rate). Urban areas within a 200 m buffer zone around the Swedish environmental protection agency's nature reserves increased 16%, with examples of urban areas constructed along nature reserve boundaries. Urban expansion overlapped the deciduous ecological corridor network and green wedge/core areas to a small but increasing degree, often in close proximity to weak but important green links in the landscape. Given these findings, increased conservation/restoration focus on the region's green weak links is recommended.

TI  - Hair regrowth using a properly fitted scalp cooling cap during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CANCER CONFERENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with breast cancer desire to avoid chemotherapy-induced alopecia because it induces mental stress during treatment. Scalp cooling can suppress chemotherapy-induced alopecia without increasing the risk of scalp metastasis; however, in certain cases, alopecia cannot be prevented. The use of properly fitted scalp cooling caps has not yet been explored in Asian patients. Here, we report a case of hair regrowth using a properly fitted scalp cooling cap during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. A 51-year-old Japanese woman who was recalled by screening mammography for grouped amorphous calcifications and architectural distortion visited our hospital. Preoperative diagnosis was cT2N0M0 cStage IIA. Sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed axillary metastasis; hence, left mastectomy and axillary lymph node resection were performed. Pathological diagnosis revealed ER/PgR-positive and HER2-negative invasive lobular carcinoma (pT3N2M0 pStage IIIA). Adjuvant chemotherapy comprising four cycles of docetaxel every 3 weeks as well as four cycles of FEC every 3 weeks was performed with scalp cooling. After the first cycle of docetaxel, a 10-cm oval hair loss patch was observed at the vertex of the patient's head. Assuming the scalp cooling cap was not efficiently in contact with the vertex of the patient's head, we modified and properly fit the scalp cooling cap. After the third cycle of docetaxel, hair regrowth at the vertex began and gradually increased during chemotherapy. The patient did not require hair wigs during and after adjuvant chemotherapy. The scalp cooling cap should be carefully fitted at the vertex of the head, which is difficult to be covered, particularly in the case of Japanese patients. In addition, further development of properly fitted scalp cooling caps suitable for various individuals is necessary.

TI  - The Prospect of the Development of a Creative Personality of a "Trans-Professional" in the Conditions of Changes in the Scientific and Educational Paradigm of the University
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a project for the development of a creative personality of a trans-professional in the context of education based on the transcommunicative paradigm. The article indicates the crisis of higher education in the transition to a post-industrial society. A social request for a creative person with a trans-professional outlook contradicts formal education, which leads to the degradation of creative and personal dimensions of an individual. The transdisciplinary development of modem sciences and the new scientific worldview lead to a new synthesis of the holodynamic and noodynamic paradigms as the basis for the synthesis of natural and human sciences in education and research projects. In this context, a new image of a university is being formed as a source of a new transcommunicative culture and a trans-professional worldview. The generalization of the latest results of the studies of quantum holodynamics in physics and imaginative neurodynamics in psychology makes it possible to build new ecologically relevant models of transdisciplinary educational programs and scientific and technological solutions. On the basis of the synthesis of the holodynamic and noodynamic paradigms, the authors propose a conceptual and phenomenological scheme of transcommunication, in which the qualities of a trans-professional creative personality are harmoniously revealed and developed. The article shows that a person masters the contexts of life, education and science with multiple scales that evoke four significant transcommunicative culture formations: (1) moments of spontaneous meetings, at which stress-trans-formation reveals something new in the unknown thus creating new trans-meanings; (2) transcommunicative meaningful situations, in which, thanks to syntony and synesthesia, the ability to mutual synchronous feedback arises. (3) transcommunicative environments, in which intuitive insight manifests itself in contact; creative originality of discourse occurs in conversations; ingenious problem solving happens in discussion; delicate wisdom occurs in relationships; (4) in transcommunicative axiological worlds (of personalities, groups, teams), a proactive selective search for an individual configuration of relations is implemented for optimal creative self-realization. It has been established that active participation in these processes of mastering a transcommunicative culture develops creative leadership as a basic competence of a trans-professional personality. Thus, the transcommunicative paradigm organically combines the development of creative and communicative features of a personality in scientific and educational projects of a university, which in traditional approaches hardly correlate.

TI  - The July 20, 2017 M6.6 Kos Earthquake: Seismic and Geodetic Evidence for an Active North-Dipping Normal Fault at the Western End of the Gulf of Gokova (SE Aegean Sea)
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On July 20, 2017 22:31 UTC, a strong M-w = 6.6 earthquake occurred at shallow depth between Kos Island (Greece) and Bodrum (Turkey). We derive a co-seismic fault model from joint inversion of geodetic data (GNSS and InSAR) assuming that the earthquake can be modelled by the slip of a rectangular fault buried in an elastic and homogeneous half-space. The GNSS observations constrain well most of the model parameters but do not permit to discriminate between south- and north-dipping planes. However, the interferograms, produced from C-band ESA Sentinel 1 data, give a clear preference to the north-dipping plane. We also map surface motion away from the satellite along the Turkish coast (from Bodrum towards the east) which reached about 17 cm onshore islet Karaada. The best-fit model is obtained with a 37 degrees north-dipping, N283 degrees E striking normal fault, in agreement with the published moment tensor solutions. The resolved slip vector is dominantly normal with a slight component of left-lateral motion (15 degrees). The surface projection of the seismic fault outcrops in the Gokova ridge area, a well-developed bathymetric feature inside the western Gulf of Gokova. Our geodetic model fits the pattern of the shallow, north-dipping aftershocks obtained from rigorous relocation of all available recordings in the region (about 1120 events; relocated mainshock is at 36.955 degrees N, 27.448 degrees E; depth at 9.2 km +/- 0.5 km). The relocated aftershocks also indicate clustering at both ends of the rupture and seismicity triggering mainly towards the east and the north, within 2 weeks following the mainshock. We also analysed regional GPS data (interseismic velocities) and obtained an extension rate of 3.2 mm/yr across the Gokova rift, along a direction N165 degrees E.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in oral- oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: standards, new technical procedures, and clinical advances
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To provide substantial coverage and critical appraisal of standards as well as new technical procedures and clinical advances concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Methods The MEDLINE database was searched via the PubMed interface up to January 2019 for the following MeSH heading: "sentinel lymph node biopsy" and "squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck".Results SNB exists as an alternative to elective neck dissection (END) in OSCC. Pre-surgical planar lymphoscintigraphy with intra-operative hand-held gamma probe allows using SNB. Furthermore, the contribution of pre-surgical SPECT/CT improves the sentinel lymph node (SLN) roadmap in sites that are closer to the injection site. Portable gamma camera and freehand SPECT are not yet routine clinical practice, but can further improve intra-operative SLN detection. However, the difficulty in detecting SLNs located closer to the injection site persists. SNB with combined radioactive and near-infrared fluorescence guidance is an attractive option for improving spatial resolution of radio-guided techniques while maintaining depth penetration.Conclusion Numerous studies have demonstrated that SNB can be proposed for accurate histopathological staging of the neck and the guidelines support the introduction of SNB as an alternative to END in T1/T2 N0 OSCC patients. New hybrid imaging techniques, which are offering new possibilities to assist clinicians and surgeons in localizing the site of uptake in sentinel node detection, need to be confirmed in ongoing and future clinical trials. In the future, the integration of new PET tracers could continue along the route mapped out in SNB.

TI  - Evaluating the conservation state of the <i>paramo</i> ecosystem: An object-based image analysis and CART algorithm approach for central Ecuador
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecuadorian paramo ecosystems (EPEs) function as water sources, contain large soil carbon stores and high levels of biodiversity, and support human populations. The EPEs are mainly herbaceous paramo (HP). To inform policy and management and help drive ecological science toward a better understanding of the HP ecosystem, and the relationships among its multiple ecosystem services, we asked: (1) What is the state of the HP regarding its land use/land cover (LULC)?; and (2) Is the HP being pushed away from its natural state or it is regenerating? To answer these questions, we assessed the LULC in central EPEs using Landsat 8 imagery, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm. Results show that two-fifths of the paramo ecosystem remain as native HP (NHP) and two-fifths as anthropogenic HP (AHP). Although the anthropic alteration of the pedogenesis of young paramo soil leads to the establishment of AHP, we found evidence of regeneration and resilience of the NHP. The results of this study will be useful to scientists and decision-makers with interest in paramo ecosystems in central Ecuador. The proposed methodology is simple, fast, and could be implemented in other landscapes to establish comprehensive monitoring systems useful in landscape assessment and planning.

TI  - Current thinking in management of the neck (including contralateral neck) in ipsilateral recurrent or second primary oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Metastasis to the neck in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has a huge impact on long-term survival and prognosis, and its incidence varies. Due consideration therefore should be given to management of the neck in each individual case. The pathways in patients with primary oral SCC are well-established, but there is a paucity of published papers on management of the neck in those with ipsilateral recurrent or second primary oral SCC whose necks have previously been operated on with or without radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, or treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. These patients may be under treated because of failure to stage the most likely drainage site, and are likely to have a worse outcome if there is macroscopic recurrence in the neck after independent treatment of the recurrent or second primary tumour. Based on the current review, we think there is a need for a multicentre, collaborative, retrospective review of the outcomes of patients with ipsilateral second primaries or recurrent oral SCC in the previously treated neck. Our recommendations include consideration of positron emission tomography-computed tomography in all patients with recurrent or second primary oral SCC (if "hot" neck dissection, if "cold" - sentinel node biopsy); consideration of sentinel node biopsy in all patients with recurrent or second primary oral SCC who have previously had treatment to the neck; and finally, consideration of definitive management of the sentinel biopsy zone or region if the node is invaded.

T2  - ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the feasibility of fusion of ultrasound imaging and three-dimensional (3D) single-photon-emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in detecting sentinel lymph nodes in women with vulvar cancer.Methods This was a prospective pilot single-center study. Patients with vulvar cancer who were candidates for sentinel lymph-node biopsy were enrolled between December 2018 and February 2019. Fusion imaging virtual navigation using 3D SPECT/CT and ultrasound was performed to investigate the tumor-draining lymph node. All clinical, imaging, surgical and histological information was collected prospectively and entered into a dedicated Excel file. Feasibility and success of fusion imaging virtual navigation and time needed to perform the three steps of fusion imaging were evaluated.Results Ten lymph-node sites were evaluated in five consecutive women with a histological diagnosis of vulvar cancer. Fusion imaging virtual navigation was feasible and completed successfully for all (10/10) draining sites. Median overall time to perform fusion imaging was 32 (range, 25-40) min and the time decreased from the first to the last examination.Conclusions The present study demonstrated that fusion imaging virtual navigation using 3D SPECT/CT and ultrasound is feasible and able to detect sentinel lymph nodes in women with vulvar carcinoma. Fusion imaging using ultrasound for detection of sentinel lymph nodes opens up multiple diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in gynecological oncology. Copyright (C) 2019 ISUOG.

We perform the switching by decision rule, which is optimized for each signal in the parameter space of this decision rule. Algorithms for factorization and dimension reduction of decision rules are proposed. We investigate new classes of interpolating functions and systems of local features. We propose fitting procedures for adaptive interpolators. We perform the software implementation of the developed algorithms. A numerical experiment in natural multidimensional signals (video, remote sensing data and hyperspectral data) confirms the gain of the adaptive interpolator.

TI  - Mapping annual land use changes in China's poverty-stricken areas from 2013 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China aims to end absolute poverty by 2020. In pursuit of this goal, a series of poverty reduction policies and measures have been proposed. As a vital element of poverty reduction, land use in China's poverty-stricken areas also undergone great changes accordingly. However, the land use change patterns in these areas are not well understood. It's necessary to analyze the spatial-temporal land use change patterns to provide data that support poverty alleviation programs. In this study, we proposed a framework for mapping annual land use changes in China's poverty-stricken areas from 2013 to 2018. The Landsat 8 surface reflectance datasets from 2013 to 2018 (available on Google Earth Engine) were utilized to detect the changes in arable land, built-up land, water, vegetation, and un-used land. The land use transition matrix was computed to describe characteristics of the transition, and a Bayesian hierarchical model was employed to investigate the spatial-temporal land use change patterns. Our results demonstrated that the arable land continuously decreased over the study period, while built-up land and vegetation gradually expanded. The primary land use transition occurred between the arable land and vegetation. The local trends of each county indicated obvious regional differences of land use change. Moreover, significant differences existed between deep poverty-stricken counties and normal poverty-stricken counties on arable land and built-up land change, indicating that more intense human construction activities in normal poverty-stricken areas. The annual land use mapping results generated for poverty-stricken areas, along with further analysis of overall temporal change and local change trends, could provide a better understanding of land use changes and regional differences in China's poverty-stricken areas and promote the poverty reduction and sustainable development in those areas.

TI  - Post-Disaster Building Database Updating Using Automated Deep Learning: An Integration of Pre-Disaster OpenStreetMap and Multi-Temporal Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - First responders and recovery planners need accurate and quickly derived information about the status of buildings as well as newly built ones to both help victims and to make decisions for reconstruction processes after a disaster. Deep learning and, in particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches have recently become state-of-the-art methods to extract information from remote sensing images, in particular for image-based structural damage assessment. However, they are predominantly based on manually extracted training samples. In the present study, we use pre-disaster OpenStreetMap building data to automatically generate training samples to train the proposed deep learning approach after the co-registration of the map and the satellite images. The proposed deep learning framework is based on the U-net design with residual connections, which has been shown to be an effective method to increase the efficiency of CNN-based models. The ResUnet is followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implementation to further refine the results. Experimental analysis was carried out on selected very high resolution (VHR) satellite images representing various scenarios after the 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan in both the damage and the recovery phases in Tacloban, the Philippines. The results show the robustness of the proposed ResUnet-CRF framework in updating the building map after a disaster for both damage and recovery situations by producing an overall F-1-score of 84.2%.

TI  - Contextual Classification of Sea-Ice Types Using Compact Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic classification methods using satellite imagery are beneficial in the sea-ice-type mapping of the Arctic regions. In the near future, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will be launched, providing unique compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, expected to be an improvement over the current RADARSAT-2 dual-polarimetric SAR imagery. This motivates the implementation of a CP-dedicated automatic scene classification approach. First, an existing unsupervised segmentation algorithm called iterative region growing using semantics (IRGS) is used to segment ice-class homogeneous regions to reduce the impact of speckle noise. Second, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the ice-type labels for each homogeneous region. Two complex quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes are used to mathematically simulate the corresponding CP scenes for algorithm testing. Classification accuracy shows that using only the two CP intensity images leads to improved results compared with standard dual-polarimetric scenes. Using the CP data, the best classification results are obtained with the reconstructed QP data for the IRGS segmentation and all derived CP features for the SVM labeling. The results support the expected potential that CP scenes will provide improved sea-ice classification than the current operational dual-pol scenes.

TI  - Wavelet-based 3-phase hybrid SVR model trained with satellite-derived predictors, particle swarm optimization and maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform for solar radiation prediction
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate prediction of global solar radiation (GSR) with remote sensing in metropolitan, regional and remote, yet solar-rich sites, is a core requisite for cleaner energy utilization, monitoring and conversion of renewable energy into usable power. Data-driven models that investigate the feasibility of solar-fueled energies, face challenges in respect to identifying their appropriate input data as such variables may not be available at all sites due to a lack of environmental monitoring system. In this paper, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived predictors are employed to train three-phase hybrid SVR model for monthly GSR prediction. Firstly, to acquire relevant model input features, MODIS variables are screened with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and secondly, a Gaussian emulation method of sensitivity analysis is incorporated on all screened variables to ascertain their relative role in predicting GSR. To address pertinent issues of non-stationarities, PSO selected variables are decomposed with Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation prior to its incorporation in Support Vector Regression (SVR), constructing a three-phase PSO-WSVR hybrid model where the hyper-parameters are acquired by evolutionary (Le., PSO & Genetic Algorithm) and Grid Search methods. Three-phase PSO-W-SVR hybrid model is benchmarked with alternative machine learning models. Thirty-nine model scenarios are formulated: 13 without feature selection (e.g., SVR), 13 with feature selection (e.g., PSO-SVR for two-phase models) and the remainder 13 with feature selection strategy coupled with data decomposition algorithm (e.g., PSO-W-SVR leading to a three-phase model). Metrics such as skill score (RMSEss), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott's (WI), Legates & McCabe's (E-1) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (E-NS) are applied to comprehensively evaluate prescribed models. Empirical results register high performance of three-phase hybrid PSO-W-SVR models, exceeding the prescribed alternative models. High predictive ability evidenced by a low RRMSE and high E-1 ascertains PSO-W-SVR hybrid model as considerably favorable in its capability to be enriched by MODIS satellite-derived variables. Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform algorithm is also seen to provide resolved patterns in satellite variables, leading to a superior performance compared to the other data-driven model. The research avers that a three-phase hybrid PSO-W-SVR model can be a viable tool to predict GSR using satellite derived data as predictors, and is particularly useful for exploration of renewable energies where satellite footprint are present but regular environmental monitoring systems may be absent.

TI  - A reduced stochastic model of core surface dynamics based on geodynamo simulations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We make use of recent geodynamo simulations to propose a reduced stochastic model of the dynamics at the surface of Earth's core. On decadal and longer periods, this model replicates the most energetic eigen directions of the geodynamo computation. Towards shorter timescales, it proposes a compensation for weaknesses of these simulations. This model furthermore accounts for the signature, in the geomagnetic secular variation, of errors of representativeness associated with unresolved processes. We incorporate the reduced stochastic model into a geomagnetic data assimilation algorithm-an augmented state ensemble Kalman filter- and apply it to re-analyse magnetic field changes over the period 1880-2015. Errors of representativeness appear to be responsible for an important fraction of the observed changes in the secular variation, as it is the case in the dynamo simulation.Recovered core surface motions are primarily symmetric with respect to the equator. We observe the persistence of the eccentric westward gyre over the whole studied era and vortices that partly follow isocontours of the radial magnetic field at the core surface. Our flow models provide a good fit to decadal changes in the length-of-day and predict its interannual variations over the period 1940-2005. The largest core flow acceleration patterns are found in an equatorial belt below 10 degrees in latitude and are associated with non-axisymmetric features. No systematic longitudinal drift of acceleration patterns is found, even over the past decades where satellite data are available. The acceleration of the high-latitude westward jet in the Pacific hemisphere is, during the satellite era, a factor 5 smaller than previously reported and its structure shows some evidence for equatorial asymmetry. The era of continuous satellite records provides enhanced contrast on the rapid core flow variations. The proposed assimilation algorithm offers the prospect of evaluating Earth-likeness of geodynamo simulations.

TI  - Biochemical responses of freshwater mussel <i>Unio tumidus</i> to titanium oxide nanoparticles, Bisphenol A, and their combination
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple interactions between different pollutants in the surface waters can cause unpredictable consequences. The aim of the study was to evaluate the combined effect of two widespread xenobiotics, titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2) and bisphenol A (BPA), on freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus. The specimens were exposed for 14 days to TiCl4 (Ti, 1.25 mu M), TiO2 (1.25 mu M), BPA (0.88 nM), or their combination (TiO2 + BPA). Every type of exposure resulted in a particular oxidative stress response: TiO2 had antioxidant effect, decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phenoloxidase (PhO) activity, and doubling reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration in the digestive gland; Ti caused oxidative changes by increasing levels of ROS, PhO and superoxide dismutase; BPA decreased the GSH level by a factor of two. In the co-exposure treatment, these indices as well as lysosomal membrane stability were not affected. All Ti-containing exposures caused elevated levels of metalated metallothionein (Zn,Cu-MT), its ratio to total metallothionein protein, and lactate/pyruvate ratio. Both BPA-containing exposures decreased caspase-3 activity. All exposures, and particularly co-exposure, up-regulated CYP450-dependent oxidation, lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin accumulation, lysosomal cathepsin D and its efflux, as well as alkali-labile phosphates in gonads and caused DNA instability (except for TiO2). To summarize, co-exposure to TiO2 + BPA produced an overlap of certain individual responses but strengthened the damage. Development of water purification technologies using TiO2 requires further studies of the biological effects of its mixtures. U. tumidus can serve as a sentinel organism in such studies.

It has the inconvenience of lymphatics catheterization and is not available for surgical dynamic identification of lymphatics. Isotopic techniques are used for diagnostics and sentinel-node procedures. Colorants and dyes have several advantages: no need for catheterization, not expensive technology, price, availability, easy management. It allows the dynamic identification of lymphatics for surgical resolution of lymph-related complications.

TI  - Temperature assimilation into a coastal ocean-biogeochemical model: assessment of weakly and strongly coupled data assimilation
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data of both physical properties as well as ocean colour can be assimilated into coupled ocean-biogeochemical models with the aim to improve the model state. The physical observations like sea surface temperature usually have smaller errors than ocean colour, but it is unclear how far they can also constrain the biogeochemical model variables. Here, the effect of assimilating satellite sea surface temperature into the coastal ocean-biogeochemical model HBM-ERGOM with nested model grids in the North and Baltic Seas is investigated. A weakly and strongly coupled assimilation is performed with an ensemble Kalman filter. For the weakly coupled assimilation, the assimilation only directly influences the physical variables, while the biogeochemical variables react only dynamically during the 12-hour forecast phases in between the assimilation times. For the strongly coupled assimilation, both the physical and biogeochemical variables are directly updated by the assimilation. The strongly coupled assimilation is assessed in two variants using the actual concentrations and the common approach to use the logarithm of the concentrations of the biogeochemical fields. In this coastal domain, both the weakly and strongly coupled assimilation are stable, but only if the actual concentrations are used for the strongly coupled case. Compared to the weakly coupled assimilation, the strongly coupled assimilation leads to stronger changes of the biogeochemical model fields. Validating the resulting field estimates with independent in situ data shows only a clear improvement for the temperature and for oxygen concentrations, while no clear improvement of other biogeochemical fields was found. The oxygen concentrations were more strongly improved with strongly coupled than weakly coupled assimilation. The experiments further indicate that for the strongly coupled assimilation of physical observations the biogeochemical fields should be used with their actual concentrations rather than the logarithmic concentrations.

TI  - Polarity and attitude effects in the continued-influence paradigm
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Misinformation - information that is false or inaccurate - can continue to influence people's memory and reasoning even after it has been corrected. Researchers have termed this the continued influence effect (CIE). However, to date, research has focused exclusively on examining the CIE in a single polarity, namely the ongoing effect of initially affirmed material that is later negated. No research has yet examined how reliance on outdated information may be affected if this polarity is reversed, that is, if initially-negated information is reinstated. It also remains unclear how participants' pre-existing beliefs may impact the acceptance of a correction, with prior evidence showing conflicting results. To investigate these questions, across two experiments we presented participants scoring high versus low on measures of relevant attitudes with fictional news reports that contained a piece of critical attitude-relevant information. This information was either true throughout, false throughout, initially-affirmed then retracted, or initially-negated then reinstated. Participants' reliance on the critical information was subsequently measured with the use of inferential-reasoning items. Reinstatement of initially-negated information was insufficient to bring reliance on that information to a baseline level - that is, reliance on information presented as true throughout was greater than reliance on negated and then reinstated information. This result was symmetrical with the conventional CIE observed with a reversed polarity. The effect of participants' pre-existing attitudes on continued reliance was equivocal. The results therefore suggest that the CIE is not contingent on polarity, raising questions about the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.

TI  - More realistic land-use and vegetation parameters in a regional climate model reduce model biases over China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate vegetation cover data are important for realistic simulation of regional climate. The default vegetation parameters from Global Land Cover 2000, currently incorporated into global climate models and used in regional climate model RegCM, are not realistic for China, which may have contributed to serious bias in surface climate simulation. In this study, a new set of vegetation parameters considering the Plant Functional Type (PFT) fractions and the corresponding monthly leaf area index (PFT_LAI), were developed based on the land cover and MODIS LAI data sets. The regional climate model RegCM4.5 coupled with the land surface model CLM4.5 were utilized to test the performance of the new vegetation parameters by comparing simulations with observations using different surface parameters. The surface energy balance was analysed to examine the effects of changed vegetation parameters on regional climate. The results showed that the new parameters were more accurate than the GLC2000 parameters when describing the distribution of crops, grassland, and forests over China. The improved vegetation parameters reduced model biases for winter air temperature and precipitation over southern China by 0.9 degrees C and 8%, respectively, and reduced the winter temperature and summer precipitation biases over northeastern China by approximately 0.7 degrees C and 8%, respectively. More accurate surface albedo are the main reasons for reductions in model bias. However, certain biases, such as the cold and dry bias over the Tibetan Plateau, still remained in the simulation results using our new vegetation data.

TI  - Statistical methods for the geochemical characterisation of surface waters: The case study of the Tiber River basin (Central Italy)
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the chemistry of surface waters and their resilience to compositional changes represents a global challenge to preserve them from human- and changing climate-induced modifications. River waters are sentinel parameters for all processes occurring in a river basin. This is particularly true for regional watersheds, which can include both natural- and anthropogenic-sourced solutes such as those present in the Tiber River basin, the biggest one in Central Italy. In this work, innovative applications of statistical methods are proposed, from the perspective of Compositional Data Analysis theory, in order to consider the geochemical riverine system as a whole and detect compositional changes throughout the catchment. Robust compositional biplots highlighted different sources of variability linked to geological (low variability) and anthropogenic origin (high variability) of the main compounds, thus identifying a hierarchy in the variance of the riverine geochemical processes. On a different scale, the innovative use of the robust Mahalanobis distance in an iterative way monitored spatial compositional shifts for single cases. The effectiveness of this method consists in minimising the influence of an individual anomalous point on the compositional centre and the covariance structure of the data highlighting when along the river a significant compositional shift occurs. The study provides powerful compositional tools for detecting potential contamination events or climate-induced modifications both at catchment and river scale.

TI  - Accuracy of Intraoperative Frozen Section of Sentinel Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Carcinoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - False-negative (FN) intraoperative frozen section (FS) results of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) have been reported to be more common after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the primary surgical setting. We evaluated SLN FS assessment in breast cancer patients treated with NAC to determine the FN rate and the histomorphologic factors associated with FN results. Patients who had FS SLN assessment following NAC from July 2008 to July 2017 were identified. Of the 711 SLN FS cases, 522 were negative, 181 positive, and 8 deferred. The FN rate was 5.4% (28/522). There were no false-positive results. Of the 8 deferred cases, 5 were positive on permanent section and 3 were negative. There was a higher frequency of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells in FN cases (P<0.001). There was a significant increase in tissue surface area present on permanent section slides compared with FS slides (P<0.001), highlighting the inherent technical limitations of FS and histologic under-sampling of tissue which leads to most FN results. The majority (25/28, 89%) of FN cases had metastatic foci identified exclusively on permanent sections and were not due to a true diagnostic interpretation error. FN cases were more frequently estrogen receptor positive (P<0.001), progesterone receptor positive (P=0.001), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (P=0.009) and histologic grade 1 (P=0.015), which most likely reflects the lower rates of pathologic complete response in these tumors. Despite its limitations, FS is a reliable modality to assess the presence of SLN metastases in NAC treated patients.

TI  - Analyzing the relationship between historic canopy dynamics and current plant species diversity in the herb layer of temperate forests using long-term Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current plant species diversity of the forest herb layer is influenced by site conditions, seed banks, stand age and historic canopy dynamics, induced for example by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Long-term Landsat time series allow for analyzing forest canopy dynamics over several decades at a spatial resolution of 30 m. These dynamics have not been related to plant diversity in the herb layer of forests yet. Here, we related canopy layer dynamics of 132 one hectare temperate forest plots derived from Landsat time series (1985-2015) to herb layer plant species diversity observed in 2015. To quantitatively characterize the dynamics in the canopy over this period, we applied Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation representation (SAX) to yearly NDVI time series of the plots and calculated the frequency of the representations of similar time series patterns, hereafter called SAX-metrics. We used the SAX-metrics as predictors to estimate with beta regression models the Simpson's diversity index of the herb layer of our forest plots subdivided into six forest types. Models including SAX-metrics, describing abrupt decreases in NDVI, and high, medium, or low NDVI values had pseudo R-2 between 0.13 and 0.63. We conclude that disturbances, canopy closure, as well as stand age, as represented in NDVI time series, influence the diversity in the herb layer in five of the six examined forest types. Our study shows that information on historic canopy dynamics, detected from Landsat time series, can contribute to a better understanding of current herb layer diversity in some forest types. This study gives first indications on the potential of temporal metrics of Landsat time series in biodiversity research.

TI  - Integration of Automatic Identification System (AIS) Data and Single-Channel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images by SAR-Based Ship Velocity Estimation for Maritime Situational Awareness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergic utilization of data from different sources, either ground-based or spaceborne, can lead to effective monitoring of maritime activities. To this end, the integration of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with data reported by the automatic identification system (AIS) is of high interest. Accurate matching of ships detected in SAR images with AIS data requires compensation of the azimuth offset, which depends on the ship's velocity. The existing procedures interpolate the route information gathered by AIS to estimate the ship's velocity at the epoch of the SAR data, to remove the offset. Matching accuracy is limited by interpolation errors and AIS route information unavailability or uncertainties. This paper proposes the use of SAR-based ship velocity estimations to improve the integration of AIS and SAR data. A case study has been analyzed, in which the method has been tested on TerraSAR-X images collected over the Gulf of Naples, Italy. Presented results show that the matching is improved with respect to standard procedures. The proposed method limits the distance between the AIS report and the SAR-based detection to less than 150 m, which is in line with maritime surveillance needs.

TI  - 20 cm resolution mapping of tundra vegetation communities provides an ecological baseline for important research areas in a changing Arctic environment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra vegetation communities are spatially heterogeneous and may vary dramatically from one meter to the next. Consequently, representing Arctic tundra vegetation communities accurately requires very high resolution raster maps (<5m grid cell size). However, using remotely sensed data to produce maps with sufficient spatial detail at an extent appropriate for understanding landscape-scale ecological patterns is challenging. In this study, we used predictor layers derived from airborne lidar and high-resolution (similar to 5 cm) 4-band airborne imagery to classify vegetation communities at 20 cm spatial resolution for three landscapes (12.5 km(2) total) near the Toolik Lake research area in the Alaskan Low Arctic. The maps were built using a Random Forest model that was trained and tested on 800 ground reference plots, using classes derived from commonly used legends on existing polygon maps of the area. Withheld test plots (25% of dataset) had a balanced map accuracy of 0.57, kappa of 0.47, and weighted (fuzzy) kappa of 0.65. These maps provide high-resolution plant community information that can serve as important baseline reference data for vegetation monitoring and change detection in this rapidly changing tundra ecosystem, and as validation for coarser scale maps. They also permit fine-scale characterization of landscape phenomena such as community-level nutrient dynamics and wildlife habitat suitability in an important Arctic research site. Our approach demonstrates that very high resolution mapping results can be achieved and validated by integrating high-resolution remote-sensing datasets from multiple sensors in a machine learning model trained on simple field reference data.

TI  - Predicting Growing Stock Volume of <i>Eucalyptus</i> Plantations Using 3-D Point Clouds Derived from UAV Imagery and ALS Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating forest inventory variables is important in monitoring forest resources and mitigating climate change. In this respect, forest managers require flexible, non-destructive methods for estimating volume and biomass. High-resolution and low-cost remote sensing data are increasingly available to measure three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure and to model forest structural attributes. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the individual tree volume estimates derived from high-density point clouds obtained from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) in Eucalyptus spp. plantations. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques were applied for individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. The ITC algorithm applied correctly detected and delineated 199 trees from ALS-derived data, while 192 trees were correctly identified using DAP-based point clouds acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), representing accuracy levels of respectively 62% and 60%. Addressing volume modelling, non-linear regression fit based on individual tree height and individual crown area derived from the ITC provided the following results: Model Efficiency (Mef) = 0.43 and 0.46, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.030 m(3) and 0.026 m(3), rRMSE = 20.31% and 19.97%, and an approximately unbiased results (0.025 m(3) and 0.0004 m(3)) using DAP and ALS-based estimations, respectively. No significant difference was found between the observed value (field data) and volume estimation from ALS and DAP (p-value from t-test statistic = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). The proposed approaches could also be used to estimate basal area or biomass stocks in Eucalyptus spp. plantations.

TI  - Investigating the urbanization process and its impact on vegetation change and urban heat island in Wuhan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization significantly changes vegetation coverage and heat distribution, which threatens the sustainable development and the quality of life. As the largest developing city in Central China, Wuhan was chosen as the experimental region. This study investigated the urbanization process of Wuhan from 1989 to 2917 based on Landsat data. Combined with MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and LST (Land Surface Temperature) data, vegetation disturbance and surface urban heat island (SUHI) caused by urbanization were discussed for 2001-2017. Furthermore, correlation between increment EVI (urban EVI minus rural EVI) and increment LST (urban LST minus rural LST) was also conducted. The results were as follows: (1) Wuhan experienced a strong urbanization over the past 29 years, with an increasing urban expansion rate and the altered dominant urban expansion pattern (edge expansion and infilling). After the enhanced vegetation functions and urban increased structures, the urbanization finally caused the fragmented patches and irregular urban shapes. (2) Urbanization had a positive effect on LST but a negative effect on EVI. From 2001 to 2017, the highest increasing rate of increment LST for the old urban area (OUA) and urbanized area (UA) was both observed in summer daytime (OUA, 0.106 degrees C/a; UA, 0.207 degrees C/a). The decreasing rate of increment EVI reached the highest value in summer (OUA, 0.00697/a; UA, 0.00298/a). (3) There was a strong negative correlation (except spring and winter for OUA) between increment EVI and increment LST in daytime, which proved that the activity of vegetation in daytime could relieve LST to a certain extent. This study clarifies the dynamic urbanization process of Wuhan and discusses its impacts on vegetation change and SUHI. Efficiently investigating urbanization process and quantifying its impacts on urban environment are critical for regional ecological conservation.

TI  - Evaluation of open-access global digital elevation models (AW3D30, SRTM, and ASTER) for flood modelling purposes
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEM) are fundamental for hydrologic and hydraulic modelling. Many practitioners rely on open-access global data sets due to the cost and sparse coverage of sources of higher resolution. In 2016, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency released the ALOS World 3D-30m (AW3D30), an open-access global elevation model at an horizontal resolution of 30 m. So far no published study has done an assessment of the flood modelling capabilities of this new product. The purpose of this investigation is to (a) assess the utility of the AW3D30 for flood modelling purposes and (b) compare its performance with regards to computed water levels and flood extent maps calculated using other freely available 30m DEM (e.g., SRTM and ASTER). For this comparison, the reference to reality is given by the maps computed using a light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based digital terrain model. This study is carried out in two catchments with contrasting topographic gradients. Results show that AW3D30 performs better than the SRTM. In mountainous regions, the results derived with the AW3D30 are comparable in skill to those obtained with a LiDAR-derived digital surface model. This encouraging performance paves the way to more accurate modelling for both data-scarce regions and global flood models.

TI  - The Impact of China's Grain for Green Program on Rural Economy and Precipitation: A Case Study of Yan River Basin in the Loess Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale deforestation and abandoned planting will bring about the destruction of the ecological environment and the deterioration of the climate. In 1999, China initiated its "Grain for Green" Program (GGP) to improve the ecological environment, control soil erosion, and adjust the agricultural industrial structure to promote the sustainable development of the rural economy. In this paper, economic statistics, rainfall, and remote sensing data are used to analyze the impact of the GGP on agricultural and rural economic development and regional precipitation in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau. The results show that since the implementation of the program, the employment structure of the labor force has changed and the regional economic growth and farmers' income have increased. From 2000 to 2016, the total gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita GDP of the Yan River Basin increased. The conversion of large-scale sloping farmland to forestry and grassland resulted in the decrease of farmland area and the increase of forestry area. The maximum, minimum, and mean value of vegetation coverage increased year by year. With the increase of vegetation coverage, the surface roughness, soil water content, and evapotranspiration improved and annual average precipitation grew significantly after the implementation of the program (2000 to 2018). From 1970 to the implementation of the project (1999), the annual average rainfall decreased at the trough from 1988 to 1999, and there was an overall upward trend from 1970 to 2018. The GGP has an important impact on the economy and people's income in the Yan River Basin, and the vegetation change caused by the variation of land use types has a certain impact on regional rainfall. Under the background of global and regional climate change, it is of great significance to fully understand the impacts of vegetation conversion on climate and its mechanism for objective assessment of driving factors in regional and global climate, as well as for scientific planning of future land use.

TI  - Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from Wildfires Using OCO-2 Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The biomass burning model (BBM) has been the most widely used method for estimation of trace gas emissions. Due to the difficulty and variability in obtaining various necessary parameters of BBM, a new method is needed to quickly and accurately calculate the trace gas emissions from wildfires. Here, we used satellite data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to calculate CO2 emissions from wildfires (the OCO-2 model). Four active wildfires in Siberia were selected in which OCO-2 points intersecting with smoke plumes identified by Aqua MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. MODIS band 8, band 21 and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) data were used to identify the smoke plume area, burned area and smoke plume height, respectively. By contrast with BBM, which calculates CO2 emissions based on the bottom-top mode, the OCO-2 model estimates CO2 emissions based on the top-bottom mode. We used a linear regression model to compute CO2 concentration (XCO2) for each smoke plume pixel and then calculated CO2 emissions for each wildfire point. The CO2 mass of each smoke plume pixel was added to obtain the CO2 emissions from wildfires. After verifying our results with the BBM, we found that the biases were between 25.76% and 157.11% for the four active fires. The OCO-2 model displays the advantages of remote-sensing technology and is a useful tool for fire-emission monitoring, although we note some of its disadvantages. This study proposed a new perspective to estimate CO2 emissions from wildfire and effectively expands the applied range of OCO-2 satellite data.

TI  - Altitudinal forest-tundra ecotone categorization using texture-based classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new technique involving texture-based image classification to categorize altitudinal FTEs by the degree of fragmentation of the interface. This allows a) universally adaptable altitudinal FTE categorization based on widely available satellite data products and b) assessment of sensitivity of altitudinal FTEs to shift with climate change at different locations based on the spatial distribution of the corresponding categories. The FTE categorization scheme used in this study corresponds partly to the globally occurring primary altitudinal FTE 'forms.' Specifically, 'diffuse' and 'abrupt' FTEs are recognized and separated. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery is used for FTE delineation and categorization. A technique named FOurier-based Textural Ordination (FOTO) is implemented to extract textural information based on NDVI variations in image windows, and supervised classification is used to further separate these windows into FTE categories based on texture. The analysis is conducted on part of the Khibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula, Russia, and further tested on six other study areas spread across the circumarctic region. The proposed method is able to adapt to different study areas with minimum changes in parameterization, and effectively extract altitudinal FTEs and categorize them into different FTE forms with satisfactory accuracies.

TI  - Spatial Pattern of Soil Erosion Drivers and the Contribution Rate of Human Activities on the Loess Plateau from 2000 to 2015: A Boundary Line from Northeast to Southwest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Loess Plateau is one of the most fragile areas in the world, where the problem of soil erosion is particularly prominent. The spatial and temporal variation characteristics and mechanisms of soil erosion in this region have always been hot topics for researchers. In this study, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is used to estimate the soil erosion modulus of the Loess Plateau from 2000 to 2015, the dynamic characteristics of its temporal and spatial variations and driving mechanisms are determined, and meteorological data are combined with remote sensing data to quantitatively calculate the contribution rate of human activities. The results show that from 2000 to 2015, the soil erosion modulus of the Loess Plateau had a downward trend as a whole, with a rate of -0.6408 t/ha/a, but the downward trend gradually slowed down. Precipitation mainly resulted in changes in the soil erosion modulus in the northwestern part of the Loess Plateau, where a significant positive correlation was seen. Meanwhile, the Vegetation Fractional Coverage (VFC) mainly affected the southeastern part, where a significant negative correlation was measured. The human-activity contribution rate was -1.0774 on the Loess Plateau, which means human activities effectively reduced the soil erosion modulus while climate change promoted soil erosion combined with the result of the analysis of variance (ANOVA). "Hilly and gully regions" and "Gully region of Loess Plateau" as the main implementation areas of ecological projects, human activities had contribution rate of 0.5513 and 0.7805 toward the declining of soil erosion, respectively. Interestingly, the spatial differentiation characteristic of the soil erosion driving mechanisms and human contribution rates on the Loess Plateau showed the same boundary line from northeast to southwest, which was well explained by the 400-mm isohyetal line and Hu's Line. This boundary can guide the geographical layout of the ecological management projects and urban development spaces on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Diagnostic precision of sentinel lymph node biopsy in penile cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was designed as a minimally invasive method for evaluation of nodal involvement in patients with penile cancer and nonpalpable lymph nodes. Nevertheless, SLNB is not used in a regular basis due to the lack of studies that adequately characterize the performance of this procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of SLNB in patients with infiltrative penile carcinoma without palpable inguinal lymph nodes in a Colombian population.Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of 89 patients diagnosed with infiltrative penile squamous cell carcinoma with nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes. These patients underwent partial or complete penectomy, along with SLNB, between 2008 and 2017. Those individuals with a positive SLNB underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy, while those with a negative SLNB were followed on a quarterly basis with a physical examination and imaging to assess relapse. Statistical analysis was done using the STATA 14 software. A contingency table was made to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and exactitude, each one with its own confidence interval (CI) of 95%.Results: There was an average follow-up of 31.4 months, and all 89 patients were evaluated; most primary tumors were T2 (55%), followed by T1 (37%), all of which were subclassified as T1b and T3 (8%). Tumours were most frequently located in the glans (43%). All patients were classified as cN0 and underwent SLNB. Sixty-one patients (69%) tested negative in the SLNB, four of whom (6%) presented with lymph node relapse. On the other hand, 28 patients (31%) tested positive in the SLNB and consequently underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy, seven of whom had negative lymph nodeinvolvement (25% false positives). According to the results, the sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 65.3-93.6) and the specificity was 89% (95% CI, 79.4-94.7), with a false-negative rate of 6.5%.Conclusions: The SLNB using radiotracer can be a useful method for lymph node staging in patients with penile cancer and nonpalpable lymph nodes when performed in experienced centers.

TI  - MODIS and PROBA-V NDVI Products Differ when Compared with Observations from Phenological Towers at Four Tropical Dry Forests in the Americas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used to monitor vegetation phenology and productivity around the world. Over the last few decades, phenology monitoring at large scales has been possible due to the information and metrics derived from satellite sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or the Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V). However, due to their temporal and spatial resolution, adequate ground comparison is lacking. In this paper, we analyze how NDVI products from MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and PROBA-V predict vegetation phenology when compared with near-surface observations. We conduct this comparison at four tropical dry forests (TDFs) in the Americas. We undertake this study by comparing the following: (i) Dissimilarities of the standardized NDVI (NDVIS) using dynamic time warping, (ii) the differences of daily NDVIS between seasons and ENSO months using generalized linear models, and (iii) phenometrics derived from NDVI time series. Overall, our results suggest that NDVIS from satellite observations present DTW distances (dissimilarities) between 2.98 and 46.57 (18.91 +/- 12.31) when compared with near-surface observations. Furthermore, NDVIS comparisons reveal that overall differences between satellite and near-surface observations are close to zero, but this tends to differ between seasons or when El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is present. Phenometrics comparisons show that metrics derived from satellite observations such as green-up, maturity, and start and end of the wet season strongly correlate with those from near-surface observations. In contrast, phenometrics that describe the day of the highest or lowest NDVI tend to be inconsistent with those from near-surface observations. All findings were observed independently of the NDVI source. Our results suggest that satellite-based NDVI products tend to be inconsistent descriptors of vegetation events on tropical deciduous forests in comparison with near-surface observations. These results reinforce the idea that satellite-based NDVI products should be used and interpreted with great caution and only in ecosystems with well-established knowledge of their vegetation phenology.

TI  - Head and Neck Cancer Detection in Digitized Whole-Slide Histology Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary management for head and neck cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), involves surgical resection with negative cancer margins. Pathologists guide surgeons during these operations by detecting cancer in histology slides made from the excised tissue. In this study, 381 digitized, histological whole-slide images (WSI) from 156 patients with head and neck cancer were used to train, validate, and test an inception-v4 convolutional neural network. The proposed method is able to detect and localize primary head and neck SCC on WSI with an AUC of 0.916 for patients in the SCC testing group and 0.954 for patients in the thyroid carcinoma testing group. Moreover, the proposed method is able to diagnose WSI with cancer versus normal slides with an AUC of 0.944 and 0.995 for the SCC and thyroid carcinoma testing groups, respectively. For comparison, we tested the proposed, diagnostic method on an open-source dataset of WSI from sentinel lymph nodes with breast cancer metastases, CAMELYON 2016, to obtain patch-based cancer localization and slide-level cancer diagnoses. The experimental design yields a robust method with potential to help create a tool to increase efficiency and accuracy of pathologists detecting head and neck cancers in histological images.

TI  - Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) model coupled with lineament mapping for delineating groundwater potential areas (GPA)
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 21st century, global warming, erratic rainfall and the pressure on groundwater resources are becoming severe and leading to water scarcity, which contributes to the poverty of around one-third of the world's people. Hence, it became necessary to use new geospatial technologies for mapping and monitoring of groundwater resources. Spatial analysis of hydro-geological lineament network and hydrological modeling may allow accurate identification of areas that favor infiltration and recharge of overexploited groundwater. In Morocco, the Middle Atlas region suffers from a lack of reliable hydro-geological maps for local water resource managers. Consequently, this research aims to assess the relative contribution of the topo-hydrological factor, known as Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) for efficient exploration and management of groundwater resources in central Middle Atlas. The methodology was based on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for retrieving the lineaments and the elevation data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for the calculation of the HAND model. Four landscape classes namely, waterlogged land, wetlands sloped, hillslope and plateaus, corresponding to the main hydrological systems, were delineated using the HAND model. In addition, fissured carbonate plateaus, faults, karsts, water sources, lakes and groundwater levels have been used to develop a decision support system based on geospatial criteria analysis. The fracture analysis indicated that the study area has many long and short hydro-geological lineaments, with the highest densities oriented NE-SW. Their synergy with the HAND model and the other factors has allowed the detection of potential areas for the recharge of the groundwater table. The results have been confirmed and validated using lakes, water sources and piezometric levels. The application of the HAND factor as an independent variable in the delineation of groundwater potential areas (GPAs) is demonstrated to be useful for improving the accuracy of the existing multi-criteria GIS models.

TI  - <i>Fengyun-3D</i> MERSI True Color Imagery Developed for Environmental Applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many techniques were developed for creating true color images from satellite solar reflective bands, and the so-derived images have been widely used for environmental monitoring. For the newly launched Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite, the same capability is required for its Medium Resolution Spectrum Imager-II (MERSI-II). In processing the MERSI-II true color image, a more comprehensive processing technique is developed, including the atmospheric correction, nonlinear enhancement, and image splicing. The effect of atmospheric molecular scattering on the total reflectance is corrected by using a parameterized radiative transfer model. A nonlinear stretching of the solar band reflectance is applied for increasing the image contrast. The discontinuity in composing images from multiple orbits and different granules is eliminated through the distance weighted pixel blending (DWPB) method. Through these processing steps, the MERSI-II true color imagery can vividly detect many natural events such as sand and dust storms, snow, algal bloom, fire, and typhoon. Through a comprehensive analysis of the true color imagery, the specific natural disaster events and their magnitudes can be quantified much easily, compared to using the individual channel data.

TI  - Improved Piecewise Linear Transformation for Precise Warping of Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of evenly distributed conjugate points (CPs) in entirely overlapping regions of the images are required to achieve successful co-registration between very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. The CPs are then used to construct a non-linear transformation model that locally warps a sensed image to a reference image's coordinates. Piecewise linear (PL) transformation is largely exploited for warping VHR images because of its superior performance as compared to the other methods. The PL transformation constructs triangular regions on a sensed image from the CPs by applying the Delaunay algorithm, after which the corresponding triangular regions in a reference image are constructed using the same CPs on the image. Each corresponding region in the sensed image is then locally warped to the regions of the reference image through an affine transformation estimated from the CPs on the triangle vertices. The warping performance of the PL transformation shows reliable results, particularly in regions inside the triangles, i.e., within the convex hulls. However, the regions outside the triangles, which are warped when the extrapolated boundary planes are extended using CPs located close to the regions, incur severe geometric distortion. In this study, we propose an effective approach that focuses on the improvement of the warping performance of the PL transformation over the external area of the triangles. Accordingly, the proposed improved piecewise linear (IPL) transformation uses additional pseudo-CPs intentionally extracted from positions on the boundary of the sensed image. The corresponding pseudo-CPs on the reference image are determined by estimating the affine transformation from CPs located close to the pseudo-CPs. The latter are simultaneously used with the former to construct the triangular regions, which are enlarged accordingly. Experiments on both simulated and real datasets, constructed from Worldview-3 and Kompsat-3A satellite images, were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed IPL transformation. That transformation was shown to outperform the existing linear/non-linear transformation models such as an affine, third and fourth polynomials, local weighted mean, and PL. Moreover, we demonstrated that the IPL transformation improved the warping performance over the PL transformation outside the triangular regions by increasing the correlation coefficient values from 0.259 to 0.304, 0.603 to 0.657, and 0.180 to 0.338 in the first, second, and third real datasets, respectively.

TI  - Detecting Winter Wheat Irrigation Signals Using SMAP Gridded Soil Moisture Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern part of the Hebei Province is one of China's major crop-producing regions. Due to the continuous decline in groundwater level, agricultural water use is facing significant challenges. Precision agricultural irrigation management is undoubtedly an effective way to solve this problem. Based on multisource data (time series soil moisture active passive (SMAP) data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET), and meteorological station precipitation), the irrigation signal (frequency, timing and area) is detected in the southern part of the Hebei Province. The SMAP data was processed by the 5-point moving average method to reduce the error caused by the uncertainty of the microwave data derived SM. Irrigation signals can be detected by removing the precipitation effect and setting the SM change threshold. Based on the validation results, the overall accuracy of the irrigation signal detection is 77.08%. Simultaneously, considering the spatial resolution limitation of SMAP pixels, the SMAP irrigation area was downscaled using the winter wheat area extracted from MODIS NDVI. The analytical results of 55 winter wheat samples (5 samples in a group) showed that winter wheat covered by one SMAP pixel had an 82.72% growth consistency in surface water irrigation period, which can indicate a downscaling effectiveness. According to the above statistical analysis, this paper considers that although the spatial resolution of SMAP data is insufficient, it can reflect the change of SM more sensitively. In areas where the crop pattern is relatively uniform, the introduction of high-resolution crop pattern distribution can be used not only to detect irrigation signals but also to validate the effectiveness of irrigation signal detection by analyzing crop growth consistency. Therefore, the downscaling results can indicate the true winter wheat irrigation timing, area and frequency in the study area.

TI  - Geostationary Lightning Mapper Flash Characteristics of Electrified Snowfall Events
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines characteristics of lightning in snowfall events (i.e., thundersnow, TSSN) from the perspective of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) and the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) merged Snowfall Rate (mSFR) product. A thundersnow detection algorithm (TDA) was derived from the GLM and mSFR that resulted in a probability of detection (POD) of 66.7% when compared to the aviation routine weather report (METAR) reports of TSSN. However, using the TDA an additional 2175 lightning flashes within detected snowfall were identified that were not observed by the METAR reports, indicating that TSSN has been under reported in previous literature. TSSN flashes observed by GLM have mean flash areas, durations, and total optical energy outputs of 754 km(2), 402 ms, and 1342 fJ, which are between the 50th and 99th percentile values for all flashes within the GLM field of view. A comparison with data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) indicated that the NLDN had at least one cloud or ground flash detection in 1709 of the 2214 flashes observed by GLM in snowfall. An average of 5.85 NLDN flashes was assigned to a single GLM flash when the NLDN flash data were constrained by the GLM flash duration and spatial footprint. Statistically significant (p < 0.01) differences in flash area and flash energy were found between flashes that were observed by the NLDN and those that were not. Additionally, when GLM was combined with the NLDN, at least 11.1% of flashes involved a tall human-made object like an antenna or wind turbine.

TI  - THE MYTH AND LEGEND OF SADAI AND GASPAR STRAIT BANGKA BELITUNG (BANCA-BILLITON) AND OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sadai strait is located in between of Bangka and Lepar island (Pulo Lepa). Gaspar strait positioned between Bangka and Belitung island was named after the Spanish captain passed through it from Manilla in 1724. Southeast part of Bangka had been called Macclesfield after Captain Hurle in English ship Macclesfield. The myth of many pirates, the legend of many sunken of warship and merchant ships of Chinese, Dutch, Japanese at Gaspar Strait. The southernmost dangered Fairlie Rock was named and discovered by a merchant company ship Fairlie in 1813 and a more detail examination by Captain Ross at surveying ship Discovery in 1814. A Portuguese ship sail from Macao was wrecked in 1816 at Discovery Rock. The study aims to build and analyze the bathymetric, current spatial model and tide data to discover the oceanographic characters related to the sunken ships legends. Measurement based on a hydroacoustic method using single beam echosounder for primary data, GEBCO bathymetric and Landsat-8 satellite for secondary data. GPS coordinate and depth value of x-y-z was processed for a spatial layer using geo-statistical gridding method. A spatial numerical model of current based on data of bathymetry and tide data using the hydrodynamic module to build two and three-dimensional models based on a triangular mesh (system flexible mesh) spatial unit with consideration on the seawater baroclinic condition. Narrow strait and small islands widely distributed around Gaspar strait as a channel of no escape in the case of sailboat piracy. Oceanographic variable mainly caused by extremity and known as the most dangerous `Fairli-and Discovery rock' with narrow and shallow rock bottom morphology especially at low tides and considerable extent of sand-dunes and the north (Natuna island) to south (Bangka-Belitung) seawater volume transport and current pattern interactions seems to be the most dominant and unpredictable situations for ship line safety.

TI  - Mapping Time-Space Brickfield Development Dynamics in Peri-Urban Area of Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the high demand for cheap construction materials, clay-made brick manufacturing has become a thriving industry in Bangladesh, with manufacturing kilns heavily concentrated in the peripheries of larger cities and towns. These manufacturing sites, known as brickfields, operate using centuries-old technologies which expel dust, ash, black smoke and other pollutants into the atmosphere. This in turn impacts the air quality of cities and their surroundings and may also have broader impacts on health, the environment, and potentially contribute to global climate change. Using remotely sensed Landsat imagery, this study identifies brickfield locations and areal expansion between 1990 and 2015 in Dhaka, and employs spatial statistics methods including quadrat analysis and Ripley's K-function to analyze the spatial variation of brickfield locations. Finally, using nearest neighbor distance as density functions, the distance between brickfield locations and six major geographical features (i.e., urban, rural settlement, wetland, river, highway, and local road) were estimated to investigate the threat posed by the presence of such polluting brickfields nearby urban, infrastructures and other natural areas. Results show significant expansion of brickfields both in number and clusters between 1990 and 2015 with brickfields increasing in number from 247 to 917 (total growth rate 271%) across the Dhaka urban center. The results also reveal that brickfield locations are spatially clustered: 78% of brickfields are located on major riverbanks and 40% of the total are located in ecologically sensitive wetlands surrounding Dhaka. Additionally, the average distance from the brick manufacturing plant to the nearest urban area decreased from 1500 m to 500 m over the study period. This research highlights the increasing threats to the environment, human health, and the sustainability of the megacity Dhaka from brickfield expansion in the immediate peripheral areas of its urban center. Findings and methods presented in this study can facilitate data-driven decision making by government officials and city planners to formulate strategies for improved brick production technologies and decreased environmental impacts for this urban region in Bangladesh.

TI  - A spatial model of streaked horned lark breeding habitat in the Columbia River, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The streaked homed lark (hereafter "lark"; Eremophila alpestris strigata) is a federally listed bird subspecies of the Pacific Northwest that occupies open landscapes with short vegetation and abundant bare ground. Across its breeding range, which has contracted dramatically, the lark relies primarily on human-modified habitats maintained in early successional states (e.g., agricultural fields, airfields, deposition islands). The focus of our study is the lower Columbia River where larks primarily occupy deposition islands created as a byproduct of shipping channel deepening (dredging) projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proactively adopted a shifting-habitat-mosaic management approach when placing dredge (sand) materials to maintain lark habitat throughout the project area. To help achieve their goal, we created a geospatial tool capable of quantifying and tracking habitat suitability for larks throughout the project area with satellite imagery. We created spatial models of lark breeding habitat by incorporating lark survey data, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, dredge-deposition maps, and surface-elevation models. We built candidate predictive models of lark breeding habitat after combining survey data (years 2016 and 2017), predictor variables, and logistic regression. In addition, we created a novel seral-stage predictor variable to identify young, mature, old, and unsuitable locations; critical information for lark conservation planning and dredge-disposal operational planning. We challenged probability models the year they were constructed (2016) and the following year (2017) with set-aside survey data. The best model contained terrain ruggedness, deposition age, vegetation greenness (e.g., lushness and density of vegetation) inside a 10-m cell, and heterogeneity in greenness within a 100-m radius. Verification accuracy ranged from 75 to 83% depending on the model tested and year. Importantly, the seral-stage variable allowed us to quantify and locate early, optimal, and late habitats. Model results will facilitate conservation planning decisions by informing real-time management decisions. Furthermore, they provide a foundation for application in other human-modified habitats across the species' range.

TI  - Hepatic Metal and Metallothionein Levels in a Potential Sentinel Teleost, <i>Dules</i><i>auriga</i>, from a Southeastern Brazilian Estuary
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of estuarine sentinel species is of paramount importance. The potential of the species Dules auriga sampled from Guanabara Bay, Brazil regarding metal contamination was assessed. Hepatic metallothionein (MT) and Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cd and Ag concentrations were determined in cytosolic fractions (S50 and HT S50) by polarography and ICP-OES, respectively. HT S50 Fe, Mn and Zn were lower than in the S50 fraction, indicating MT-detoxification. MT was correlated to HT S50 Zn, indicating Zn homeostasis. Zn was negatively correlated to weight (TW) and length (TL), suggesting environmental Zn influence. A moderate negative correlation between HT S50 Cu and the condition factor (CF) was observed, indicating that increasing environmental Cu concentrations may decrease D. auriga CF. Several inter-elemental correlations were observed. No MT, TW and TL correlations were found. Thus, MT variability is probably linked to environmental metal concentrations. D. auriga fulfills most sentinel requisites, and MT may be an adequate metal contamination biomarker in this species.

TI  - Visualization and quantification of anastomotic perfusion in colorectal surgery using near-infrared fluorescence
T2  - TECHNIQUES IN COLOPROCTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Anastomotic leakage (AL) is one of the most troublesome complications in colorectal surgery. Recently, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has been used intraoperatively to detect sentinel lymph nodes and visualize the blood supply at the region of interest (ROI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of visualization and quantification of bowel perfusion around the anastomosis using NIRF system in predicting AL. Methods A prospective study was conducted on patients who had laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer at our institution. Perfusion of the anastomosis was evaluated with NIRF imaging after intravenous injection of indocyanine green (ICG). The time course of fluorescence intensity was recorded by an imaging analyzer We measured the time from ICG injection to the beginning of fluorescence (T-0), maximum intensity (I-max), time to reach I-max (T-max), time to reach I-max 50% (Tmax1/2\documentclass[12pt] and slope (S) after the anastomosis. Results Tumor locations were as follows; cecum: 2, ascending colon: 2, transverse colon: 7, descending colon: 1, sigmoid colon: 2, rectosigmoid colon: 3 and rectum: 6 (one case with synchronous cancer). All operations were performed laparoscopically. Four patients were diagnosed with or suspected to have AL (2 patients with grade B anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection, 1 patient with minor leakage in transverse colon resection and 1 patient needing re-anastomosis intraoperatively in transverse colon resection). T-0 was significantly longer in the AL group than in patients without AL (64.3 +/- 27.6 and 18.2 +/- 6.6 s, p = 2.2 x 10(-3)). Conclusions Perfusion of the anastomosis could be successfully visualized and quantified using NIRF imaging with ICG. T-0 might be a useful parameter for prediction of AL.

TI  - Spatial-Spectral Fusion in Different Swath Widths by a Recurrent Expanding Residual Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of remotely sensed images is usually determined by their spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and coverage. However, due to limitations in the sensor hardware, the spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and swath width of the coverage are mutually constrained. Remote sensing image fusion aims at overcoming the different constraints of remote sensing images, to achieve the purpose of combining the useful information in the different images. However, the traditional spatial-spectral fusion approach is to use data in the same swath width that covers the same area and only considers the mutually constrained conditions between the spectral resolution and spatial resolution. To simultaneously solve the image fusion problems of the swath width, spatial resolution, and spectral resolution, this paper introduces a method with multi-scale feature extraction and residual learning with recurrent expanding. To discuss the sensitivity of convolution operation to different variables of images in different swath widths, we set the sensitivity experiments in the coverage ratio and offset position. We also performed the simulation and real experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework with the Sentinel-2 data, which simulated the different widths.

TI  - Mapping fractional cover of major fuel type components across Alaskan tundra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildland fire is common and widespread in Alaskan tundra. Tundra fires exert considerable influence on local ecosystem functioning and contribute to climate change through biogeochemical (e.g. carbon cycle) and biogeophysical (e.g. albedo) effects. These treeless landscapes are characterized by a high degree of variation in fuel loading at scales much finer than moderate (30 m) satellite observations. However, because of the remoteness of the tundra and its lower contribution to carbon release compared to boreal forests, most frequently tundra fuels are poorly characterized, limiting the effective development of tundra-specific fire occurrence and behavior models. This study presents an approach to mapping the fractional coverages of major fuel type components in Alaskan tundra circa 2015 combining field data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager observations. We adopt a multi-step Random Forest method to estimate the fractional vegetation cover of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel level. We demonstrate the strong capability of exploiting multi-seasonal spectral information to identify these component types, with R-squared values around 0.95 and root mean squared errors below 10% for predicting their fractional cover. Our mapping products depict the spatial distribution of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel resolution across Alaskan tundra, which can function as a critical input for studying wildland fire risk and behavior in the tundra. The distributions of these fuel components align well with climate-based tundra ecoregions although climate variables are not included in our models.

TI  - Complete three-dimensional near-field surface displacements from imaging geodesy techniques applied to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent development of imaging geodesy, an advanced technique with a high spatial resolution and large-scale coverage, has enabled researchers to obtain multiple high-quality surface displacement estimates at low labor-cost, thereby improving the capability to monitor and manage geological disasters. The different sources (e.g., radar, optical and LiDAR sensors) and analysis approaches (e.g., differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar, DInSAR; multiple-aperture InSAR; pixel offset tracking; and iterative closest point, ICP) in imaging geodesy used to derive displacement estimates have unique benefits and drawbacks. However, the inherent differences among these data sources and methods in the construction of three-dimensional (3D) deformation maps, particularly in the near field, remain poorly understood and require further discussion. In this study, we acquired three pairs of ALOS-2 stripmap mode images, two pairs of Sentinel-1 TOPS mode images and pre- and post-event LiDAR data for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake to explore the 3D near-field displacements using various imaging geodesy techniques with different types of image information, i.e., SAR phase data, SAR amplitude data and LiDAR point cloud data. Our results show that each image type is independently capable of producing a high-quality 3D deformation map for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake with an on-fault accuracy of <43 cm determined from field work measurement, and an off-fault accuracy of <14 cm determined from GNSS observations. The major contributors to the uncertainty in the 3D deformation estimates from the SAR phase, SAR amplitude, and LiDAR data methods are the effective Doppler bandwidth, pixel resolution and topographic roughness, respectively. In the near-field deformation region, more secondary fault ruptures were revealed by SAR amplitude and LiDAR information than by the SAR phase information, thereby overcoming the sensitivity of the SAR phase signal to incoherence. Finally, an integrated complete 3D map was generated to constrain the coseismic rupture behavior of the Kumamoto earthquake sequence associated with the Futagawa and Hinagu faults. Our slip model suggests the main slip rupture a length of 32 km and terminated near the rim of the Aso caldera; additionally, the slip pattern delineated by three asperities that was dominated by right-lateral strike-slip with a minor normal slip component at a depth of 7 km. Furthermore, the main rupture triggered two secondary faults with right-lateral strike-slip and normal slip. Our source model yields a geodetic moment of 5.77 X 10(19) N.m, which corresponds to Mw 7.11.

TI  - Wetland Classification Based on a New Efficient Generative Adversarial Network and Jilin-1 Satellite Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown that deep learning methods provide useful tools for wetland classification. However, it is difficult to perform species-level classification with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method for wetland species classification by using a new efficient generative adversarial network (GAN) and Jilin-1 satellite image. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the proposed method, namely ShuffleGAN, requires only a small number of labeled samples. ShuffleGAN is composed of two neural networks (i.e., generator and discriminator), which perform an adversarial game in the training phase and ShuffleNet units are added in both generator and discriminator to obtain speed-accuracy tradeoff. Second, ShuffleGAN can perform species-level wetland classification. In addition to distinguishing the wetland areas from non-wetlands, different tree species located in the wetland are also identified, thus providing a more detailed distribution of the wetland land-covers. Experiments are conducted on the Haizhu Lake wetland data acquired by the Jilin-1 satellite. Compared with existing GAN, the improvement in overall accuracy (OA) of the proposed ShuffleGAN is more than 2%. This work can not only deepen the application of deep learning in wetland classification but also promote the study of fine classification of wetland land-covers.

TI  - Multiscale habitat mediates pest reduction by birds in an intensive agricultural region
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat augmentation on farms is predicted to conserve biological diversity and support beneficial animals that reduce crop pests. Effectiveness of local habitat enhancement and subsequent pest reduction services can be mediated by the amount of habitat at larger scales. We tested whether the presence and increase of local and landscape scale bird habitat increased avian predator abundance and pest reduction by birds. We surveyed birds and performed a sentinel prey exclosure experiment in walnut orchards in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA-comparing predation probability between orchards with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) woody habitat in uncultivated orchard margins. We digitized seminatural habitat cover in landscapes around orchards to test the effectiveness of avian predators in reducing sentinel prey along a seminatural cover gradient of 0-38%. Experimental prey were diapausing larvae of Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae; codling moth), a significant pest of walnuts, which overwinter in cocoons in orchards, emerge as adults, and produce larvae that feed on the nuts the following spring. Permitting bird access to cocoons increased larval predation from 11% (caged) to 46% (no cage), and predation increased with increasing proportions of seminatural habitat within 500-m of orchard transects. Predation also increased as the size and bark furrow depth of walnut trees increased, likely because these characteristics were associated with increasing abundance of avian predators with functional traits specific to consuming tree-dwelling cocoons (e.g., woodpeckers). The presence and increasing complexity of local margin habitat increased the species richness and abundance of avian predators but was not predictive of cocoon predation. Consistent with intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis predictions, the effect size of woodpecker abundance on predation was large in simple landscapes (1-20% seminatural cover) and low in complex landscapes (>20% cover). Contrary to predictions, effect size was large in cleared landscapes (<1% cover), suggesting that orchards supported predators in cleared landscapes, with positive effects on pest reduction. We provide evidence that increasing the abundance of avian predators with traits specific for consuming target pests-by retaining old trees and seminatural cover-can increase orchard pest reduction services in an intensive agricultural region.

TI  - Evaluation of the MODIS collections 5 and 6 for change analysis of vegetation and land surface temperature dynamics in North and South America
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest collection (C6) of MODIS data provides several algorithmic improvements and calibration adjustments that correct for sensor degradation, theoretically making the C6 MODIS products more accurate compared to previous collections. C6 adjustments also introduce several improvements in the vegetation index (VI) retrieval algorithms. With these improvements, we expect only minor differences between data from Terra and Aqua, but significantly different results between C5 and C6. In this paper, we investigate three different MODIS products to determine the extent that improvements made to C6 influence the overall trend results for time series between 2001 and 2017. We focus on these three products specifically, both to allow for a comparison of vegetation index products-NDVI and EVI from MOD13C1, and NDVI and EVI calculated based on surface reflectance from MCD43C4-and also to gain an understanding of the improvements on an entirely different product from the same sensor, namely Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MOD11C2. For the MCD43C4 dataset, we find that 17.9% and 16.4% of EVI and NDVI pixels, respectively, display trend discordance between C5 and C6. For the MOD13C1 vegetation indices, we found comparable rates of trend discordance between C5 and C6: 18.5% and 17.4% for the EVI and NDVI pixels, respectively. For both products the greatest changes between C5 and C6 are an overall increase in pixels exhibiting a significant greening trend and an overall decline in pixels exhibiting a significant browning trend. Moreover, the largest differences between C5 and C6 for the NDVI and EVI data appear in cropland areas and in regions with relatively little human influence. In the Land Surface Temperature product (MOD11C2), the discordance between C5 and C6 is much lower: only 3.2% of day and 5.0% of night LST trends exhibited discordance between C5 and C6. We analyze the complementary results of vegetation index and land surface temperature trends and demonstrate that combining the results from different products observed at different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum-but linked through the biogeophysical processes of surface energy balance-allows us to portray change with more confidence than when relying on vegetation index data alone.

TI  - Mapping Geospatial Processes Affecting the Environmental Fate of Agricultural Pesticides in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of agricultural pesticides in Africa can have negative effects on human health and the environment. The aim of this study was to identify African environments that are vulnerable to the accumulation of pesticides by mapping geospatial processes affecting pesticide fate. The study modelled processes associated with the environmental fate of agricultural pesticides using publicly available geospatial datasets. Key geospatial processes affecting the environmental fate of agricultural pesticides were selected after a review of pesticide fate models and maps for leaching, surface runoff, sedimentation, soil storage and filtering capacity, and volatilization were created. The potential and limitations of these maps are discussed. We then compiled a database of studies that measured pesticide residues in Africa. The database contains 10,076 observations, but only a limited number of observations remained when a standard dataset for one compound was extracted for validation. Despite the need for more in-situ data on pesticide residues and application, this study provides a first spatial overview of key processes affecting pesticide fate that can be used to identify areas potentially vulnerable to pesticide accumulation.

TI  - Mapping Activities in Recreational Trail With Spatial Video: A Case Study in Kent State University
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOSPATIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the usage patterns of a trail in a university environment is crucial for assessing the functionality of the trail and evaluating its impact to health in college students. This article presents a novel approach to map the usage patterns of a university trail by employing spatial video in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Physical activities in the southeast part of the main campus of Kent State University (Kent, Ohio), were filmed by a GPS-enabled camera unit. The observed physical activities at the time of filming were coded from the videos and visualized as maps. The study finds that activities tend to concentrate near the center of campus, the farther from the campus, the fewer number of activities. The usage patterns are different between men and women. The activity zones of men are more dispersed, while those of women are more concentrated near campus center.

CP  - 10th South China Sea Tsunami Workshop (SCSTW)

AB  - Tsunami is one of the world's most dangerous marine disaster. In this paper, freely available remote sensing data are applied to study the hazard, vulnerability, and evacuation in the event that a tsunami strikes the district of Tianya in the city of Sanya. Tsunami inundation is calculated using a tsunami numerical model, and the tsunami vulnerability and evacuation in the inundation area are analyzed. Aster Global Digital Elevation Model elevation data are applied to provide input data for the tsunami numerical model and thus obtain tsunami inundation areas, while they are also used to study the surface slope for evacuation. Landsat satellite imagery is used to analyze land-water borders and land cover in both hazard assessment and evacuation analysis. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite nighttime lights data provide information of the socioeconomic activity for vulnerability analysis. The analysis results show that the remote sensing data is suitable for tsunami assessment and evacuation analysis of China's county-level region. We can get a general understanding about tsunami vulnerability and evacuation situation. One kind of remote sensing data can accomplish several tasks, avoiding the error caused by different source data. Remote sensing can play an important role in tsunami assessment.

TI  - Inter-annual variability in fine particulate matter pollution over China during 2013-2018: Role of meteorology
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the long-term observed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) data obtained from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, the present study focused on the analysis of annual and seasonal trends of PM2.5 over the polluted areas in China from 2013 to 2018. The MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data was used as an auxiliary data to supplement the analysis with surface measured PM2.5. The emission source inventory and meteorology datasets are also used and analyzed to examine the causes of changes in trends of PM2.5. The results revealed that the annually averaged values of AOD and surface PM2.5 concentrations over the high-polluted areas are decreasing year-by-year, with stable values found over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The decreasing trends of PM2.5 concentration and fine particle pollution frequency over the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) area are most obvious. Over the PRD region, PM2.5 concentration maintains below the annual air quality standard (35 mu g/m(3)) with low fine particle pollution frequency. The decreasing trend of averaged PM2.5 in each region is closely related to the reduction of anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions. However, the fluctuated features in different season are mostly influenced by the meteorological conditions. Based on the weather type classifications observed from the COST733 model, the weather types under uniform pressure and eastern high pressure more likely resulted in the occurrence of fine particulate pollution over China. When the weather under the bottom with high pressure occurs, Northeast China (NEC) and BTH regions are most likely to be polluted, which is more likely to lead to heavy fine particle pollution events. The air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area is the most serious when the uniform pressure field weather occurs in winter.

TI  - Differences between pure desmoplastic melanoma and superficial spreading melanoma in terms of survival, distribution and other clinicopathologic features
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pure desmoplastic melanoma (pDM) is an uncommon subtype of malignant melanoma with comparative high rates of local recurrence and low rates of sentinel lymph node positivity. The melanoma-specific survival (MSS) of pDM compared to other melanoma subtypes is unclear, with conflicting reports and lack of multivariable analyses. Objectives We aimed to describe clinicopathological characteristics of a cohort of patients with pDM and to compare the MSS of pDM with superficial spreading melanoma (SSM). Methods A prospective cohort study was performed of all primary invasive cutaneous pDM with known tumour location and thickness reviewed at a tertiary referral centre over 21 years. Results A total of 119 primary cutaneous invasive pDMs from 3570 total invasive cutaneous melanomas were included. Compared to 2272 SSMs, and due largely to their greater average thickness, patients with pDM had worse MSS (unadjusted hazard ratio, HR, 2.56, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.56-4.22). After adjustment for clinicopathologic factors (including thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, age and sex), there was evidence that patients with pDM had an improved MSS (adjusted HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.87). Median thickness of head and neck pDM was greater than non-head and neck pDM (P < 0.001). There was reduced univariable MSS in head and neck pDM compared to the rest of the body. Conclusions Decreased univariable MSS of patients with pDM compared to SSM was explained by the increased frequency of adverse clinicopathologic features at diagnosis, in particular the greater Breslow thickness of pDM. After adjustment, patients with pDM had half the chance of melanoma-specific death compared to SSM. Head and neck pDM were thicker at diagnosis compared to the rest of the body, which may account for its poorer survival compared to the rest of the body.

TI  - A metabolic scaling theory-driven remote sensing approach to map spatiotemporal dynamics of litterfall in a tropical montane cloud forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Litter production, or litterfall, is a predominant part of the carbon and nutrient cycles of forest ecosystems. As a major and relatively invariable aspect of primary production, litterfall could be a predictor of total plant production. However, the conventional field approach for its estimation is laborious and costly. High temporal resolution optical satellite imagery may strengthen our ability to estimate litterfall over a vast region, but this remote sensing method is limited in some tropical and near-tropical mountainous regions, mainly due to coarse spatial resolution and frequent cloud coverage. The metabolic scaling theory (MST) states that forest productivity (including litterfall) is directly proportional to the mass of the photosynthesis tissue (leaves), and spatially, it may be isometrically scaled using the size of the largest individual in the system. In this study, we investigated the temporal dimension of the MST and hypothesized that the maximum leaf abundance over a year could also be a key determinant of annual litter production. The relationship between the leaf mass during the peak growing season and annual litterfall could facilitate large-scale litterfall mapping in mountainous terrains, since vegetation indices such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), commonly utilized as a surrogate for leaf abundance, can be derived from relatively high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We correlated the summer growing season Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) EVI and NDVI for 2016 and 2017 and the temporally corresponding annual accumulated field litterfall data acquired from hinoki (Chamaecyparis spp.) dominant tropical montane cloud forests in northeastern Taiwan (23.98 N, 120.97 E). We found that the summer growing season EVI and NDVI may be salient variables to explain the spatial variation of annual litter production (r(2) = 0.39-0.67, p <= 0.01). The results have profound implications for applying MST to the regional mapping of ecosystem production across space and time in humid tropical regions, and these implications may facilitate the remote assessment of the terrestrial carbon budget.

TI  - Land subsidence in Beijing and its relationship with geological faults revealed by Sentinel-1 InSAR observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing, the capital city of China, has been affected by land subsidence due to intensive groundwater extraction since 1935. Recent studies reported that the maximum subsidence occurred in the east of Beijing, reaching more than 11 cm/year till 2017. To investigate the subsidence (2015(similar to)2017) in Beijing, in this paper, time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) analysis was performed with 22 Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode SAR data. Results show that wide areas in the east of Beijing are subsiding with a maximum rate of 14 cm/year, which is consistent with GPS data. Detailed analysis of the obtained subsidence map reveals the existence of several characteristic near-linear boundaries within the subsiding areas. As a result of our previous three-year project, we generated the exact location, direction, and late Quaternary activity of the main potential active faults in the Beijing area. The relationship between the trace of these existing geological faults and the mentioned subsidence boundaries was investigated in detail. It is suggested that land subsidence in Beijing was mainly caused by the over-extraction of groundwater, with its spatial pattern being controlled by geological faults.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes in ecosystem service value in response to land-use/cover changes in the Pearl River Delta
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development and human activities threaten ecosystem structures and ecological processes. Since 1995, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) has increased by more than thirteen fold. However, our understanding of how the ecosystem service value (ESV) has responded to land-use/cover changes (LUCC) in the PRD remains limited. In this paper, we use a multi-source data approach to assess the patterns of ESV in the PRD from 1995 to 2015. The hot/cool-spot mapping method is used to analyse the spatial differences in ESV at a 1 km scale. The results revealed the following: (a) the proportion of increase in built-up land area is 6.3% in the PRD; this change occurred mainly through the occupation of farmland and forest land. (b) The area of hot spots increased from 37% in 1995 to 41% in 2015, while the area of cool spots increased from 34.6% to 36.3%. The ESV hot spots are mainly distributed in Zhaoqing and Huizhou. (c) The ESV has changed due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors in the PRD. Furthermore, corresponding management measures are identified according to the results of the exploratory spatial data analysis. The findings of this study have practical significance for establishing mathematical models to reveal the patterns of ESV in urban agglomerations.

TI  - Influence of emissivity angular variation on land surface temperature retrieved using the generalized split-window algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The angular variation of land surface emissivity (LSE) is rarely considered in the split-window algorithm for retrieving land surface temperature (LST), and this can cause large uncertainties in LST retrievals. To analyze the influence of angular LSE variation on LST retrievals, we built a look-up table (LUT) of directional emissivities from the MYD21A1 LST/LSE product in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) split-window channels. The extracted directional emissivities were then input into the MODIS generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm to substitute for the classification-based emissivities. A simulation analysis was first conducted based on the LUT. Furthermore, the LST retrievals estimated from MODIS observations using the directional emissivities were compared with those estimated using the classification-based emissivities. In-situ measurements from the US SURFRAD and China's HiWATER networks were used to evaluate LST retrievals obtained using the two different emissivities. The results showed that angular LSE variations in the split-window channels for vegetated surfaces were generally minor during the daytime, but more pronounced during the night-time (approximately 0.005 between nadir and 60 degrees). For barren surfaces, the angular LSE variation in the (similar to)12 mu m channel was negligible but reached approximately 0.01 in the (similar to)11 mu m channel. In the simulation, the influence of angular LSE variation was minor for view-zenith angles (VZA) < 40 degrees, but pronounced for VZA > 40 degrees reaching approximately 1.0 and 0.7 K at VZA 65 degrees for barren and vegetated surfaces, respectively. In the evaluation, the LST estimated using the directional emissivities showed a higher accuracy than those estimated using the classification-based emissivities, especially over barren surfaces where the improvement reached > 1 K. We conclude that angular LSE variation cannot be ignored in LST estimation using the GSW algorithm when VZA is > 40 degrees, especially over barren surfaces. The accuracy of the GSW algorithm is improved pronouncedly by using the directional emissivities extracted from the MYD21 product.

TI  - Tidal-driven variation of suspended sediment in Hangzhou Bay based on GOCI data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in coastal waters plays a key role in the marine physical and chemical processes. Hangzhou Bay is a macrotidal estuary in eastern China. Under the influence of trapped tides, the SSC of Hangzhou Bay responds significantly commensurate with tidal frequencies, which leads to considerable changes in the ocean physical and chemical regimes, such as the underwater light field and turbidity front. However, polar-orbiting imaging satellites are unable to monitor the rapid variation of the SSC due to insufficient temporal resolution. In this study, we used the Geostatlonary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI) data and in situ data of Hangzhou Bay to develop an appropriate remote sensing model to quantify the SSC of Hangzhou Bay and analyzed the impact of tides on the SSC. The research revealed the following findings: (1) The exponential model based on B8/B6 is best suited to remotely estimating the SSC in Hangzhou Bay, and the Mean Relative Error (MRE) is only 15.21%, (2) the variation of SSC in Hangzhou Bay is related to tidal forcing, especially during the ebb tide and the middle of the rising tide, (3) The effect of tidal driven SSC changes is less than the effect of diurnal tidal level variation of the middle tide day and the spring tide day tidal type, and (4) The maximum variation of SSC under tidal forcing is in the coastal ocean near the south bank of Hangzhou Bay and Nanhui Spit, while the origin of the variation of the Zhapu deep trough and the northern estuary is not obvious, which is speculated to be mainly related to the terrain and runoff of Hangzhou Bay. Furthermore, this study established a new model to map SSC in turbid seas and contributes to our understanding of SSC variation in the Hangzhou Bay, driven by strong tidal dynamics.

TI  - Validation and application of water levels derived from Sentinel-3A for the Brahmaputra River
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time ever, this study aims at applying Sentinel-3A to the Great Brahmaputra River (GBR) and validating water levels derived from this newly-launched altimetry satellite mission. The GBR is divided into three primary parts: (1) a large section of the Yarlung Zangbo River in China, also termed the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) in this study, featured by high elevation, complex terrain, narrow river widths (from less than 100 to 400 m), and limited in situ measurements; (2) the Middle Brahmaputra River (MBR) with widths varying from similar to 400 m to similar to 1 km; (3) the Lower Brahmaputra River (LBR), dominated by braided channels with wide river channels (up to several kilometers). For the altimetry data, both waveform retracking and hooking effect correction were applied to mitigate the influence caused by land contamination and to improve the accuracy of water level retrievals. Water levels were derived from 41 virtual stations (VSs) across the GBR and different retracking algorithms were compared with in situ data from two gauging stations in the UBR. Time series of altimetry-based water levels were categorized into three types based on the quality: no data (type 1), degraded (type 2), and good (type 3). Results showed that the VSs (type 1) only existed in the mountainous regions, accounting for similar to a half of the total in the UBR. Validation with the gauged water levels showed that the TIC algorithm performed best among all of the retrackers applied, followed by the Ice-1 algorithm. The standard deviation of the difference between the gauged and TIC-derived water levels ranged from 0.41 to 0.76 m among four different VSs (type 3). In addition, the quality of VSs in the LBR was best, followed by the MBR. Our study has demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-3A in monitoring water levels in the GBR, thereby paving the way for future applications such as discharge estimation and hydrologic/hydrodynamic applications.

TI  - Analysis on the Live Coral Cover around Weizhou Island Using MODIS Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are important as they can help to maintain ecological balance, biological resources, and species diversity on earth. However, they are globally threatened by human activities and climate change. As live coral cover (LCC) is regarded as an important measure of the health of coral reefs, analysis on LCC change associated with environmental parameters, such as chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), sea surface temperature (SST), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), is of great value. Research on this front would help us comprehend the changes in coral reefs induced by human activities and global changes. Instead of using spasmodically in-field-measured environmental parameters, in this study, we chose to combine the successive Chl-a, SST, and PAR products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with historic LCC records to establish an empirical relationship using nonlinear optimization. Thereafter, the established relationship was further used to discuss some possible developments of LCCs. According to the experiments, we concluded that the degradation of the LCC around Weizhou Island may be mainly caused by human-activity-caused eutrophication. Besides, we also showed that even if the Chl-a and the PAR can keep constant with current average levels, the corals around Weizhou Island may still be in a risk of disappearing between 2120-2140 as the SST continues to rise.

TI  - Improvements of the spatially distributed hydrological modelling using the HBV model at 1 km resolution for Norway
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A robust hydrological modeling at a fine spatial resolution is a vital tool for Norway to simulate river discharges and hydrological components for climate adaptation strategies. However, it requires improvements of modelling methods, detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources. This work aims to set up a distributed version of the HBV model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland Norway and to calibrate/validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations. The Penman-Monteith equation was implemented in the HBV model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the Norwegian forest inventory combined with multi-source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution. The estimated potential evapotranspiration (Ep) was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) products, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model. There are 5 climatic zones in Norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices. For each zone, the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi-objective function including the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and biases of selected catchments. In total, there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation. The Ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements, GLEAM and VIC outputs. However, the MOD16 product significantly overestimates Ep compared to the other products. The discharge was well reproduced with the median daily NSE of 0.68/0.67, bias of -3%/ -1%, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.70/0.69 and monthly NSE of 0.80/0.78 in the calibration/validation periods. Our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous HBV application for all catchments, with an increase of 0.08-0.16 in the median values of the daily NSE, KGE and monthly NSE. Both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application.

TI  - Understanding the spatiotemporal development of human settlement in hurricane-prone areas on the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts using nighttime remote sensing
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes, as one of the most devastating natural hazards, have posed a great threat to people in coastal areas. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of human settlement in hurricane-prone areas largely benefits sustainable development. This study uses the nighttime light (NIL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) to examine human settlement development in areas with different levels of hurricane proneness from 1992 to 2013. The DMSP/OLS NIT data from six satellites were intercalibrated and desaturated with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical imagery to derive the Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI), a popular index that quantifies human settlement intensity. The derived VANUI time series was examined with the Mann- Kendall test and Theil-Sen test to identify significant spatiotemporal trends. To link the VANUI product to hurricane impacts, four hurricane-prone zones were extracted to represent different levels of hurricane proneness. Aside from geographic division, a wind-speed-weighted track density function was developed and applied to historical storm tracks which originated in the North Atlantic Basin to better categorize the four levels of hurricane proneness. Spatiotemporal patterns of human settlement in the four zones were finally analyzed. The results clearly exhibit a north-south and inland-coastal discrepancy of human settlement dynamics. This study also reveals that both the zonal extent and zonal increase rate of human settlement positively correlate with hurricane proneness levels. The intensified human settlement in high hurricane-exposure zones deserves further attention for coastal resilience.

TI  - Evaluation of TsHARP Utility for Thermal Sharpening of Sentinel-3 Satellite Images Using Sentinel-2 Visual Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatially distributed land surface temperature is important for many studies. The recent launch of the Sentinel satellite programs paves the way for an abundance of opportunities for both large area and long-term investigations. However, the spatial resolution of Sentinel-3 thermal images is not suitable for monitoring small fragmented fields. Thermal sharpening is one of the primary methods used to obtain thermal images at finer spatial resolution at a daily revisit time. In the current study, the utility of the TsHARP method to sharpen the low resolution of Sentinel-3 thermal data was examined using Sentinel-2 visible-near infrared imagery. Compared to Landsat 8 fine thermal images, the sharpening resulted in mean absolute errors of 1 degrees C, with errors increasing as the difference between the native and the target resolutions increases. Part of the error is attributed to the discrepancy between the thermal images acquired by the two platforms. Further research is due to test additional sites and conditions, and potentially additional sharpening methods, applied to the Sentinel platforms.

TI  - Rangeland vegetation dynamics in the Altai mountain region of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan and China: effects of climate, topography, and socio-political context for livestock herding practices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Discriminating between climate- and human-induced variation in rangeland quality poses a major challenge for developing policy to sustain herder livelihoods and alleviate herder poverty. We contrasted changes in rangeland vegetation cover across a region-the Altai Mountains of central Asia (China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia)-that juxtaposes strongly contrasting social, political and economic conditions across a community of herders of shared cultural background (all of Kazakh origin). Our analysis focused on a satellite-derived vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor during the period 1982-2013, which included the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990 and heralded a transition away from pervasive state control on herding practices in many parts of the region. Grassland cover increased with decreasing elevation and increasing precipitation. Grassland also decreased under increased livestock density but was largely unresponsive to the dramatic changes that occurred in the sociopolitical context for grazing practices. Average NDVI values and duration of growing season were greater after the Soviet Union's collapse across the region, trends that precipitation and temperature data indicate were most likely driven by a changing climate. We conclude that rangeland policy development to assure sustainability of herder livelihoods in the Altai Mountain region should focus on climate change adaptation measures rather than modifying herders' grazing practices.

TI  - A Novel Multispectral, Panchromatic and SAR Data Fusion for Land Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor data fusion is addressed in this article for land classification purposes in a semiarid environment. A novel algorithm based on multispectral, panchromatic and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is here presented. The proposed multisensory data fusion approach relies on the generalized intensity-hue-saturation (G-IHS) transform and the A trous wavelet transform (ATWT). The fusion product is obtained by modulating the high features details of the panchromatic ATWT with the SAR texture and by replacing the high-pass details of the G-IHS Intensity component with this panchromatic-SAR modulation. After the fusion product is derived, a classification is performed by using a standard maximum likelihood classifier. The proposed algorithm is tested over a meaningful case study acquired over the Maspalomas Special Natural Reserve (Spain) and processing data from WorldView-2 (for both multispectral and panchromatic channels) and TerraSAR-X (for the SAR channel) missions. Results show a fine preservation of the spectral information contained in each multispectral band. Sharpened details are observed over built-up areas and a smoothing texture is perceived over homogeneous areas (lakes, sea, bare soil, and roads) due to the SAR-panchromatic modulation. This leads to a better overall classification accuracy of the fused image compared to outcomes obtained with a single sensor, resulting 7% and 2% more accurate than multispectral and pan-sharpening classification, respectively.

AB  - Public opinion on the application of nuclear technology and radiation could change when a nuclear related event occurs. Japan Atomic Energy Relations Organization has tracked its variation through a nationwide opinion survey in Japan by almost the same way every year since FY 2006. We can identify a continuous long-term fluctuation of Japanese opinion before and after the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster using the data. In this study we focused on the trends of public opinion for nuclear energy, impressions and knowledge on radiation, and zero-risk request. For example, radiation can be recognised that it is dangerous and complicated matter by Japanese public regardless of that accident. However, a big change of opinions on radiation was shown on the impression for the word of 'Useful' between before and after the accident.

AB  - The main factor is the orientation to truth, as an absolutely or relatively stable concept in the worldview of man and scientific theory. However, at the slightest shift of this sphere towards the science-intensive or at its transition to a different level of functioning, this specialist will not be able to quickly change his professional and social function. Thus, the authors offer the other concept of the educational paradigm, aimed at comprehension of educational disciplines - general and professional through their truth, and highlighting not only their specific features but their general significance in the system of sciences and worldview of modern man. Modern pedagogy can use this approach in education as an alternative.

TI  - Axillary Pathologic Complete Response in Inflammatory Breast Cancer Patients: Implications for SLNB?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is increasingly utilized after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in responsive adenopathy, particularly with placement of a marking clip in the involved node(s). This may allow a subset of patients to avoid axillary lymph node dissection. SLNB is still discouraged in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The purpose of this study is to examine the axillary pathologic complete response (AXpCR) in IBC patients with clinical adenopathy. There may be an implication to approach a subset of IBC patients for SLNB after NAC. Methods A single-institution institutional review board-approved database was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were clinicopathologic diagnosis of IBC and age >= 18 years. Stage IV disease was excluded. We collected data on demographics, tumor characteristics including histology and subtype, axillary status, and treatment effect details. Results Sixty-six patients fulfilled criteria. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. The AXpCR was 6% for luminal A and luminal B [human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 -] subtypes, and 24% for basal subtype. The AXpCR rate was 64% for HER2-enriched and luminal B (HER2 +) patients. Achievement of AXpCR among these HER2-positive patients was statistically significant (p = 0.0001). There was minimal difference in achieving AXpCR in HER2-overexpressing patients regardless of hormone receptor status (p = 1.000). Conclusions Understanding the best patients to select for use of SLNB or targeted lymph node dissection after treatment is evolving. This unique series identified and described the axillary pathologic characteristics of IBC patients following NAC. Further research is needed to confirm that the approach, axillary node clip placement prior to treatment, is feasible and accurate in IBC.

TI  - Mapping the hepatitis C cascade of care in people attending drug treatment services in England: A data linkage study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Hepatitis C (HCV) infection in England primarily affects people who inject drugs (PWID). We describe persons HCV tested, estimate incidence and establish the cascade of care (CoC) for people engaging with drug services.Methods: Persons testing for HCV in drug services in Sentinel Surveillance of Blood Borne Virus Testing (SSBBV) between 2008 and 2016 were linked with people attending drug services in the National Drug and Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS). We describe risk characteristics, establish the CoC, and estimate HCV incidence in PWID diagnosed in drug services.Results: Of 46,721 persons tested for anti-HCV in SSBBV in drug services, 29,773 (63.7%) linked to NDTMS. Of these, 9100 (30.6%) were antiV positive and anti-HCV positivity was 45.0% in persons reporting urgent housing problems and 43.8% in persons reporting ever injecting. Among persons anti-HCV positive, half had 1 positive anti-HCV test. For persons' first anti-HCV positive between 2008 and 2013 (n = 3123), 74.9% were HCV RNA tested, of whom 71.2% were RNA positive, and of these, 14.0% had evidence of interferon-based treatment, with 52.8% achieving cure. Among PWID, HCV incidence was 8.7 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 8.1-9.2).Conclusion: Through record linkage of surveillance datasets, we estimated the HCV CoC for people attending drug services, providing a benchmark from which to monitor the impact of strategies to scale-up prevention, testing, and curative treatment with direct acting antivirals. Our study highlights wasteful repeated testing and poor linkage to care for this high risk population which need to be addressed.

TI  - Imaging of the Mouse Lymphatic Sinus during Early Stage Lymph Node Metastasis Using Intranodal Lymphangiography with X-ray Micro-computed Tomography
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lymph node (LN) metastasis is detected prior to distant metastasis in many types of cancer. Detecting early stage LN metastasis can improve treatment outcomes. However, there are few clinical imaging modalities capable of diagnosing metastatic LNs of clinical N0 status (i.e., before their volume increases) with high precision. Here, we report a new method for diagnosing metastatic LNs of clinical N0 status in a mouse model of LN metastasis. Procedures The method involved using intranodal lymphangiography with x-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Contrast agent was injected into an upstream LN to deliver it to a downstream LN, which was then removed and analyzed by micro-CT. Results We found that using an intranodal injection rate of 10-60 mu l/min filled the lymphatic sinus of the downstream LN with contrast agent, although the accumulation of contrast agent in the upstream LN increased with a faster injection rate. Furthermore, breast cancer cells growing in the lymphatic sinus of the downstream LN (which was of clinical N0 status) impeded the flow of contrast agent from the upstream LN, resulting in areas deficient of contrast agent in the metastatic downstream LN. The formation of defect areas in the downstream LN manifested as a difference in position between the centroid of the entire LN area and the centroid of the region that filled with contrast agent. Conclusion The present study indicates that intranodal lymphangiography with micro-CT has the potential to be used as a new method for diagnosing metastatic LNs of clinical N0 status.

TI  - Unpacking the relationship between religiosity and conspiracy beliefs in Australia
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the interrelation between religiosity, anti-intellectualism, and political mistrust in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. Improving on previous psychological research on the link between religiosity and societal and political attitudes, we assessed the predictive power of religious self-categorization and the importance attached to one's own (non)religious worldview predicting belief in conspiracy theories separately. Applying quota sampling in a study in Australia (N = 515), the sample consisted of 48.9% believers (i.e., those who self-categorized as religious persons) and 51.1% non-believers (i.e., those who self-categorized as non-religious persons). The results showed that believers and non-believers did not differ in the belief in conspiracy theories. Unpacking this further though, we did find that the extent to which religious worldviews were endorsed predicted belief in conspiracy theories. Among believers, the importance attached to their religious worldview was directly associated with higher belief in conspiracy theories and this link was partly mediated by higher anti-intellectualism. Political trust, in turn, served as an inhibitor of the link between religiosity and conspiracy beliefs. Among non-believers, there was no direct association between the importance of non-religious worldview and belief in conspiracy theories. However, we found that higher trust in political institutions accounted for the negative association between non-religious worldview and lower belief in conspiracy theories. The results underline the importance of distinguishing religiosity as a self-categorization and religiosity as a worldview. We find that it is not the self-categorization as religious, but the extent to which religious worldviews are endorsed that could predict people's beliefs in conspiracy theories.

TI  - Modeling and mapping of climatic classification of Pakistan by using remote sensing climate compound index (2000 to 2018)
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The entire world is collectively facing the problem of climate change. The deterioration of the earth's climate change is being noticed and felt most apparently in Southeast Asia and predominantly in Pakistan. Pakistan is a victim of climate change, due to which Pakistan faces several geographical, political, economic and even social problems. The harmful impacts of climate change in the form of smog and abnormal heat waves have claimed the life of many Pakistanis. Climate change has brought disastrous impact on the agrarian economy of Pakistan, which has plunged the country into awful straits. Climatic change is a slow and continuous process. It is needed that climatic changes in an area should be traced out in time to face upcoming climatic challenges. Present research work has traced out such changes and introduced a new climatic classification scheme for the climate of Pakistan, by using remote sensing (RS) and a new climatic compound index that is RSCCI gives a calculated value, which is used to describe the state and the changes in the climatic system of an area. RSCCI is the combination of different indices. On the basis of RSCCI, a climatic index, spatiotemporal investigation is conducted to measure aridity, humidity and semi-aridity all over Pakistan. In order to find out the extent of these climatic conditions, three MODIS dataset images of 250 m resolution were acquired. RS applications are used effectively to assess the changing climatic trends for the period of eighteen years in Pakistan from 2000 to 2018. On the basis of the above-mentioned results, a new climatic classification has been introduced with five major classes, i.e., drought, aridity, humidity, wetlands and cold drought. The area of five classes has been calculated by using RS tools and RSCCI for the years of 2000 and 2018. New climatic classification of Pakistan divides Pakistan into five regions which is based on RSCCI . There is an increase in arid region of 1.84% in Pakistan from RSCCI 2000 to RCSSI 2018. Similarly, there is also increase in an area of wetlands and humid regions of Pakistan, i.e., 1.9% and 9.72%, respectively, from RSCCI 2000 to RCSSI 2018. On the other hand, there is 0.78% reduction of area of cold drought region, 8.49% reduction in moderate drought and 4.19% reduction in an area of intense drought classes from RSCCI 2000 to RCSSI 2018, which is a positive change. The results show dramatic changes which advocate the need of a new climatic classification for Pakistan. This new climate classification of Pakistan is based on 18 years of data only. Dramatic climatic changes could be imagined and predicted within next 30 years in Pakistan.

TI  - Hybrid hyperspectral image compression technique for non-iterative factorized tensor decomposition and principal component analysis: application for NASA's AVIRIS data
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data has shown tremendous potential for applications in various fields like land use mapping and detection, geologic mapping, water resource applications, wetland mapping, urban and regional planning, environment inventory, natural disaster assessment, archaeological applications, and others. Every day, thousands of gigabytes of memory are involved in capturing the hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. The compelling information present in these hyperspectral images (HSIs) is very minimal due to redundancy. Spatial and spectral correlations monopolize the acquired HSI data sets. Therefore, an algorithm that exploits these correlations and compresses the HSI tensors is proposed in this paper. First, the acquired HSI image (reflectance data) is subjected to the removal of geometric and radiometric errors. Second, spectral bands of interest affiliated to the underlying application are exclusively processed for principal component analysis (PCA). Results of this PCA are scrutinized to identify the absolute dependent components. Further, these components are exposed to a non-iterative factorized compression technique. As a result, HSI 3D tensors are disintegrated into 1D tensors. This tensor breakdown leads to a compression ratio as high as 3747:1 while the total encoding time observed is 332 s and RMSE is as low as 0.0017. Later, the original HSI is reconstructed back by the product of decomposed individual tensors and its PSNR is 53.03 dB. The proposed compression method targets the tucker decomposition-based HSI compression technique which is computationally complex and time consuming, and hence, a breakthrough is achieved with the technique introduced.

TI  - [Monitoring of Saposhnikovia divaricate planting area based on texture and pop information in Naiman banner].
T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The planting area of Chinese medicinal materials is an important basis for formulating policies such as production and poverty alleviation of Chinese medicinal materials and is determining the quantity of medicinal materials trade. Accurately mastering the information of the distribution,area and yield of Chinese medicinal materials cultivation is the basis of the adjustment of the planting structure of traditional Chinese medicine. It is now the largest planting place of Mongolian traditional Chinese medicinal materials in Naiman banner that is belonging to Tongliao city,Inner Mongolia. It is of great significance to obtain the planting area of Mongolian Chinese medicinal materials in Naiman banner in time and effectively for the development of subsequent industries. In this study,Saposhnikovia divaricata,a medicinal plant planted in Naiman banner,was selected as an example,and the fusion 2 m resolution ZY-3 remote sensing image was used as the data source. Based on the ground survey data,the sample data of each typical ground object were selected,and the spectral characteristic curves of different ground objects were obtained,and the S. divaricata spectral information was obtained. Using the filtering texture analysis method based on probability statistics,five kinds of texture image display results under different texture filtering were compared and analyzed,and finally the S. divaricata texture features based on information entropy are determined. The distribution range and planting area of S. divaricata in Naiman banner were extracted and interpreted by using the texture and spectral information of remote sensing images. The results showed that: S. divaricata was mainly distributed in the northeast and central south of Naiman banner,and the planting area was 5 336 mu( 1 mu667 m2). The field verification data were in good agreement with the remote sensing interpretation results,and the difference was small. It shows that the combination of spectral information and texture information can realize the discrimination of S. divaricata,and the interpretation results can provide a reference for the county to formulate the poverty alleviation action of Chinese medicinal material industry and the economic development plan of agricultural producing areas.

TI  - Collaborative Representation-Based Multiscale Superpixel Fusion for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In virtue of the spatial structural characteristic of surface materials, the performance of the hyperspectral image classification can be boosted by incorporating texture information. Normally, the spatial structure can be extracted by predefined operators, including the popular extended multiattribute profiles (EMAPs) and the Gabor filters. Recently, superpixel segmentation, which reflects the homogeneous regularity of objects, has drawn much attention in the field. In this paper, a collaborative representation-based multiscale superpixel fusion (CRMSF) approach has been proposed for the hyperspectral image classification. First, after obtaining the EMAPs from the raw hyperspectral image, a group of predesigned 3-D Gabor wavelet filters is convolved with the EMAP features, and the EMAP-Gabor features can, thus, be achieved. Second, the collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) is employed to fully and efficiently make use of the huge amount of extracted EMAP-Gabor features. Third, multiscale superpixel maps are generated from the EMAP features that are utilized to regularize the classification map obtained by CRC. A heuristic strategy has been specially devised to automatically decide the number of extracted superpixels in multiple scales, which can be perfectly compatible with hyperspectral images having various spatial sizes and spatial resolutions. This is the most important contribution of the developed CRMSF approach. Finally, the classification task is accomplished by fusing the multiple regularized classification maps. The CRMSF approach has been evaluated on four popular hyperspectral image data sets, and the experimental results show the advantages of CRMSF, particularly for a hyperspectral image with high spatial resolution.

TI  - Long-Term Spatial and Temporal Monitoring of Cyanobacteria Blooms Using MODIS on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Taihu Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As cyanobacteria blooms occur in many types of inland water, routine monitoring that is fast and accurate is important for environment and drinking water protection. Compared to field investigations, satellite remote sensing is an efficient and effective method for monitoring cyanobacteria blooms. However, conventional remote sensing monitoring methods are labor intensive and time consuming, especially when processing long-term images. In this study, we embedded related processing procedures in Google Earth Engine, developed an operational cyanobacteria bloom monitoring workflow. Using this workflow, we measured the spatiotemporal patterns of cyanobacteria blooms in China's Taihu Lake from 2000 to 2018. The results show that cyanobacteria bloom patterns in Taihu Lake have significant spatial and temporal differentiation: the interannual coverage of cyanobacteria blooms had two peaks, and the condition was moderate before 2006, peaked in 2007, declined rapidly after 2008, remained moderate and stable until 2015, and then reached another peak around 2017; bays and northwest lake areas had heavier cyanobacteria blooms than open lake areas; most cyanobacteria blooms primarily occurred in April, worsened in July and August, then improved after October. Our analysis of the relationship between cyanobacteria bloom characteristics and environmental driving factors indicates that: from both monthly and interannual perspectives, meteorological factors are positively correlated with cyanobacteria bloom characteristics, but as for nutrient loadings, they are only positively correlated with cyanobacteria bloom characteristics from an interannual perspective. We believe reducing total phosphorous, together with restoring macrophyte ecosystem, would be the necessary long-term management strategies for Taihu Lake. Our workflow provides an automatic and rapid approach for the long-term monitoring of cyanobacteria blooms, which can improve the automation and efficiency of routine environmental management of Taihu Lake and may be applied to other similar inland waters.

TI  - A deep learning algorithm to estimate hourly global solar radiation from geostationary satellite data
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - To apply deep learning technique for estimating hourly global solar radiation (GSR) from geostationary satellite observations, a hybrid deep network is proposed, relying on convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial pattern from satellite imagery, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to link the abstract patterns and additional time/location information to target hourly GSR. Its representative advantage lies in the ability to characterize changeable cloud morphology and simulate complex non-linear relationships. The deep network is trained using ground measured GSR values at 90 Chinese radiation stations in 2008 as well as the radiative transfer model simulation at the top of Mt. Everest which serves as constraints of extrapolation for high elevation regions. The extensibility of trained network is validated at 5 independent stations in 2008, yielding an overall coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82, and at all stations in 2007 along with an R-2 of 0.88. Comparative experiments confirm that the combination of spatial pattern and point information can lead to more accurate estimation of hourly GSR, achieving a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 84.18 W/m(2) (0.30 MJ/m(2)), 1.92 MJ/m(2) and 1.08 MJ/m(2) in hourly, daily total and monthly total scales, respectively. Moreover, the deep network is capable of mapping spatially continuous hourly GSR which reflects the regional differences and reproduce the diurnal cycles of solar radiation properly.

TI  - A mast-cell-specific receptor mediates Iopamidol induced immediate IgE- independent anaphylactoid reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Iopamidol is a radiographic contrast media which caused a very high incidence of anaphylactic reactions. Mast cells are sentinel cells in host defense reactions during immediate hypersensitivity responses and anaphylactic responses. Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) is a kind of mast cell specific receptor, which triggers mast cell degranulation in anaphylactic reactions. Mice MrgprB2 is a homologous gene of MRGPRX2. We sought to better understand the anaphylactic reactions induced by Iopamidol and the mechanisms involving MRGPRX2. The MRGPRX2-related anaphylactic reactions induced by lopamidol were investigated using the hindpaw swelling and extravasation assay in vivo and a calcium imaging assay was used for mast cell intracellular calcium responses detection and mast cell release of anaphylactic mediators, such as beta-hexosaminidase, histamine and TNF-alpha, was also detected in vitro. The mast cell deficient Kit(w-sh/w-sh) mice and MrgprB2 knockout mice exhibited a reduced Iopamidol-induced inflammation effect compared with wild type mice. Furthermore, human mast cells that express MRGPRX2 were activated by Iopamidol in a dose-dependent manner, meanwhile MRGPRX2 knockdown mast cells showed reduced intracellular calcium responses and anaphylactic mediators release effect. It could be concluded that Iopamidol-induced anaphylactoid reactions were MRGPRX2 mediated to provoke mast cells Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation.

TI  - A Hierarchical Classification Framework of Satellite Multispectral/Hyperspectral Images for Mapping Coastal Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping different land cover types with satellite remote sensing data is significant for restoring and protecting natural resources and ecological services in coastal wetlands. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical classification framework (HCF) that implements two levels of classification scheme to identify different land cover types of coastal wetlands. The first level utilizes the designed decision tree to roughly group land covers into four rough classes and the second level combines multiple features (i.e., spectral feature, texture feature and geometric feature) of each class to distinguish different subtypes of land covers in each rough class. Two groups of classification experiments on Landsat and Sentinel multispectral data and China Gaofen (GF)-5 hyperspectral data are carried out in order to testify the classification behaviors of two famous coastal wetlands of China, that is, Yellow River Estuary and Yancheng coastal wetland. Experimental results on Landsat data show that the proposed HCF performs better than support vector machine and random forest in classifying land covers of coastal wetlands. Moreover, HCF is suitable for both multispectral data and hyperspectral data and the GF-5 data is superior to Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 multispectral data in obtaining fine classification results of coastal wetlands.

TI  - A Multiscale Assimilation Approach to Improve Fine-Resolution Leaf Area Index Dynamics
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine spatial details of vegetation growth are usually lost in leaf area index (LAI) products obtained from coarse spatial resolution satellite sensors. This may bring uncertainties in ecosystem process models, which usually require LAI products with fine spatiotemporal resolutions. Successful downscaling of LAI dynamics to fine spatial resolution is very important for meeting the demands of these models. Hence, a multiscale multisensor approach using the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) technique is proposed in this paper. The LAI dynamics at a coarser spatial resolution are incorporated as prior information into the remotely sensed observations for time series LAI estimation at a finer spatial resolution. Downscaled LAI dynamics are evaluated based on spatial distribution and temporal trajectory. The results indicate the assimilated LAI to be in good agreement with the reference values at the different spatial scales. For example, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the reference values and fine-resolution LAI results retrieved by the proposed approach is 0.71 with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) value of 0.65 on Julian day 185 at the Agro site. The method has proved to be effective for downscaling LAI dynamics, which improves the spatiotemporal patterns of fine-resolution LAI retrievals with respect to earlier methods.

TI  - Retrieval of 500 m Aerosol Optical Depths from MODIS Measurements over Urban Surfaces under Heavy Aerosol Loading Conditions in Winter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products are used worldwide for their reliable accuracy. However, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) usually retrieved by the operational dark target (DT) algorithm of MODIS has been missing for most of the urban regions in Central China. This was due to a high surface reflectance and heavy aerosol loading, especially in winter, when a high cloud cover fraction and the frequent occurrence of haze events reduce the number of effective satellite observations. The retrieval of the AOD from limited satellite data is much needed and important for further aerosol investigations. In this paper, we propose an improved AOD retrieval method for 500 m MODIS data, which is based on an extended surface reflectance estimation scheme and dynamic aerosol models derived from ground-based sun-photometric observations. This improved method was applied to retrieve AOD during heavy aerosol loading and effectively complements the scarcity of AOD in correspondence with urban surface of a higher spatial resolution. The validation results showed that the retrieved AOD was consistent with MODIS DT AOD (R = 0.87; RMSE = 0.11) and ground measurements (R = 0.89; RMSE = 0.15) from both the Terra and the Aqua satellite. The method can be easily applied to different urban environments affected by air pollution and contributes to the research on aerosol.

TI  - A Two-Stage Fusion Framework to Generate a Spatio-Temporally Continuous MODIS NDSI Product over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is an important component of the global environmental system, on which the snow cover greatly affects the regional climate and ecology. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products have been demonstrated to be appropriate for investigating the snow cover over the TP. However, they are subject to cloud obscuration, and the TP's extremely complex terrain makes the snow monitoring difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal fusion framework for the cloud removal of MODIS C6 snow products, including an adjusted Terra and Aqua combination (TAC) and a spatio-temporal fusion based on Gaussian kernel function and error correction (STF-GKF-EC). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a spatio-temporally continuous daily 500-m MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI) product has been generated for the TP, which greatly improves the spatial and temporal resolutions of the current snow cover products. The main stage, STF-GKF-EC, adaptively weights the spatial and temporal correlations by the Gaussian kernel function, and further takes the rapid changes of snow cover into consideration through the error correction. The experiments indicated that STF-GKF-EC removes clouds completely, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 91.48% and 3.88, respectively. Based on the cloud-removed results, during 2001-2017, as far as the intra-annual variation is concerned, a large proportion of the snow cover appears between October and May, with a peak in February/March, and the variation is mainly controlled by temperature. For the inter-annual variation, an obvious increasing trend of 0.68/year for NDSI is observed before 2005, followed by a slight decreasing trend of 0.16/year, in which precipitation is a better explanation factor than temperature.

TI  - Local Climate Zone (LCZ) Map Accuracy Assessments Should Account for Land Cover Physical Characteristics that Affect the Local Thermal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climate zone (LCZ) maps are increasingly being used to help understand and model the urban microclimate, but traditional land use/land cover map (LULC) accuracy assessment approaches do not convey the accuracy at which LCZ maps depict the local thermal environment. 17 types of LCZs exist, each having unique physical characteristics that affect the local microclimate. Many studies have focused on generating LCZ maps using remote sensing data, but nearly all have used traditional LULC map accuracy metrics, which penalize all map classification errors equally, to evaluate the accuracy of these maps. Here, we proposed a new accuracy assessment approach that better explains the accuracy of the physical properties (i.e., surface structure, land cover, and anthropogenic heat emissions) depicted in an LCZ map, which allows for a better understanding of the accuracy at which the map portrays the local thermal environment.

TI  - Using the Landsat archive to map crop cover history across the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat Thematic Mapper has been collecting multispectral imagery at 30 m resolution globally since 1984. One utility of the data has been for detailed mapping of agricultural regions and seasonal identification of crops grown within them. However, the ability to do so has only been applied sporadically and eluded widespread adoption due to cost of the imagery, burdensome preprocessing requirements, and computing not being up to the task. These hurdles have become much reduced of recent with the free and open distribution of the Landsat imagery, emphasis on ready-to-use surface reflectance data products, and distributed high performance computing infrastructures available online in "the cloud." As such, this work leverages these aspects and investigates the ability to retrospectively map summer crops over the United States (US) annually from 1984 to 2007. Google's Earth Engine Internet-based analytical platform containing the historical Landsat archive in surface reflectance format was used as a foundation for the classification work. Robust 30 m Cropland Data Layer (CDL) information from US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for years 2008 through 2011 were leveraged to train rule-based classifiers which were applied back through time to each year 1984 through 2007. Focus crops were corn, soybeans, and winter wheat - the three largest by area in the US. A large sampling of highly intensive counties throughout the country were prototyped for generation of the 24 years of historical crop cover. For validation, crop area statistics were calculated for each county-year and compared to survey-based information existing from the USDA. Results were muted overall with the average crop area coefficient of determination (R-2) correlations for the years 1984-2007 found to be 0.192, 0.159, and 0.142 for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat, respectively. Furthermore, the standard deviations were variable at 0.132, 0.177, and 0.133, also respectively. While unimpressive, it was found as a benchmark that the R2 between the 2008 through 2017 CDL classifications were only 0.478, 0.686, and 0.726 and thus a suggestion that the USDA area statistics are an imperfect measure of map accuracy. Deletion of approximately one third to one half of the grossest 1984-2007 outlier years from the historical outputs pulled the correlations to the benchmark standard. Qualitatively, most of the remaining years classified looked of high quality and were believed useful as field-level thematic crop area maps. These historical cropland maps could provide the ability to better detail the role farming has played on the broad US landscape over recent decades.

TI  - Cloud detection algorithm using SVM with SWIR2 and tasseled cap applied to Landsat 8
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellite images are subject to cloud cover effects resulting in erroneous analysis and observations of ground features. In this work, we present a novel algorithm (STmask) combining tasseled cap band 4 (TC4) with short wave infrared spectral band 2, SWIR2 (2.107-2.294 mu m) for generating cloud, water, shadow, snow and vegetation masks. A support vector machine (SVM) with a non-linear kernel is trained on a feature space of TC4 versus SWIR2 for generating feature masks. To develop a generic and unbiased algorithm, the SVM is trained using reference data comprised of 12891 pixels from Landsat 8 scenes from ten spatially and temporally diverse biomes including deciduous forest, rainforest, great plain, savanna, desert, ocean, freshwater, taiga, tundra, and icesheet. 960000 text pixels spanning 96 scenes across 8 biomes from the USGS Landsat cloud cover assessment data set are used for accuracy assessment of STmask as well as to compare its performance with the operational Landsat algorithm, C function of mask (CFmask). Using McNemar's statistic, STmask is shown to maximize both the precision and sensitivity of the classification of all features compared to CFmask. It addresses the challenges of CFmask through statistically significant improvement in the precision of cloud detection over snow/ice, barren, water, urban, and shrubland biomes. Aggregated over all biomes, the average improvement in cloud detection over CFmask is observed to be similar to 3.8% using the F-measure. The classification of non-cloud features exhibits promising improvements and mostly comparable performance to CFmask. Overall classification performance is promising, and thus STmask is a novel, biome-independent, parsimonious, and computationally efficient alternative (and/or a cloud screening addition) to the operational CFmask algorithm. The work is timely and is targeted as an innovative processing solution for the land surface remote sensing research community.

TI  - Estimation of Typhoon Center Using Satellite SAR Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and rapid climate change have long affected the characteristics of typhoons in the Northwest Pacific, which has induced increasing devastating disasters along the coastal regions of the Korean peninsula. Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR), as one of the microwave sensors, makes it possible to produce high-resolution sea surface wind field around the typhoon under cloudy atmospheric conditions, which has been impossible to obtain the winds from satellite optical and infrared sensors. The Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) for sea surface wind retrieval from SAR data requires the input of wind direction, which should be based on the accurate estimation of the center of the typhoon. This study estimated the typhoon centers using Sentinel-1A images to improve the problem of typhoon center detection method and to reflect it in retrieving the sea surface wind. The results were validated by comparing with the typhoon best track data provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and also by using infrared images of Himawari-8 satellite. The initial center position of the typhoon was determined by using VII polarization, thereby reducing the possibility of error. The detected center showed a difference of 23.76 km on average with the best track data of the four typhoons provided by the KMA and JMA. Compared to the typhoon center estimated by Himawari-8 satellite, the results showed an average spatial variation of 11.80 km except one typhoon located near land with a large difference of 58.73 km. This result suggests that high-resolution SAR images can be used to estimate the center and retrieve sea surface wind around typhoons.

TI  - Classification of very high-resolution remote sensing images by applying a new edge-based marker-controlled watershed segmentation method
T2  - SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology have led to the creation of many sensors with very high spatial resolution, which enable researchers to detect and recognize earth surface features precisely in fine detail. There is an increasing demand for the development of algorithms to extract geometrical and spatial information from these kinds of images as the prerequisite for accurate thematic map generation. Among the existing techniques, segmentation-based methods are of great interest due to their capabilities in extracting spatial information of the image. In this article, a new watershed segmentation approach is proposed where the image edge information is exploited to improve the results. Next to its simplicity, the main characteristic of this newly proposed method is that there is no need to set any effective parameter(s), a common drawback confronted by most state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. The method is first applied to a well-known dataset, and the result of the segmentation phase is evaluated. The segmentation and classification phases of our approach are then both applied to selected Pleiades and WorldView-2 images. The final spatial-spectral classification map is compared to the results obtained through three common segmentation-based classification methods. The result of this comparison indicates that our approach outperforms the others by having 94.94% overall accuracy for a Pleiades image and 89.81% overall accuracy for a WorldView-2 image.

TI  - Sustainable development in cities: Studying the relationship between groundwater level and urbanization using remote sensing data
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable urban development has been one of the main concerns for policy-makers and increasing rate of population and urbanization have resulted in several socio-environmental impacts on people. Hence, water resources management in cities, as one of the most vital strategies, has become more complicated and challenging. In this study, the impact of urbanization and land cover change on groundwater level fluctuations was assessed. Using remote sensing data from different satellites and missions, data of water storage mass, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, land cover etc. was extracted and processed by employing different programming languages and mapping tools. Atlanta metro area in Georgia, USA was selected as the case study location and the potential impacts of urban development in this city on groundwater resources were studied. The results suggest that from 2001 to 2013, limited urban development has happened in Atlanta; while this urbanization rate was more intense during previous decades and is predicted to be increased by 2050. Therefore, although other land cover types may be more correlated, results of correlating groundwater level with urban land cover is inconclusive for Atlanta metro area. Nonetheless, since relationship between urbanization and GW level variations is undeniable, novel methodology of this study can be employed for other fast-growing cities, especially in China and India.

TI  - Parallel Cellular Automata Markov Model for Land Use Change Prediction over MapReduce Framework
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cellular Automata Markov model combines the cellular automata (CA) model's ability to simulate the spatial variation of complex systems and the long-term prediction of the Markov model. In this research, we designed a parallel CA-Markov model based on the MapReduce framework. The model was divided into two main parts: A parallel Markov model based on MapReduce (Cloud-Markov), and comprehensive evaluation method of land-use changes based on cellular automata and MapReduce (Cloud-CELUC). Choosing Hangzhou as the study area and using Landsat remote-sensing images from 2006 and 2013 as the experiment data, we conducted three experiments to evaluate the parallel CA-Markov model on the Hadoop environment. Efficiency evaluations were conducted to compare Cloud-Markov and Cloud-CELUC with different numbers of data. The results showed that the accelerated ratios of Cloud-Markov and Cloud-CELUC were 3.43 and 1.86, respectively, compared with their serial algorithms. The validity test of the prediction algorithm was performed using the parallel CA-Markov model to simulate land-use changes in Hangzhou in 2013 and to analyze the relationship between the simulation results and the interpretation results of the remote-sensing images. The Kappa coefficients of construction land, natural-reserve land, and agricultural land were 0.86, 0.68, and 0.66, respectively, which demonstrates the validity of the parallel model. Hangzhou land-use changes in 2020 were predicted and analyzed. The results show that the central area of construction land is rapidly increasing due to a developed transportation system and is mainly transferred from agricultural land.

TI  - New Gap-Filling Strategies for Long-Period Flux Data Gaps Using a Data-Driven Approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Korea Flux Monitoring Network, Haenam Farmland has the longest record of carbon/water/energy flux measurements produced using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. Unfortunately, there are long gaps (i.e., gaps longer than 30 days), particularly in 2007 and 2014, which hinder attempts to analyze these decade-long time-series data. The open source and standardized gap-filling methods are impractical for such long gaps. The data-driven approach using machine learning and remote-sensing or reanalysis data (i.e., interpolating/extrapolating EC measurements via available networks temporally/spatially) for estimating terrestrial CO2/H2O fluxes at the regional/global scale is applicable after appropriate modifications. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the data-driven approach for filling long gaps in flux data (i.e., gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, and evapotranspiration). We found that using a longer training dataset in the machine learning generally produced better model performance, although there was a greater possibility of missing interannual variations caused by ecosystem state changes (e.g., changes in crop variety). Based on the results, we proposed gap-filling strategies for long-period flux data gaps and used them to quantify the annual sums with uncertainties in 2007 and 2014. The results from this study have broad implications for long-period gap-filling at other sites, and for the estimation of regional/global CO2/H2O fluxes using a data-driven approach.

TI  - Assessing Legacy Effects of Wildfires on the Crown Structure of Fire-Tolerant Eucalypt Trees Using Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fire-tolerant eucalypt forests of south eastern Australia are assumed to fully recover from even the most intense fires; however, surprisingly, very few studies have quantitatively assessed that recovery. The accurate assessment of horizontal and vertical attributes of tree crowns after fire is essential to understand the fire's legacy effects on tree growth and on forest structure. In this study, we quantitatively assessed individual tree crowns 8.5 years after a 2009 wildfire that burnt extensive areas of eucalypt forest in temperate Australia. We used airborne LiDAR data validated with field measurements to estimate multiple metrics that quantified the cover, density, and vertical distribution of individual-tree crowns in 51 plots of 0.05 ha in fire-tolerant eucalypt forest across four wildfire severity types (unburnt, low, moderate, high). Significant differences in the field-assessed mean height of fire scarring as a proportion of tree height and in the proportions of trees with epicormic (stem) resprouts were consistent with the gradation in fire severity. Linear mixed-effects models indicated persistent effects of both moderate and high-severity wildfire on tree crown architecture. Trees at high-severity sites had significantly less crown projection area and live crown width as a proportion of total crown width than those at unburnt and low-severity sites. Significant differences in LiDAR-based metrics (crown cover, evenness, leaf area density profiles) indicated that tree crowns at moderate and high-severity sites were comparatively narrow and more evenly distributed down the tree stem. These conical-shaped crowns contrasted sharply with the rounded crowns of trees at unburnt and low-severity sites and likely influenced both tree productivity and the accuracy of biomass allometric equations for nearly a decade after the fire. Our data provide a clear example of the utility of airborne LiDAR data for quantifying the impacts of disturbances at the scale of individual trees. Quantified effects of contrasting fire severities on the structure of resprouter tree crowns provide a strong basis for interpreting post-fire patterns in forest canopies and vegetation profiles in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and other remotely-sensed data at larger scales.

TI  - Spatial and Seasonal Patterns in Vegetation Growth-Limiting Factors over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water and energy are recognized as the most influential climatic vegetation growth-limiting factors. These factors are usually measured from ground meteorological stations. However, since both vary in space, time, and scale, they can be assessed by satellite-derived biophysical indicators. Energy, represented by land surface temperature (LST), is assumed to resemble air temperature; and water availability, related to precipitation, is represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). It is hypothesized that positive correlations between LST and NDVI indicate energy-limited conditions, while negative correlations indicate water-limited conditions. The current project aimed to quantify the spatial and seasonal (spring and summer) distributions of LST-NDVI relations over Europe, using long-term (2000-2017) MODIS images. Overlaying the LST-NDVI relations on the European biome map revealed that relations between LST and NDVI were highly diverse among the various biomes and throughout the entire study period (March-August). During the spring season (March-May), 80% of the European domain, across all biomes, showed the dominance of significant positive relations. However, during the summer season (June-August), most of the biomes-except the northern ones-turned to negative correlation. This study demonstrates that the drought/vegetation/stress spectral indices, based on the prevalent hypothesis of an inverse LST-NDVI correlation, are spatially and temporally dependent. These negative correlations are not valid in regions where energy is the limiting factor (e.g., in the drier regions in the southern and eastern extents of the domain) or during specific periods of the year (e.g., the spring season). Consequently, it is essential to re-examine this assumption and restrict applications of such an approach only to areas and periods in which negative correlations are observed. Predicted climate change will lead to an increase in temperature in the coming decades (i.e., increased LST), as well as a complex pattern of precipitation changes (i.e., changes of NDVI). Thus shifts in plant species locations are expected to cause a redistribution of biomes.

TI  - Grizzly bear selection of recently harvested forests is dependent on forest recovery rate and landscape composition
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in the early stages of regeneration are valuable habitat for threatened grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations inhabiting the interior mountains of North America, with forest management affecting the timing, prevalence, and quality of such habitats. Forest harvesting can lead to early-seral habitat, however the quality and duration of post-harvest habitat compared to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire), is not known. North American silvicultural practices are mandated to ensure tree regrowth following harvesting, and a rapid rate of growth in managed tree regeneration may lead to a shorter time window during which attractive early-seral habitat is available to bears compared to natural forest disturbances. The distribution of natural disturbances across forested landscapes may also be an important consideration in the response of bears to forest harvesting. In this study, we analyzed grizzly bear habitat selection for 160 collared grizzly bears across 118,000-km(2) (68% of their known habitat) in Alberta, Canada, using metrics of forest disturbance and recovery derived from a 33-year satellite time series. We developed seasonal resource selection functions to evaluate (1) if selection of recently harvested forests was contingent upon the availability of natural disturbances, (2) how habitat selection within disturbed areas varied across disturbance types, and (3) how habitat suitability changed over time during the first 30 years of forest recovery following various disturbance types. Results showed that, compared to areas not recently disturbed, grizzly bears were up to three times more likely to select for harvested forests when natural disturbances were limited in their home range, while selection of harvested forests was neutral when natural disturbances were abundant. When available, grizzly bears were more likely to select for natural disturbances compared to harvested locations, especially during Hypophagia (spring) and Hyperphagia (fall). Selection of harvested locations was inversely related to forest recovery assessed by spectral analysis and decreased sharply 15-20 years post-harvest, at which point it tended to be lower than pre-disturbance. This study demonstrates the utility of vegetation, disturbance, and recovery metrics derived from satellite time series for enriching our understanding of wildlife habitat selection in dynamic landscapes. Our results also have implications for forest management in regions where grizzly bear habitat availability and selection patterns are important. While rapid forest recovery following harvest is desirable and beneficial for a multitude of ecological and economic objectives, it appears to minimize the period of attractive early-seral habitat for grizzly bears.

TI  - pyjeo: A Python Package for the Analysis of Geospatial Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A new Python package, pyjeo, that deals with the analysis of geospatial data has been created by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Adopting the principles of open science, the JRC strives for transparency and reproducibility of results. In this view, it has been decided to release pyjeo as free and open software. This paper describes the design of pyjeo and how its underlying C/C++ library was ported to Python. Strengths and limitations of the design choices are discussed. In particular, the data model that allows the generation of on-the-fly data cubes is of importance. Two uses cases illustrate how pyjeo can contribute to open science. The first is an example of large-scale processing, where pyjeo was used to create a global composite of Sentinel-2 data. The second shows how pyjeo can be imported within an interactive platform for image analysis and visualization. Using an innovative mechanism that interprets Python code within a C++ library on-the-fly, users can benefit from all functions in the pyjeo package. Images are processed in deferred mode, which is ideal for prototyping new algorithms on geospatial data, and assess the suitability of the results created on the fly at any scale and location.

TI  - Toward Generalized Change Detection on Planetary Surfaces With Convolutional Autoencoders and Transfer Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing planetary exploration missions are returning large volumes of image data. Identifying surface changes in these images, e.g., new impact craters, is critical for investigating many scientific hypotheses. Traditional approaches to change detection rely on image differencing and manual feature engineering. These methods can be sensitive to irrelevant variations in illumination or image quality and typically require before and after images to be coregistered, which itself is a major challenge. Additionally, most prior change detection studies have been limited to remote sensing images of earth. We propose a new deep learning approach for binary patch-level change detection involving transfer learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction using convolutional autoencoders. Our experiments on diverse remote sensing datasets of Mars, the moon, and earth show that our methods can detect meaningful changes with high accuracy using a relatively small training dataset despite significant differences in illumination, image quality, imaging sensors, coregistration, and surface properties. We show that the latent representations learned by a convolutional autoencoder yield the most general representations for detecting change across surface feature types, scales, sensors, and planetary bodies.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Spatiotemporal Urban Expansion Patterns by Fusing OSM and Landsat Data in Kathmandu
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last few decades, a large number of people have migrated to Kathmandu city from all parts of Nepal, resulting in rapid expansion of the city. The unplanned and accelerated growth is causing many environmental and population management issues. To manage urban growth efficiently, the city authorities need a means to be able to monitor urban expansion regularly. In this study, we introduced a novel approach to automatically detect urban expansion by leveraging state-of-the-art cloud computing technologies using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We proposed a new index named Normalized Difference and Distance Built-up Index (NDDBI) for identifying built-up areas by combining the LandSat-derived vegetation index with distances from the nearest roads and buildings analysed from OpenStreetMap (OSM). We also focused on logical consistencies of land-cover change to remove unreasonable transitions supported by the repeat photography. Our analysis of the historical urban growth patterns between 2000 and 2018 shows that the settlement areas were increased from 63.68 sq km in 2000 to 148.53 sq km in 2018. The overall accuracy of mapping the newly-built areas of urban expansion was 94.33%. We have demonstrated that the methodology and data generated in the study can be replicated to easily map built-up areas and support quicker and more efficient land management and land-use planning in rapidly growing cities worldwide.

TI  - Land surface temperature anomalies in response to changes in forest cover
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover/use changes specially the forest cover changes affect the local surface temperature (LST) of the earth. In this study, a combination of remote sensing and GIS techniques was used to scrutinize the interactions between LST anomalies and deforestation in Sardasht County, NW Iran. The land cover/use change layers of the study area were extracted from Landsat satellite imagery based on Binary Encoding classification and change detection technique. The radiometric correction analysis were done for each Landsat image to derive LST map layers. According to the results, a descending trend in forest cover with a total 2560 ha decline in area and an ascending trend of about 4 degrees rise in surface temperature values on both forest and non-forest areas were detected in the study area from 1984 to 2017. The temporal and spatial analysis yielded high rates of reverse temporal correlation (-0.81) between forest areas and LST anomalies while the correlation value of 0.76 was found for non-forest areas and LST. The regression analysis of the values confirmed the correlation results to be trustable at 99 percent. It was also found that the deforested areas of the study area correlate with the LST rise spatially with a very high correlation (0.98) from which a tangible interaction of the parameters can be inferred.

TI  - Comparing risk stratification criteria for predicting lymphatic dissemination in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - ACOG District IV and 6th Annual Meeting
CL  - Savannah, GA
AB  - Objective. To compare two published risk stratification models (Milwaukee Model vs. Mayo Criteria) to predict lymphatic dissemination (LD) in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. Patients with stage I-III EC undergoing surgery from 1/1/2004-9/30/2013 were retrospectively reviewed and classified as low-risk vs at-risk for LD using two independent risk models. LD was defined as positive nodes at surgery or lymph node recurrence within 2 years of surgery after negative lymph node dissection (LND) or when LND was not performed. False positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates for each risk model were calculated.Results. Among 1103 patients, 81 (7.3%) had LD (72 positive LN and 9 LN recurrences), and most (90.2%) had stage I EC. The Milwaukee Model yielded a low at-risk rate for LD (38.1%) but a high FN rate (13.6%, 95% CI 7.0-23.0). The traditional Mayo Criteria using a cut-off of 2 cm for tumor diameter (TD) had a higher at-risk rate for LD (69.5%) but a FN rate of 0% (95% CI, 0-4.5). Modifying the Mayo Criteria using a TD cutoff of cm identified fewer women at-risk (56.8% vs. 69.5%) and had a lower FP rate (53.6% vs. 67.1%), but had a higher FN rate (3.7%, 95% CI, 0.8-10.4).Conclusions. The Milwaukee Model had the lowest at-risk rate of LD but an unacceptable FN rate. Modifying the Mayo Criteria by increasing the TD cutoff from the traditional cm to cm would spare an estimated 13.5% of patients LND, but the accompanying FN rate is unacceptably high. The traditional Mayo Criteria for low-risk EC remains the most sensitive in determining which patients LND can be omitted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - <i>In vitro</i> estimation of metal-induced disturbance in chicken gut-oviduct chemokine circuit
T2  - MOLECULAR & CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds Heavy metals affect various processes in the embryonic development. Embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) play key roles in the innate recognition and wound healing in reproductive tissues. Methods Based on the relative toxicities of different inorganic metals and inorganic nonmetallic compounds against murine and chicken EF cells, mechanistic estimations were performed based on transcriptomic analyses. Results Lead (II) acetate induced preferential injuries in the chicken EF and mechanistic analyses using transcriptome revealed that chemokine receptor-associated events are potently involved in metal-induced adverse actions. As an early sentinel of metal exposure, the precision-cut intestine slices (PCIS) induced the expression of chemokines including CXCLi1 or CXCLi2, which were potent gut-derived factors that activate chemokine receptors in reproductive organs after circulation. Conclusion EF-selective metals can be estimated to trigger the chemokine circuit in the gut-reproductive axis of chickens. This in vitro methodology using PCIS-EF culture could be used as a promising alternate platform for the reproductive immunotoxicological assessment.

AB  - Meteorological satellites have evolved significantly during past six decades and now the observations from these satellites are indispensable for weather monitoring and prediction. These observations are critical for monitoring the development of weather e.g., the movement of tropical storms and severe weather and provide atmospheric measurements that are ingested into the numerical on (NWP) models for accurate weather prediction. This article describes different types of meteorological satellites, sensors and the atmospheric observations from these sensors. Results of Observation System Simulation Studies (OSSE) using satellite data are briefly described to show the relative impact of observations from satellite sensors and conventional ground based observation network.

TI  - Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging with Lymphoscintigraphy for Sentinel Node Biopsy in Melanoma: Increasing the Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Rate
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The goal of this study was to analyze patients who underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in melanoma with the combination of radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging to compare our true positive (TP) rate, a means to perform immediate analysis of the SLNB, with that of the literature. Methods Consecutive cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent SLNB with lymphoscintigraphy and ICG-based fluorescence imaging by the senior author (BG) from 2012 to 2018 were prospectively enrolled. The average expected SLN-positive rate per T stage was calculated based on three studies and compared with our SLN-positive rate. Results Overall, 574 consecutive patients were analyzed. Average Breslow thickness was 1.9 mm. A total of 1754 sentinel nodes were sampled; 1497 were identified by gamma probe signaling and ICG, 241 were identified by gamma probe signaling only, and 16 were identified by ICG only. There were 123 (21.4%) patients with at least one positive SLN; 113 (91.9%) had at least one positive node identified with both gamma probe signaling and ICG, 8 (6.5%) had positive node(s) identified with gamma probe signaling only, and 2 (1.6%) had positive node(s) identified with ICG only. There was an overall 21.4% SLN-positive rate, with 8% T1, 18.5% T2, 41.1% T3, and 52.4% T4, which is higher than the predicted rates for each stage. Conclusions With the largest cohort of patients reported who underwent a melanoma SLNB with lymphoscintigraphy and ICG, we demonstrated that this technique results in higher SLN-positive rates than predicted. Patients are being followed but, given the TP data, knowledge of our results may foster the use of this modality to improve staging and treatment options.

TI  - Retrieval of Snow Properties from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) architecture facilitates Earth Observation data processing. In this work, we present results from a new Snow Processor for SNAP. We also describe physical principles behind the developed snow property retrieval technique based on the analysis of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A/B measurements over clean and polluted snow fields. Using OLCI spectral reflectance measurements in the range 400-1020 nm, we derived important snow properties such as spectral and broadband albedo, snow specific surface area, snow extent and grain size on a spatial grid of 300 m. The algorithm also incorporated cloud screening and atmospheric correction procedures over snow surfaces. We present validation results using ground measurements from Antarctica, the Greenland ice sheet and the French Alps. We find the spectral albedo retrieved with accuracy of better than 3% on average, making our retrievals sufficient for a variety of applications. Broadband albedo is retrieved with the average accuracy of about 5% over snow. Therefore, the uncertainties of satellite retrievals are close to experimental errors of ground measurements. The retrieved surface grain size shows good agreement with ground observations. Snow specific surface area observations are also consistent with our OLCI retrievals. We present snow albedo and grain size mapping over the inland ice sheet of Greenland for areas including dry snow, melted/melting snow and impurity rich bare ice. The algorithm can be applied to OLCI Sentinel-3 measurements providing an opportunity for creation of long-term snow property records essential for climate monitoring and data assimilation studies-especially in the Arctic region, where we face rapid environmental changes including reduction of snow/ice extent and, therefore, planetary albedo.

TI  - Automatic Inundation Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Data Applicable to Both Camargue and Donana Biosphere Reserves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding periodicity is crucial for biomass production and ecosystem functions in wetland areas. Local monitoring networks may be enriched by spaceborne derived products with a temporal resolution of a few days. Unsupervised computer vision techniques are preferred, since human interference and the use of training data may be kept to a minimum. Recently, a novel automatic local thresholding unsupervised methodology for separating inundated areas from non-inundated ones led to successful results for the Donana Biosphere Reserve. This study examines the applicability of this approach to Camarque Biosphere Reserve, and proposes alternatives to the original approach to enhance accuracy and applicability for both Camargue and Donana wetlands in a scientific quest for methods that may serve accurately biomes at both protected areas. In particular, it examines alternative inputs for automatically estimating thresholds while applying various algorithms for estimating the splitting thresholds. Reference maps for Camargue are provided by local authorities, and generated using Sentinel-2 Band 8A (NIR) and Band 12 (SWIR-2). The alternative approaches examined led to high inundation mapping accuracy. In particular, for the Camargue study area and 39 different dates, the alternative approach with the highest overall Kappa coefficient is 0.84, while, for the Donana Biosphere Reserve and Donana marshland (a subset of Donana Reserve) and 7 different dates, is 0.85 and 0.94, respectively. Moreover, there are alternative approaches with high overall Kappa for all areas, i.e., at 0.79 for Camargue, over 0.91 for Donana marshland, and over 0.82 for Donana Reserve. Additionally, this study identifies the alternative approaches that perform better when the study area is extensively covered by temporary flooded and emergent vegetation areas (i.e., Camargue Reserve and Donana marshland) or when it contains a large percentage of dry areas (i.e., Donana Reserve). The development of credible automatic thresholding techniques that can be applied to different wetlands could lead to a higher degree of automation for map production, while enhancing service utilization by non-trained personnel.

TI  - Spectral Index-Based Monitoring (2000-2017) in Lowland Forests to Evaluate the Effects of Climate Change
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the next decades, climate change will put forests in the Hungarian Great Plain in the Carpathian Basin to the test, e.g., changing seasonal patterns, more intense storms, longer dry periods, and pests are expected to occur. To aid in the decision-making process for the conservation of ecosystems depending on forestry, how woods could adapt to changing meso- and microclimatic conditions in the near future needs to be defined. In addition to trendlike warming processes, calculations show an increase in climate extremes, which need to be monitored in accordance with spatial planning, at least for medium-scale mappings. We can use the MODIS sensor dataset if up-to-date terrestrial conditions and multi-decadal geographical processes are of interest. For geographic evaluations of changes, we used vegetation spectral indices; Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the summer half year, 16-day MODIS data composites between 2000 and 2017 in an intensively forested study area in the Hungarian Great Plain. We delineated forest areas on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve using Corine Land Cover maps (2000, 2006, and 2012). Mid-year changes over the nearly two-decade-long period are currently in balance; however, based on their reactions, forests are highly sensitive to abrupt changes caused by extreme climatic events. The higher occurrence of years or periods with extreme water shortages marks an observable decrease in biomass production, even in shorter index time series, such as that between 2004 and 2012. In the drought-stricken July-August periods, the effect of a dry year, subsequent to years with more precipitation, immediately pushes back the green mass and the reduction in the biomass production could become persistent, according to climatology predictions. The changes of specific sub-periods in the vegetation period can be evaluated even in a relatively short, 18-year data series, including the change in the growing values of the vegetative growth in spring or the increase in the summertime biomass production. Standardized differences highlight spatial differences in the biomass production; in response to years with the highest (negative) biomass difference; typically, the northern and southwestern parts of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve in the study area have longer lasting losses in biomass production. A comparison of NDVI and EVI values with the PaDI drought index and the vegetation indices of LANDSAT Operational Land Imager sensor respectively confirms our results.

TI  - EVALUATION OF BURNED AREAS WITH SENTINEL-2 USING SNAP: THE CASE OF KINETA AND MATI, GREECE, JULY 2018
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to compare the two largest forest fires that occurred in Greece in July 2018 using metrics for burned area and burn severity mapping, derived only from free satellite data. Sentinel-2 satellite images of the European Space Agency (ESA) within the Copernicus program provide a spatial resolution of 10 m, which facilitates more accurate monitoring of environmental phenomena such as forest fires. The processing of the satellite images and the calculation of the metrics was performed using SNAP software, which is an open-source software developed by ESA. The mapping of the obtained results was performed in the QGIS software, which is also an open-source software. The delimitation of the burned area and the classification of the severity of both wildfires was performed using the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) satellite index. These results were contrasted with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps related to these two events. Our results obtained in relation to the size of the burned area show smaller affected areas than the Copernicus Emergency Management Service maps. This is explained by the different methods used in the delimitation of the burned areas. In the case of Mati's wildfire the EMS has created the thematic layer by means of visual interpretation using post-event satellite image and in the case of Kineta's wildfire was applied a semi-automatic approach. Moreover, in this study is proposed and evaluated a new burn severity metric, the burned vegetation index (BVI) which shows where the most significant changes in healthy vegetation occurred. This new index was compared with RBR, dNDVI and dNBR using statistical correlation. The results indicate that BVI shows better the burned vegetation and its statistical correlation with RBR is significant (R-2 = 0.92).

TI  - A Relief Dependent Evaluation of Digital Elevation Models on Different Scales for Northern Chile
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many geoscientific computations are directly influenced by the resolution and accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs). Therefore, knowledge about the accuracy of DEMs is essential to avoid misleading results. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the vertical accuracy of globally available DEMs from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D and TanDEM-X WorldDEM (TM) was conducted for a large region in Northern Chile. Additionally, several very high-resolution DEM datasets were derived from Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 6/7 and Pleiades stereo satellite imagery for smaller areas. All datasets were evaluated with three reference datasets, namely elevation points from both Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat) satellites, as well as very accurate high-resolution elevation data derived by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The accuracy was also evaluated with regard to the existing relief by relating the accuracy results to slope, terrain ruggedness index (TRI) and topographic position index (TPI). For all datasets with global availability, the highest overall accuracies are reached by TanDEM-X WorldDEM (TM) and the lowest by ASTER Global DEM (GDEM). On the local scale, Pleiades DEMs showed a slightly higher accuracy as SPOT imagery. Generally, accuracy highly depends on topography and the error is rising up to four times for high resolution DEMs and up to eight times for low-resolution DEMs in steeply sloped terrain compared to flat landscapes.

TI  - Machine Learning Methods for Classification of the Green Infrastructure in City Areas
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in cities can result in a decrease in green urban areas. Reductions in green urban infrastructure pose a threat to the sustainability of cities. Up-to-date maps are important for the effective planning of urban development and the maintenance of green urban infrastructure. There are many possible ways to map vegetation; however, the most effective way is to apply machine learning methods to satellite imagery. In this study, we analyze four machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network, and the naive Bayes classifier) for mapping green urban areas using satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument. The methods are tested on two cities in Croatia (Varazdin and Osijek). Support vector machines outperform random forest, artificial neural networks, and the naive Bayes classifier in terms of classification accuracy (a Kappa value of 0.87 for Varazdin and 0.89 for Osijek) and performance time.

TI  - Exploring the Role of Intraoperative Frozen Section of the Sentinel Lymph Node in the Management of Early-Staged Oral Tongue Cancers
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The present study aims to explore the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with intraoperative frozen section in the management of early-staged oral tongue cancers. Materials and Methods: Fifty-two patients with clinical stages cT1/2N0 oral tongue cancers were included in the present study. The curative surgery was preceded by the performance of an SLNB using a dual technique. Results: The identification rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in this study was 98.07%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and the negative predictive value (NPV) of SLNB were 88.2%, 100%, 100%, and 94.5%, respectively. Further, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and the NPV of intraoperative frozen section of the SLN were 70.5%, 100%, 100%, and 87.5%, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of intraoperative frozen section could identify 70.5% of patients with occult metastasis. An intraoperative frozen section assessment of sentinel node has the potential to change the overall management of patients with early-oral tongue cancers.

TI  - Allometric relationships for <i>Quercus gambelii</i> and <i>Robinia neomexicana</i> for biomass estimation following disturbance
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southwestern USA, increases in size, frequency, and severity of wildfire are driving the conversion of forests to shrub-dominated ecosystems. Increases in drought extent and severity, coupled with the way that shrub-dominated systems are perpetuated by high-severity fire, predisposes these post-disturbance landscapes to remain in a non-forest condition. Consequently, understanding the distribution of aboveground biomass in post-disturbance, shrub-dominated ecosystems is central to constraining the uncertainty surrounding how these ecosystems interact with light and water to sequester carbon. Here we present allometric regressions for Quercus gambelii (Gambel oak) and Robinia neomexicana (New Mexico locust), two species that dominate post-fire landscapes in the southwestern USA. Our allometric regressions are designed to be driven by either field plot or high-resolution remote sensing data, using either shrub area or shrub volume to estimate biomass.

TI  - The Perceptual Structure of the Poetic Text: On the Terms of the Research
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an analysis of the basic concepts used in modern perceptual linguistic studies with the aim of developing a theoretical and methodological basis for a new direction, in which the phenomenon of perceptiveness is considered in the aspect of text generation. To achieve the aim, in the introduction and in the first part of the article, a brief overview of the main works describing the current state of perceptual linguistics and its separate areas (discursive, linguistic, comparative, experimental, etc.) is made. It is emphasized that perceptiveness must be considered as a factor of text generation and a text category whose expression is directly related to the cultural tradition, the literary trend (direction) and the individual author's worldview. In the second part, key terms of perceptual linguistics used in the analysis of literary texts are identified and described: perceptual unit, perceptual semantics, perceptual picture of the world. Perceptual units are defined as linguistic (lexical and syntactic) means of expression of a perceptual (literary) image. The basis for their classification is the mode of perception: vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste. Special attention is paid to perceptual image as a form of a literary image that receives a specific lexical and grammatical content in the individual author's model of the world. Perceptual image is a "tool" for analyzing literary perceptiveness. In the third, main part of the article, the necessity of introducing the term perceptual structure of a poetic text into scientific discourse is substantiated, and its status is determined. It is stated that perceptual structure implies the actualization of the functional and stylistic aspect of the expression of perceptual semantics in a text. The concept of perceptual structure is defined as follows: (1) it is a set of perceptual units of different text levels that represent the individual author's perceptual picture of the world and are analyzed in the aspect of text generation; (2) it is a system of aesthetically significant perceptual images (in their interaction and interdependence) that form the literary space of a text and are conditioned by the cultural tradition, the literary trend (direction) and the individual author's worldview. The results indicate that the introduction of the term perceptual structure of a poetic text will: (1) present literary perceptiveness as a complex semantic structure in which all elements are in a relationship of interconnection and interdependence; (2) update the text-generating function of perceptual units of different levels of a text; (3) use additional tools in the philological analysis of a text.

TI  - Mapping global impervious surface area and green space within urban environments
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of impervious surface area (ISA) and urban green space (UGS) is essential for improving the urban environmental quality toward ecological, livable, and sustainable goals. Currently, accurate ISA and UGS products are lacking in urban areas at the global scale. This study established regression models that estimated the fraction of ISA/UGS in global 30 cities for validation using MODIS NDVI and DMSP/OLS nighttime light imageries. A global dataset of ISA and UGS fraction with a spatial resolution of 250 mx250 m was developed using the regression model, with a mean relative error of 0.19 for its ISA. The results showed the global urban area of 76.29x10(4) km(2), which was primarily distributed in central Europe, eastern Asia, and central and eastern North America. The urban land area in North America, Europe, and Asia was 66.3x10(4) km(2), accounting for 86.91% of the world's urban area; the urban land area of the top 50 countries accounted for 59.32% of the total urban land area in the world. The global ISA of 45.26x10(4) km(2) was mainly distributed in central and southern North America, eastern Asia, and Europe, as well as coastal regions around the world. The proportion of ISA situated in built-up areas on the continental scale followed the order of Africa (>70%)>South America>Oceania>Asia (>60%)>North America>Europe (>50%), and these areas were mostly in southeastern North America, southwestern Europe, and eastern and western Asia. North America, Europe, and Asia accounted for 89.44% of the world's total UGS. The cities of developed countries in Europe and North America exposed a dramatic mosaic of ISA and UGS composites in urban construction. Therefore, the proportion of UGS is relatively high in those cities. However, in developing and underdeveloped countries, the proportion of UGS in built-up areas is relatively low, and urban environments need to be improved for livability.

TI  - PolSAR-Decomposition-Based Extended Water Cloud Modeling for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) remote sensing has been widely used for forest mapping and monitoring. PolSAR data has the capability to provide scattering information that is contributed by different scatterers within a single SAR resolution cell. A methodology for a PolSAR-based extended water cloud model (EWCM) has been proposed and evaluated in this study. Fully polarimetric phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) data of advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) was used in this study for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) retrieval of Dudhwa National Park, India. The shift in the polarization orientation angle (POA) is a major problem that affects the PolSAR-based scattering information. The two sources of POA shift are Faraday rotation angle (FRA) and structural properties of the scatterer. Analysis was carried out to explore the effect of FRA in the SAR data. Deorientation of PolSAR data was implemented to minimize any ambiguity in the scattering retrieval of model-based decomposition. After POA compensation of the coherency matrix, a decrease in the power of volume scattering elements was observed for the forest patches. This study proposed a framework to extend the water cloud model for AGB retrieval. The proposed PolSAR-based EWCM showed less dependency on field data for model parameters retrieval. The PolSAR-based scattering was used as input model parameters to derive AGB for the forest area. Regression between PolSAR-decomposition-based volume scattering and AGB was performed. Without deorientation of the PolSAR coherency matrix, EWCM showed a modeled AGB of 92.90 t ha(-1), and a 0.36 R-2 was recorded through linear regression between the field-measured AGB and the modeled output. After deorientation of the PolSAR data, an increased R-2 (0.78) with lower RMSE (59.77 t ha(-1)) was obtained from EWCM. The study proves the potential of a PolSAR-based semiempirical model for forest AGB retrieval. This study strongly recommends the POA compensation of the coherency matrix for PolSAR-scattering-based semiempirical modeling for forest AGB retrieval.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the thermal properties of Koycegiz Lake using in-situ measurements and satellite based thermal infrared imagery. In-situ measurements of surface water temperature and water depth, as well as meteorological data, were used in the analysis. Images of the Landsat 8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared (IR) Sensors) at IR channels were taken from the data archives of United State Geological Survey (USGS), and were validated with surface in-situ measurements. Specific Electrical conductivity (SEC) measurements done at the bottom of the lake were also used for a better understanding of the water thermal stratification and types (cold/hot) that impact on the underwater physical properties of the lake. In-situ measurements at the water surface were interpolated using a new method known as 'Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK)'. The 2D and 3D (dimensional) temperature maps were generated using the Delaunay triangulation technique which utilizes nearest neighbor interpolation method. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R-2) between water surface temperatures (WST) from in-situ measurements and IR channels is found to be greater than 0.86. The analysis of 2D and 3D temperature mapping of the lake water revealed evidences for subaqueous cold spring occurrence in the northern part and subaqueous hot springs in the south-western part of Koycegiz Lake. It is concluded that correlating in-situ water temperature measurements to Landsat 8 TIRS images is an efficient method for temporal and spatial evaluation of lake water characteristics.

TI  - Time Series GIS Map Dataset of Demolished Buildings in Mashiki Town after the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After a large-scale disaster, many damaged buildings are demolished and treated as disaster waste. Though the weight of disaster waste was estimated two months after the 2016 earthquake in Kumamoto, Japan, the estimated weight was significantly different from the result when the disaster waste disposal was completed in March 2018. The amount of disaster waste generated is able to be estimated by an equation by multiplying the total number of severely damaged and partially damaged buildings by the coefficient of generated weight per building. We suppose that the amount of disaster waste would be affected by the conditions of demolished buildings, namely, the areas and typologies of building structures, but this has not yet been clarified. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use geographic information system (GIS) map data to create a time series GIS map dataset with labels of demolished and remaining buildings in Mashiki town for the two-year period prior to the completion of the disaster waste disposal. We used OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the base data and time series SPOT images observed in the two years following the Kumamoto earthquake to label all demolished and remaining buildings in the GIS map dataset. To effectively label the approximately 16,000 buildings in Mashiki town, we calculated an indicator that shows the possibility of the buildings to be classified as the remaining and demolished buildings from a change of brightness in SPOT images. We classified 5701 demolished buildings from 16,106 buildings, as of March 2018, by visual interpretation of the SPOT and Pleiades images with reference to this indicator. We verified that the number of demolished buildings was almost the same as the number reported by Mashiki municipality. Moreover, we assessed the accuracy of our proposed method: The F-measure was higher than 0.9 using the training dataset, which was verified by a field survey and visual interpretation, and included the labels of the 55 demolished and 55 remaining buildings. We also assessed the accuracy of the proposed method by applying it to all the labels in the OSM dataset, but the F-measure was 0.579. If we applied test data including balanced labels of the other 100 demolished and 100 remaining buildings, which were other than the training data, the F-measure was 0.790 calculated from the SPOT image of 25 March 2018. Our proposed method performed better for the balanced classification but not for imbalanced classification. We studied the examples of image characteristics of correct and incorrect estimation by thresholding the indicator.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral disaster led to the almost complete loss of the Aral Sea. After the construction of the Kokaral dam in 2005, it became possible to rescue the northern part of the Aral Sea (the Little Aral). Due to natural (climatic) and anthropogenic causes, the flow of the Syr Darya River increased in the beginning of the 21st century, its hydrological regime changed dramatically, spring-summer floods decreased, and winter discharges significantly increased. All of these changes strongly affected the dynamics of floodplain ecosystems and landscapes. A comprehensive assessment of current trends in the dynamics of ecosystems and landscapes under changing environmental conditions was attempted in the study. The study was carried out based on field material with data from remote sensing of the Sentinel 2 satellite, as well as climatic and hydrological materials. The office and field data were analyzed according to the developed methodology developed by Zh.V. Kuzmina and S.E. Treshkin for the assessment of transformations in ecosystems and landscapes from natural and hydrotechnical disturbances. The main trends were established as follows: hydromorphic saline formation for the second floodplain level of the river valley; a gradual decrease in the groundwater level, accompanied by a gradual increase in soil salinization with depth and the absence of strong salinization at the top for interstream delta depressions; the withdrawal of the territories from the flood regime without increased soil salinization for the third floodplain level and floodplain terrace; the substitution of a typical perennial grass stand due to its freezing and damping on an annual small weed grass due to winter discharges for the depressions of the first and second levels of the floodplain.

AB  - Background: Incident reporting system (IRS) deepens the understanding of the frequency of adverse events and near misses. Voluntary reporting is an essential step to improve patient safety.Objectives: The study aimed to apply an efficient and reliable system for incident reporting to enhance patient safety practices in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs).Methods: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study design was conducted to implement a voluntary anonymous IRS in PICUs. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 health care personnel. A tailored educational program was provided to 73 health care personnel. A questionnaire was administered before and three months after the intervention to assess their attitude towards incident reporting.Results: The interviewed health care providers highlighted that no IRS was established in the PICUs and most of them never reported any event unless it was a sentinel event. They agreed that an IRS would be beneficial to PICUs. The average percentage of positive responses for "Frequency of error reporting' increased significantly from 23.8% to 42%. Communication problems, hygienic errors, therapeutic errors, and diagnostic errors accounted for 34%, 32%, 29%, and 5% of the reported potential errors, respectively.Conclusions: IRS implementation improves potential error reporting attitude and practice in PICUs.

TI  - A Synergistic Use of a High-Resolution Numerical Weather Prediction Model and High-Resolution Earth Observation Products to Improve Precipitation Forecast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean region is frequently struck by severe rainfall events causing numerous casualties and several million euros of damages every year. Thus, improving the forecast accuracy is a fundamental goal to limit social and economic damages. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are currently able to produce forecasts at the km scale grid spacing but unreliable surface information and a poor knowledge of the initial state of the atmosphere may produce inaccurate simulations of weather phenomena. The STEAM (SaTellite Earth observation for Atmospheric Modelling) project aims to investigate whether Sentinel satellites constellation weather observation data, in combination with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations, can be used to better understand and predict with a higher spatio-temporal resolution the atmospheric phenomena resulting in severe weather events. Two heavy rainfall events that occurred in Italy in the autumn of 2017 are studied-a localized and short-lived event and a long-lived one. By assimilating a wide range of Sentinel and GNSS observations in a state-of-the-art NWP model, it is found that the forecasts benefit the most when the model is provided with information on the wind field and/or the water vapor content.

TI  - Detection of Geothermal Potential Zones Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition towards a new sustainable energy model-replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources-presents a multidisciplinary challenge. One of the major decarbonization issues is the question of to optimize energy transport networks for renewable energy sources. Within the range of renewable energies, the location and evaluation of geothermal energy is associated with costly processes, such as drilling, which limit its use. Therefore, the present research is aimed at applying different geomatic techniques for the detection of geothermal resources. The workflow is based on free/open access geospatial data. More specifically, remote sensing information (Sentinel-2A and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)), geological information, distribution of gravimetric anomalies, and geographic information systems have been used to detect areas of shallow geothermal potential in the northwest of the province of Orense, Spain. Due to the variety of parameters involved, and the complexity of the classification, a random forest classifier was employed, since this algorithm works well with large sets of data and can be used with categorical and numerical data. The results obtained allowed identifying a susceptible area to be operated on with a geothermal potential of 80 W.m(-1) or higher.

TI  - Towards protein production and application by using <i>Chlorella</i> species as circular economy
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, productions of microalgal proteins were explored via a circular economy concept. First, production of proteins from Chlorella vulgaris FSP-E (CV) and Chlorella sorokiniana (CS) was optimized by using favorable cultivation conditions and strategies. The optimal CO2 concentration for the growth of both microalgae was 5% (v/v), while the optimal nitrogen source for CV and CS were 12 mM of NaNO3 and NH4Cl, respectively. Addition of 12 mg/L ammonium iron (III) citrate enhanced protein production. Next, semi-batch cultivation strategy was employed to achieve a protein production of 793.3 and 812.8 mg/L for CV and C S, representing a 4.86 and 2.77 fold increase, respectively, in protein productivity. The obtained microalgal proteins consist of 40% essential amino acids. The CV and CS proteins possess prebiotic activities as they enhanced the growth of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ZY by 48 and 74%, respectively, with a good antibacterial activity against predominant pathogens.

TI  - Evaluation of Approaches for Mapping Tidal Wetlands of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent and vegetation characteristics of tidal wetlands and their change are among the biggest unknowns and largest sources of uncertainty in modeling ecosystem processes and services at the land-ocean interface. Using a combination of moderate-high spatial resolution (<= 30 meters) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, we evaluated several approaches for mapping and characterization of wetlands of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Sentinel-1A, Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), PALSAR-2, Sentinel-2A, and Landsat 8 imagery were used to map wetlands, with an emphasis on mapping tidal marshes, inundation extents, and functional vegetation classes (persistent vs. non-persistent). We performed initial characterizations at three target wetlands study sites with distinct geomorphologies, hydrologic characteristics, and vegetation communities. We used findings from these target wetlands study sites to inform the selection of timeseries satellite imagery for a regional scale random forest-based classification of wetlands in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Acquisition of satellite imagery, raster manipulations, and timeseries analyses were performed using Google Earth Engine. Random forest classifications were performed using the R programming language. In our regional scale classification, estuarine emergent wetlands were mapped with a producer's accuracy greater than 88% and a user's accuracy greater than 83%. Within target wetland sites, functional classes of vegetation were mapped with over 90% user's and producer's accuracy for all classes, and greater than 95% accuracy overall. The use of multitemporal SAR and multitemporal optical imagery discussed here provides a straightforward yet powerful approach for accurately mapping tidal freshwater wetlands through identification of non-persistent vegetation, as well as for mapping estuarine emergent wetlands, with direct applications to the improved management of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Current Trends in Forest Ecological Applications of Three-Dimensional Remote Sensing: Transition from Experimental to Operational Solutions?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The alarming increase in the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of changes in composition, structure and function of forest ecosystems during recent years calls for enhanced cross-border mitigation and adaption measures, which strongly entail intensified research to understand the underlying processes in the ecosystems as well as their dynamics. Remote sensing data and methods are nowadays the main complementary sources of synoptic, up-to-date and objective information to support field observations in forest ecology. In particular, analysis of three-dimensional (3D) remote sensing data is regarded as an appropriate complement, since they are hypothesized to resemble the 3D character of most forest attributes. Following their use in various small-scale forest structural analyses over the past two decades, these sources of data are now on their way to be integrated in novel applications in fields like citizen science, environmental impact assessment, forest fire analysis, and biodiversity assessment in remote areas. These and a number of other novel applications provide valuable material for the Forests special issue "3D Remote Sensing Applications in Forest Ecology: Composition, Structure and Function", which shows the promising future of these technologies and improves our understanding of the potentials and challenges of 3D remote sensing in practical forest ecology worldwide.

TI  - Melanoma nodal management in Ontario the year after the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology and Society of Surgical Oncology guideline
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2012 in the United States, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology (ASCO/SSO) published a joint guideline about indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in cutaneous melanoma. The guideline supported completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for all patients with positive sentinel nodes. We examined the rates and predictors of SLNB and CLND for melanoma patients in Ontario (population 13.6 million) after publication of that guideline.Methods We used the Ontario Cancer Registry to identify patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma in 2013. Patient records were linked to prospectively maintained health administrative databases to obtain details for each patient, including surgical procedures.Results Of the 3298 patients with melanoma identified in Ontario in 2013, 1973 (59.8%) could be analyzed. Most of that group (n = 1227, 62.2%) underwent local excision alone; 746 (37.8%) had a SLNB. The SLNB was performed in 13.9%, 67.8%, 62.6%, and 47.2% of patients with T1, T2, T3, and T4 primary melanomas respectively. In multivariate analysis, receipt of SLNB was positively associated with younger age (<80 years), higher T stage, and a non-head-and-neck primary. Of the patients who had a SLNB, 136 (18.2%) were found to be node-positive. A CLND was performed in 82 of those patients (60.3%).Conclusions In Ontario, only two thirds of patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas (T2, T3) underwent SLNB as recommended by the ASCO/SSO guideline. Use of SLNB was less frequent for patients with a head-and-neck primary and higher for younger patients (<80 years). The rate of CLND after a positive SLNB was also low relative to the guideline recommendation.

TI  - Interdependent effects of climate variability and forest cover change on streamflow dynamics: a case study in the Upper Umvoti River Basin, South Africa
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow dynamics are sensitive to both climate variability and land use change. However, estimating their separate and combined effects remains a research challenge. In South Africa, streamflow dynamics are important not only for irrigated agriculture but also for many rural communities that depend on streamflow for domestic water supply. In this paper, we analysed the effects of pine, wattle and eucalyptus plantation cover change vis-a-vis the effects of inter-annual climate variability on streamflow dynamics of the Upper Umvoti River in South Africa from 1994 to 2016. We modelled inter-annual variability in streamflow by precipitation, temperature and plantation cover using the Bayesian inference. We mapped plantation cover from Landsat satellite imagery. We found strong evidence for an interaction between temperature range and plantation cover net change on streamflow. Specifically, the plantation effect weakened under conditions of high-temperature range anomalies. We explain this interaction with a shift in soil water repellency and interception capacity within the plantation area under a changing temperature range, with important implications for the formation of surface runoff. Previous studies have assumed that the effects of climate variability and plantation cover change on streamflow dynamics are independent. Our results call this assumption into question. Hence, climate and land cover interdependencies should be accounted for in future statistical and process-based modelling studies.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Republic of Korea is very vulnerable to damage from storm and flood due to the rainfall phenomenon in summer and the topography of the narrow peninsula. The damage is recently getting worse because of the concentration rainfall. The accurate damage information production and analysis is required to prepare for future disaster. In this study, we analyzed the water surface area changes of Byeokjeong, Sajeom, Subu and Boryeong using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. The surface area of the Sentinel-1 satellite, taken from May 2015 to August 2019, was preprocessed using RTC and image binarization using Otsu. The water surface area of reservoir was compared with the storage capacity from WAMIS and RIMS. As a result, Subu and Boryeong showed strong correlations of 0.850 and 0.941, respectively, and Byeokjeong and Sajeom showed the normal correlation of 0.651 and 0.657. Thus, SAR satellite imagery can be used to objective data as disaster management.

TI  - Cloud Detection and Restoration of Landsat-8 using STARFM
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellite images have been increasingly used for disaster damage analysis and disaster monitoring because they can be used for periodic and broad observation of disaster damage area. However, periodic disaster monitoring has limitation because of areas having missing data due to clouds as a characteristic of optical satellite images. Therefore, a study needs to be conducted for restoration of missing areas. This study detected and removed clouds and cloud shadows by using the quality assessment (QA) band provided when acquiring Landsat-8 images, and performed image restoration of removed areas through a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion (STARFM) algorithm. The restored image by the proposed method is compared with the restored image by conventional image restoration method throught MLC method. As a results, the restoration method by STARFM showed an overall accuracy of 89.40%, and it is confirmed that the restoration method is more efficient than the conventional image restoration method. Therefore, the results of this study are expected to increase the utilization of disaster analysis using Landsat satellite images.

TI  - MODIS Aqua Reflective Solar Band Calibration for NASA's R2018 Ocean Color Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing ocean color products have stringent requirements on radiometric calibration stability. To address a calibration deficiency in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua in recent years, the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) developed a new calibration for reflective solar bands. Prior to the reprocessing of NASA's ocean color products for 2018 (R2018), the OBPG MODIS products had been based on calibration provided by the MODIS Calibration Support Team (MCST). Several modifications were made to the MCST calibration approach to improve the calibration accuracy for ocean color products. These include (1) applying 936-nm detector normalization to solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) data to reduce coherent noise; (2) modeling solar diffuser (SD) degradation wavelength dependency to determine SD degradation in near-infrared and shortwave infrared wavelengths; (3) computing detector gains using SD screen-closed data to better match ocean radiance levels in all bands; (4) performing a simple atmospheric correction to reduce bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects in desert trends; (5) estimating and using modulated relative spectral response (RSR) impact on ocean data to adjust the calibration coefficients; (6) using smoothing to characterize the temporal change in calibration; and characterizing response versus scan angle (RVS) changes using 2nd-order polynomials to improve spatial/temporal calibration stability. Relative to the previous R2014 ocean color products, the R2018 calibration removed the suspect late-mission global trends in blue-band water-leaving reflectance and some anomalously large short-term variability (spikes) in the temporal trend of chlorophyll concentration. This paper will describe the OBPG calibration with a focus on the differences between the MCST and OBPG approaches.

TI  - Detection and Assessment of Forest Cover Change in Gangwon Province, Inter-Korean, Based on Gaussian Probability Density Function
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2018 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report announced that deforestation in North Korea is the most extreme situation and in terms of climate change, this deforestation is a global scale issue. To respond deforestation, various study and projects are conducted based on remote sensing, but access to public data in North Korea is limited, and objectivity is difficult to be guaranteed. In this study, the forest detection based on density estimation in statistic using Landsat imagery was conducted in Gangwon province which is the only administrative district divided into South and North. The forest spatial data of South Korea was used as data for the labeling of forest and Non-forest in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and a threshold (0.6658) for forest detection was set by Gaussian Probability Density Function (PDF) estimation by category. The results show that the forest area decreased until the 2000s in both Korea, but the area increased in 2010s. It is also confirmed that the reduction of forest area on the local scale is the same as the policy direction of urbanization and industrialization at that time. The Kappa value for validation was strong agreement (0.8) and moderate agreement (0.6), respectively. The detection based on the Gaussian PDF estimation is considered a method for complementing the statistical limitations of the existing detection method using satellite imagery. This study can be used as basic data for deforestation in North Korea and Based on the detection results, it is necessary to protect and restore forest resources.

TI  - Introducing WIW for Detecting the Presence of Water in Wetlands with Landsat and Sentinel Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many wetlands are characterized by a vegetation cover of variable height and density over time. Tracking spatio-temporal changes in inundation patterns of these wetlands remains a challenge for remote sensing. Water In Wetlands (WIW) was predicted using a dichotomous partitioning of reflectance values encoded based on ground-truth (n = 4038) and optical-space derived (n = 7016) data covering all land cover types (n = 17) found in the Rhone delta, southern France. The models were developed with spectral data from Sentinel 2, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 sensors, hence providing a monitoring tool that covers a 35-year period (same sensor for Landsat 5 and 7). A single model combining the near infrared (NIR <= 0.1558 to 0.1804, depending on sensors) and short-wave infrared (SWIR2 <= 0.0871 to 0.1131) wavelengths was identified by three independent analyses, each one using a different satellite. Overall accuracy of water maps ranged from 89% to 94% for the training samples and from 90% to 94% for the validation samples, encompassing standard water indices that systematically underestimate flooding duration under vegetation cover. Sentinel 2 provided the highest performance with a kappa coefficient of 0.82 for both samples. Such tool will be most useful for monitoring the water dynamics of seasonal wetlands, which are particularly sensitive to climate change while providing multiple services to humankind. Considering the high temporal resolution of Sentinel 2 (every 5 days), cumulative water maps built with the WIW logical rule could further be used for mapping a wide range of wetlands which are either periodically or permanently flooded.

TI  - The Potential of Open Geodata for Automated Large-Scale Land Use and Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the potential of open geodata sets and multitemporal Landsat satellite data as the basis for the automated generation of land use and land cover (LU/LC) information at large scales. In total, six openly available pan-European geodata sets, i.e., CORINE, Natura 2000, Riparian Zones, Urban Atlas, OpenStreetMap, and LUCAS in combination with about 1500 Landsat-7/8 scenes were used to generate land use and land cover information for three large-scale focus regions in Europe using the TimeTools processing framework. This fully automated preprocessing chain integrates data acquisition, radiometric, atmospheric and topographic correction, spectral-temporal feature extraction, as well as supervised classification based on a random forest classifier. In addition to the evaluation of the six different geodata sets and their combinations for automated training data generation, aspects such as spatial sampling strategies, inter and intraclass homogeneity of training data, as well as the effects of additional features, such as topography and texture metrics are evaluated. In particular, the CORINE data set showed, with up to 70% overall accuracy, high potential as a source for deriving dominant LU/LC information with minimal manual effort. The intraclass homogeneity within the training data set was of central relevance for improving the quality of the results. The high potential of the proposed approach was corroborated through a comparison with two similar LU/LC data sets, i.e., GlobeLand30 and the Copernicus High Resolution Layers. While similar accuracy levels could be observed for the latter, for the former, accuracy was considerable lower by about 12-24%.

TI  - The Long-Term Impairment in Redox Homeostasis Observed in the Hippocampus of Rats Subjected to Global Perinatal Asphyxia (PA) Implies Changes in Glutathione-Dependent Antioxidant Enzymes and TIGAR-Dependent Shift Towards the Pentose Phosphate Pathways: Effect of Nicotinamide
T2  - NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We have recently reported that global perinatal asphyxia (PA) induces a regionally sustained increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels and GSSG/GSH ratio, a decrease in tissue-reducing capacity, a decrease in catalase activity, and an increase in apoptotic caspase-3-dependent cell death in rat neonatal brain up to 14 postnatal days, indicating a long-term impairment in redox homeostasis. In the present study, we evaluated whether the increase in GSSG/GSH ratio observed in hippocampus involves changes in glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, the enzymes reducing glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and hydroperoxides, respectively, as well as catalase, the enzyme protecting against peroxidation. The study also evaluated whether there is a shift in the metabolism towards the penthose phosphate pathway (PPP), by measuring TIGAR, the TP53-inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator, associated with delayed cell death, further monitoring calpain activity, involved in bax-dependent cell death, and XRCC1, a scaffolding protein interacting with genome sentinel proteins. Global PA was induced by immersing fetus-containing uterine horns removed by a cesarean section from on term rat dams into a water bath at 37 degrees C for 21 min. Asphyxia-exposed and sibling cesarean-delivered fetuses were manually resuscitated and nurtured by surrogate dams. Animals were euthanized at postnatal (P) days 1 or 14, dissecting samples from hippocampus to be assayed for glutathione, GR, GPx (all by spectrophotometry), catalase (Western blots and ELISA), TIGAR (Western blots), calpain (fluorescence), and XRCC1 (Western blots). One hour after delivery, asphyxia-exposed and control neonates were injected with either 100 mu l saline or 0.8 mmol/kg nicotinamide, i.p., shown to protect from the short- and long-term consequences of PA. It was found that global PA produced (i) a sustained increase of GSSG levels and GSSG/GSH ratio at P1 and P14; (ii) a decrease of GR, GPx, and catalase activity at P1 and P14; (iii) a decrease at P1, followed by an increase at P14 of TIGAR levels; (iv) an increase of calpain activity at P14; and (v) an increase of XRCC1 levels, but only at P1. (vi) Nicotinamide prevented the effect of PA on GSSG levels and GSSG/GSH ratio, and on GR, GPx, and catalase activity, also on increased TIGAR levels and calpain activity observed at P14. The present study demonstrates that the long-term impaired redox homeostasis observed in the hippocampus of rats subjected to global PA implies changes in GR, GPx, and catalase, and a shift towards PPP, as indicated by an increase of TIGAR levels at P14.

TI  - Using MODIS Land Surface Temperatures for Permafrost Thermal Modeling in Beiluhe Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to monitor the ground temperature over large areas to understand and predict the effects of climate change on permafrost due to its rapid warming on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter for the energy budget of permafrost environments. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products are especially valuable for detecting permafrost thermal dynamics across the QTP. This study presents a comparison of MODIS-LST values with in situ near-surface air temperature (T-a), and ground surface temperature (GST) obtained from 2014 to 2016 at five sites in Beiluhe basin, a representative permafrost region on the QTP. Furthermore, the performance of the thermal permafrost model forced by MODIS-LSTs was studied. Averaged LSTs are found to strongly correlated with T-a and GST with R-2 values being around 0.9. There is a significant warm bias (4.43-4.67 degrees C) between averaged LST and T-a, and a slight warm bias (0.67-2.66 degrees C) between averaged LST and GST. This study indicates that averaged MODIS-LST is supposed to be a useful data source for permafrost monitoring. The modeled ground temperatures and active-layer thickness have a good agreement with the measurements, with a difference of less than 1.0 degrees C and 0.4 m, respectively.

TI  - Integration of ZiYuan-3 Multispectral and Stereo Data for Modeling Aboveground Biomass of Larch Plantations in North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data saturation in optical sensor data has long been recognized as a major factor that causes underestimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) for forest sites having high AGB, but there is a lack of suitable approaches to solve this problem. The objective of this research was to understand how incorporation of forest canopy features into high spatial resolution optical sensor data improves forest AGB estimation. Therefore, we explored the use of ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite imagery, including multispectral and stereo data, for AGB estimation of larch plantations in North China. The relative canopy height (RCH) image was calculated from the difference of digital surface model (DSM) data at leaf-on and leaf-off seasons, which were extracted from the ZY-3 stereo images. Image segmentation was conducted using eCognition on the basis of the fused ZY-3 multispectral and panchromatic data. Spectral bands, vegetation indices, textural images, and RCH-based variables based on this segment image were extracted. Linear regression was used to develop forest AGB estimation models, where the dependent variable was AGB from sample plots, and explanatory variables were from the aforementioned remote-sensing variables. The results indicated that incorporation of RCH-based variables and spectral data considerably improved AGB estimation performance when compared with the use of spectral data alone. The RCH-variable successfully reduced the data saturation problem. This research indicated that the combined use of RCH-variables and spectral data provided more accurate AGB estimation for larch plantations than the use of spectral data alone. Specifically, the root mean squared error (RMSE), relative RMSE, and mean absolute error values were 33.89 Mg/ha, 29.57%, and 30.68 Mg/ha, respectively, when using the spectral-only model, but they become 24.49 Mg/ha, 21.37%, and 20.37 Mg/ha, respectively, when using the combined model with RCH variables and spectral band. This proposed approach provides a new insight in reducing the data saturation problem.

TI  - Diurnal and intra-season variation of warm-season temperature in coastal zone of Qinghai Lake
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai Lake is the largest saltwater lake in the Tibetan Plateau and in mainland China. Effects of the lake on surface climate of the coastal areas, however, are not well understood. This article utilizes hourly observation data of warm season from 17 automatic weather stations to analyze the diurnal and seasonal variations in air temperature in different coastal zones of the Qinghai Lake. The EOS/MODIS data was also used to analyze the surface temperature differences between the lake and its surrounding areas. The results show a few unique characteristics of the plateau lake: (1) based on the satellite data, lake surface temperature is lower than its surrounding areas (4.925.1 degrees C and 12.235.6 degrees C respectively) in the daytime, while it is obviously higher than that in the surrounding areas (1.910.5 degrees C and - 13.16.3 degrees C respectively) at the nighttime. Daily mean water surface temperature is higher than that in the surrounding areas, which is 7.817.9 degrees C and - 2.617.9 degrees C respectively; (2) based on data of meteorological stations, coastal zones closer to the shoreline have a higher air temperature during the warm season largely due to the much warmer nighttime near the shoreline than those in deep inland zones. For the on-shore, near-shore, and far-shore zones, mean daytime air temperature is 8.79.6 degrees C, 9.511.1 degrees C, and 10.010.7 degrees C, respectively, and the mean nighttime air temperature is 2.94.1 degrees C, 1.312.3 degrees C, and - 0.20.4 degrees C respectively. The hourly mean diurnal temperature range (DTR) increases with distance to the shoreline, which is 8.6 degrees C, 10.9 degrees C, and 12.3 degrees C in the on-shore, near-shore, and far-shore zones respectively; (3) differences between maximum and minimum 5-day mean daily maximum (minimum) air temperature during the warm season are 20.3 degrees C (23.3 degrees C), 21.7 degrees C (25.6 degrees C), and 22.6 degrees C (26.7 degrees C) for the on-shore, near-shore, and far-shore zones, respectively, indicating an asymmetrical effect on daytime and nighttime air temperature in the on-shore zone; (4) daily maximum air temperature of the on-shore zone is lower before early October, but it is slightly higher afterward and occurs later; (5) daily minimum air temperature of the on-shore zone is on average higher than that of the far-shore zone, especially after the mid-September, and it also appears later in autumn than in summer.

TI  - Comparison of the MuSyQ and MODIS Collection 6 Land Surface Temperature Products Over Barren Surfaces in the Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, to improve the accuracy of land surface temperature (LST) products over barren surfaces, we present an operational algorithm to retrieve the LST from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared data using physically retrieved emissivity products. The LST algorithm involved two steps. First, the emissivity in the two MODIS split-window (SW) channels was estimated using the vegetation cover method, with the bare soil component emissivity derived from the ASTER global emissivity data set. Then, the LST was retrieved using a modified generalized SW algorithm. This algorithm was implemented in the MUlti-source data SYnergized Quantitative (MuSyQ) remote sensing product system. The MuSyQ MODIS LST product and the Collection 6 MODIS LST product (MxD11_L2) were compared and validated using ground measurements collected from four barren surface sites in Northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment from June 2012 to December 2015. In total, 2268 and 2715 clear-sky samples were used in the validation for Terra and Aqua, respectively. The evaluation results indicate that the MuSyQ LST products provide better accuracy than the C6 MxD11 product during both daytime and nighttime at all four sites. For the daytime results, the LST is underestimated by the C6 MxD11 products at all four sites, with a mean bias of -1.78 and -2.86 K and a mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.16 and 3.94 K for Terra and Aqua, respectively, whereas the mean biases of the MuSyQ LST products are within 1 K, with a mean bias of -0.26 and -1.03 K and a mean RMSE of 2.45 and 2.71 K for Terra and Aqua, respectively. For the nighttime results, the LST is also underestimated by the C6 MxD11 products at all four sites, with a mean bias of -1.60 and -1.26 K and a mean RMSE of 1.93 and 1.60 K for Terra and Aqua, respectively, whereas the mean biases of the MuSyQ LST products are 0.16 and 0.58 K and the mean RMSEs are 1.12 and 1.25 K for Terra and Aqua, respectively. The results indicate that the underestimation of the C6 MxD11 LST product at all four sites mainly results from the overestimation of the emissivities in MODIS bands 31 and 32. This study demonstrates that physically retrieved emissivity products are a useful source for LST retrieval over barren surfaces and can be used to improve the accuracy of global LST products.

TI  - Adaptive bathymetry estimation for shallow coastal waters using Planet Dove satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric mapping of shallow waters (above 15 m) is essential for a wide range of scientific research, government, transport, and industry globally. Satellite-based bathymetry estimation approaches offer an alternative to traditional shipborne measurements, especially given advancements in their spatial and temporal resolution of satellite imagery, including the new Planet Dove constellation of > 150 satellites providing daily coastal coverage. Dove satellites provide abundant cloud-free images even over cloudy tropical coastal environment, offering an opportunity to generate frequent bathymetry maps at high spatial resolution (4 m). We developed a new adaptive bathymetry estimation algorithm for Planet Dove and similar satellites. The algorithm adaptively tunes a depth estimator according to water column attenuation conditions. The algorithm was tested at five diverse reef sites globally (Lighthouse Reef, Belize; Saona Island, Dominican Republic; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Heron Island, Australia; Hawaii Island, U.S.) using 31 satellite images from six Dove satellites. Derived water depth was validated (RMSE = 1.22 to 1.86 m) with field-measured sampling points (61,025) ranging in depth from 1 to 15 m. Algorithm performance was best at depths of 4-10 m. This new adaptive algorithm can be effectively applied to derive high spatial resolution bathymetric maps from Planet Dove satellite imagery across a wide range of conditions.

TI  - Error Budget in the Validation of Radiometric Products Derived from OLCI around the China Sea from Open Ocean to Coastal Waters Compared with MODIS and VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) estimated from ocean color imagery through the atmospheric correction step is essential in conducting quantitative estimates of the inherent optical properties and biogeochemical parameters of seawater. Therefore, finding the main source of error is the first step toward improving the accuracy of R-rs. However, the classic validation exercises provide only the total error of the retrieved R-rs. They do not reveal the error sources. Moreover, how to e ffectively improve this satellite algorithm remains unknown. To better understand and improve various aspects of the satellite atmospheric correction algorithm, the error budget in the validation is required. Here, to find the primary error source from the OLCI R-rs, we evaluated the OLCI R-rs product with in-situ data around the China Sea from open ocean to coastal waters and compared them with the MODIS-AQUA and VIIRS products. The results show that the performances of OLCI are comparable to those MODIS-AQUA. The average percentage difference (APD) in R-rs is lowest at 490 nm (18%), and highest at 754 nm (79%). A more detailed analysis reveals that open ocean and coastal waters show opposite results: compared to coastal waters the satellite R-rs in open seas are higher than the in-situ measured values. An error budget for the three satellite-derived R-rs products is presented, showing that the primary error source in the China Sea was the aerosol estimation and the error on the Rayleigh-corrected radiance for OLCI, as well as for MODIS and VIIRS. This work suggests that to improve the accuracy of Sentinel-3A in the coastal waters of China, the accuracy of aerosol estimation in atmospheric correction must be improved.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in a Highly Turbid Eutrophic Lake Using a Classification-Based MODIS Land-Band Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the coarse spatial resolution and saturation issues associated with the 1-km ocean bands of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instruments, the higher resolution (250 and 500 m) land bands are tended to be used for water color applications in coastal and inland waters. However, these wide spectral bands provide limited spectral information; therefore, resolving the chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) signal in highly turbid waters poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present a classification-based algorithm to estimate Chla in a highly turbid eutrophic lake, Taihu Lake in Eastern China, using four visible to near-infrared land bands of MODIS observations. A threshold segmentation method ofMODIS R-rs(555)/R-rs(645) was used to categorize the lake into two classes: Chla-dominated waters (Class 1) and suspended particulate matter (SPM)-dominated waters (Class 2). Then, a band ratio of R-rs(859)/R-rs (645) was applied to retrieve Chla in Class 1, and a newly proposed spectral index, theAnti-SPM Chlorophyll-a Index (ASCI), was used to estimate Chla in Class 2. Validation using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method showed that the average unbiased relative error (AURE) of the derived Chla is 44.4%, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) is 0.55. The algorithm was further applied toMODIS data of Taihu Lake between 2000 and 2015 to obtain Chla time series maps, whose spatial and temporal patterns agreed well with previous studies.

TI  - Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Tea Plantations Using High-Spatiotemporal-Resolution Imagery in Northern Zhejiang, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea plantations are widely distributed in the southern provinces of China and have expanded rapidly in recent years due to their high economic value. This expansion has caused ecological problems such as soil erosion, and it is therefore urgent to clarify the spatial distribution and area of tea plantations. In this study, we developed a simple method to accurately map tea plantations based on their unique phenological characteristics observed from VEN mu S high-spatiotemporal-resolution multispectral imagery. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red-green ratio index (RGRI) of time series were calculated using 40 VEN mu S images taken in 2018 to evaluate the phenology of tea plantations. The unique phenological period of tea plantations in northern Zhejiang is from April to May, with obvious deep pruning, which is very different from the phenological period of other vegetation. During this period, the RGRI values of tea plantations were much higher than those of other vegetation such as broadleaf forest and bamboo forest. Therefore, it is possible to identify tea plantations from the vegetation in images acquired during their phenological period. This method was applied to tea plantation mapping in northern Zhejiang. The NDVI value of the winter image was used to extract a vegetation coverage map, and spatial intersection analysis combined with maps of tea plantation phenological information was performed to obtain a tea plantation distribution map. The resulting tea plantation map had a high accuracy, with a 94% producer accuracy and 95.9% user accuracy. The method was also applied to Sentinel-2 images at the regional scale, and the obtained tea plantation distribution map had an accuracy of 88.7%, indicating the good applicability of the method.

TI  - The effects of urban land cover composition and structure on land surface temperature in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land cover composition and structure directly affect land surface temperature (LST) and urban heat island intensity, which has become a main focus of urban planning and urban ecology. Taking Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang as study areas, urban land cover and LST were extracted and retrieved from Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing images, respectively. Various geospatial approaches, including urban-rural gradient analysis, multi-scale analysis and landscape pattern index, were used to analyze the impacts of urban land cover characteristics on LST. The results showed that the area of impervious surface area (ISA) in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang was 1103.86, 610.33, and 326.75 km(2), respectively. LST of bare soil was the highest, followed by ISA and green vegetation (GV), and that of water body was the lowest. The ISA ratio (positively) and GV ratio (negatively) significantly correlated with LST along the urban rural gradient. LST would decrease by 0.4-0.6 C with an 10% increase of GV. With the increase of spatial analysis scale, the correlations between the proportion of urban ISA and GV and LST first rised and then stabilized. The patch size, shape and aggregation of urban ISA and GV all had significant effects on LST, with the aggregation having the strongest effect. Thus, urban GV plays an important role in urban heat mitigation. We suggest that reasonable layout and ratio of ISA and GV in urban planning should be implemented to improve urban ecosystem services and environmental quality of human settlement.

TI  - A Correction Method for Thermal Deformation Positioning Error of Geostationary Optical Payloads
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geometric positioning of a remote sensing image is one of the core technologies for the quantitative application of the geostationary satellite data. Affected by the change of the incident angle of the sunlight, the spatial thermal environment surrounding the remote sensing cameras (RSCs), especially the geostationary RSCs, fluctuates greatly and has a noticeable impact on the installation matrix based on the reference to the satellite body. Therefore, the spatial thermal environment will ultimately influence the camera's geometric positioning model and the final positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a novel correction method based on stellar observations for correcting geometric positioning error caused by spatial thermal deformation (STD) of geostationary optical payloads. The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks associated with current stabilization methods that involve shutting down the camera to reduce STD effects. Experimental results show that the positioning error corrected by the proposed method can be within +/- 1.9 pixels (2 sigma) at a 95% confidence level and better than the +/- 18 pixels before correction.

TI  - Spatial Resolution Matching of Microwave Radiometer Data with Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive multi-frequency microwave remote sensing is often plagued with the problems of low- and non-uniform spatial resolution. In order to adaptively enhance and match the spatial resolution, an accommodative spatial resolution matching (ASRM) framework, composed of the flexible degradation model, the deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN), and the adaptive feature modification (AdaFM) layers, is proposed in this paper. More specifically, a flexible degradation model, based on the imaging process of the microwave radiometer, is firstly proposed to generate suitable datasets for various levels of matching tasks. Secondly, a deep residual CNN is introduced to jointly learn the complicated degradation factors of the data, so that the resolution can be matched up to fixed levels with state of the art quality. Finally, the AdaFM layers are added to the network in order to handle arbitrary and continuous resolution matching problems between a start and an end level. Both the simulated and the microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data from the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite have been used to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - Deriving High-Resolution Reservoir Bathymetry From ICESat-2 Prototype Photon-Counting Lidar and Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of reservoir bathymetry is essential for many studies on terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical processes. However, there are currently no cost-effective approaches to derive reservoir bathymetry at the global scale. This study explores the potential of generating high-resolution global bathymetry using elevation data collected by the 532-nm Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2). The novel algorithm was developed and tested using the ICESat-2 airborne prototype, the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), with Landsat-based water classifications (from 1982 to 2017). MABEL photon elevations were paired with Landsat water occurrence percentiles to establish the elevation-area (E-A) relationship, which in turn was applied to the percentile image to obtain partial bathymetry over the historic dynamic range of reservoir area. The bathymetry for the central area was projected to achieve the full bathymetry. The bathymetry image was then embedded onto the digital elevation model (DEM). Results were validated over Lake Mead against survey data. Results over four transects show coefficient of determination (R-2) values from 0.82 to 0.99 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values from 1.18 to 2.36 m. In addition, the E-A and elevation-storage (E-S) curves have RMSEs of 1.56 m and 0.08 km(3), respectively. Over the entire dynamic reservoir area, the derived bathymetry agrees very well with independent survey data, except for within the highest and lowest percentile bands. With abundant overpassing tracks and high spatial resolution, the newly launched ICESat-2 should enable the derivation of bathymetry over an unprecedented number of reservoirs.

TI  - Urban Flood Mapping Using SAR Intensity and Interferometric Coherence via Bayesian Network Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations are widely used in emergency response for flood mapping and monitoring. However, the current operational services are mainly focused on flood in rural areas and flooded urban areas are less considered. In practice, urban flood mapping is challenging due to the complicated backscattering mechanisms in urban environments and in addition to SAR intensity other information is required. This paper introduces an unsupervised method for flood detection in urban areas by synergistically using SAR intensity and interferometric coherence under the Bayesian network fusion framework. It leverages multi-temporal intensity and coherence conjunctively to extract flood information of varying flooded landscapes. The proposed method is tested on the Houston (US) 2017 flood event with Sentinel-1 data and Joso (Japan) 2015 flood event with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data. The flood maps produced by the fusion of intensity and coherence and intensity alone are validated by comparison against high-resolution aerial photographs. The results show an overall accuracy of 94.5% (93.7%) and a kappa coefficient of 0.68 (0.60) for the Houston case, and an overall accuracy of 89.6% (86.0%) and a kappa coefficient of 0.72 (0.61) for the Joso case with the fusion of intensity and coherence (only intensity). The experiments demonstrate that coherence provides valuable information in addition to intensity in urban flood mapping and the proposed method could be a useful tool for urban flood mapping tasks.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of Soil Salinity in a Semiarid Oasis: Environmental Sensitive Variable Selection and Model Comparison
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely monitoring and early warning of soil salinity are crucial for saline soil management. Environmental variables are commonly used to build soil salinity prediction model. However, few researches have been done to summarize the environmental sensitive variables for soil electrical conductivity (EC) estimation systematically. Additionally, the performance of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Random Forest regression (RFR) model, the representative of current main methods for soil EC prediction, has not been explored. Taking the north of Yinchuan plain irrigation oasis as the study area, the feasibility and potential of 64 environmental variables, extracted from the Landsat 8 remote sensed images in dry season and wet season, the digital elevation model, and other data, were assessed through the correlation analysis and the performance of MLR, GWR, and RFR model on soil salinity estimation was compared. The results showed that: 1) 10 of 15 imagery texture and spectral band reflectivity environmental variables extracted from Landsat 8 image in dry season were significantly correlated with soil EC, while only 3 of these indices extracted from Landsat 8 image in wet season have significant correlation with soil EC. Channel network base level, one of the terrain attributes, had the largest absolute correlation coefficient of 0.47 and all spatial location factors had significant correlation with soil EC. 2) Prediction accuracy of RFR model was slightly higher than that of the GWR model, while MLR model produced the largest error. 3) In general, the soil salinization level in the study area gradually increased from south to north. In conclusion, the remote sensed imagery scanned in dry season was more suitable for soil EC estimation, and topographic factors and spatial location also play a key role. This study can contribute to the research on model construction and variables selection for soil salinity estimation in arid and semiarid regions.

TI  - Understanding Dynamics of Mangrove Forest on Protected Areas of Hainan Island, China: 30 Years of Evidence from Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals requires countries to determine targets for the protection, conservation, or restoration of coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests by 2030. Satellite remote sensing provides historical and current data on the distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests, essential baseline data that are needed to design suitable policy interventions. In this study, Landsat time series were used to map trends and dynamics of mangrove change over a time span of 30 years (1987-2017) in protected areas of Hainan Island (China). A support vector machine algorithm was combined with visual interpretation of imagery and result showed alternating periods of expansion and loss of mangrove forest at seven selected sites on Hainan Island. Over this period, there was a net decrease in mangrove area of 9.3%, with anthropic activities such as land conversion for aquaculture, wastewater disposal and discharge, and tourism development appearing to be the likely drivers of this decline in cover. Long-term studies examining trends in land use cover change coupled with assessments of drivers of loss or gain enable the development of evidence based on policy and legislation. This forms the basis of financing of natural reserves of management and institutional capacity building, and facilitates public awareness and participation, including co-management.

TI  - Surgery on breast cancer in pregnancy
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is defined as breast cancer develops either during or within 1 year after pregnancy, it is a rare disease arising in 1:3,000 to 1:10,000 pregnant women. Prognosis of this tumor is influenced by local or systemic treatment, which might be conditioned by gestational age and limited by the concern on potential adverse impact on fetus. The aim of this literature review is to analyze the main topics regarding surgical treatment of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in pregnancy: anesthesia and maternal-fetal monitoring, type of breast surgery, immediate breast reconstruction after radical surgery and management of the axilla. Some important topics remain controversial since the relative rarity of PABC precludes the feasibility of large studies leading to a lack of literature data. Multi-institutional collaboration is warranted to collect women with PABC, in order to best define surgical treatment in view of associated maternal and fetal risks.

TI  - Ambient Particulate Matter Exposure and Under-Five and Maternal Deaths in Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian region is one of the major emission sources of air pollution. Although ambient PM2.5 has been linked to several health risks in high-, low-, and middle-income countries, the further analysis of type impact is still rare but significant. The PM2.5 distribution retrieved from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) aerosol optical depth products within 16 years thus explored the associations between under-five and maternal mortality for 45 countries in Asia. Both the nonparametric (Generalized Additive Mixed-Effect) and parametric (Generalized Linear Mixed-Effect) models were employed to analyze the collected datasets. The results show that the levels of PM2.5 in Asian sub-regions were higher than the Global Air Quality Standards. Biomass PM2.5 concentrations was associated with increased the rate of under-five (Incidence Rate Ratio, IRR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.13-1.47) and maternal (IRR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.08-1.10) deaths in Asia. Anthropogenic PM2.5 was associated with increased rate of under-five deaths in Asia by 12%. The nonparametric method revealed that dust PM2.5 was positively associated with the under-five (beta = 0.04, p < 0.001) and maternal (beta = 0.07, p < 0.001) deaths in Asia. The rate of maternal deaths was increased by biomass/dust (IRR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.63-1.65) and anthropogenic/dust (IRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.19-1.26) mixture types. In summary, long-term exposure to different types of ambient PM2.5 in high concentration increased the rate of under-five and maternal deaths, suggesting that policies focusing on preventive and control measures is imperative for developing an improved maternal, newborn, and child health in Asia.

TI  - Crop Yield Estimation Using Time-Series MODIS Data and the Effects of Cropland Masks in Ontario, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the estimation of grain yields of three major annual crops in Ontario (corn, soybean, and winter wheat) using MODIS reflectance data extracted with a general cropland mask and crop-specific masks. Time-series two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was derived from the 8 day composite 250 m MODIS reflectance data from 2003 to 2016. Using a general cropland mask, the strongest positive linear correlation between crop yields and EVI2 was observed at the end of July to early August, whereas a negative correlation was observed in spring. Using crop-specific masks, the time of the strongest positive linear correlation for winter wheat was found between mid-May and early June, corresponding to peak growth stages of the crop. EVI2 derived at peak growth stages of a crop provided good predictive capability for grain yield estimation, with considerable inter-annual variation. A multiple linear regression model was established for county-level yield estimation using EVI2 at peak growth stages and the year as independent variables. The model accounted for the spatiotemporal variability of grain yields of about 30% and 47% for winter wheat, 63% and 65% for corn, and 59% and 64% for soybean using the general cropland mask and crop-specific masks, respectively. A negative correlation during the spring indicated that vegetation index extracted using a general cropland mask should be used with caution in regions with mixed crops, as factors other than the growth conditions of the targeted crops may also be captured by remote sensing data.

TI  - Evaluation of MWHS-2 Using a Co-located Ground-Based Radar Network for Improved Model Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate precipitation detection is one of the most important factors in satellite data assimilation, due to the large uncertainties associated with precipitation properties in radiative transfer models and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. In this paper, a method to achieve remote sensing of precipitation and classify its intensity over land using a co-located ground-based radar network is described. This method is intended to characterize the O-B biases for the microwave humidity sounder -2 (MWHS-2) under four categories of precipitation: precipitation-free (0-5 dBZ), light precipitation (5-20 dBZ), moderate precipitation (20-35 dBZ), and intense precipitation (>35 dBZ). Additionally, O represents the observed brightness temperature (TB) of the satellite and B is the simulated TB from the model background field using the radiative transfer model. Thresholds for the brightness temperature differences between channels, as well as the order relation between the differences, exhibited a good estimation of precipitation. It is demonstrated that differences between observations and simulations were predominantly due to the cases in which radar reflectivity was above 15 dBZ. For most channels, the biases and standard deviations of O-B increased with precipitation intensity. Specifically, it is noted that for channel 11 (183.31 +/- 1 GHz), the standard deviations of O-B under moderate and intense precipitation were even smaller than those under light precipitation and precipitation-free conditions. Likewise, abnormal results can also be seen for channel 4 (118.75 +/- 0.3 GHz).

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inversion models for retrieving the total and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns from spaceborne remote sensing data are presented. For total column retrieval, we propose the so-called differential radiance models with internal and external closure and solve the underlying nonlinear equations by using the method of Tikhonov regularization and the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method. For tropospheric column retrieval, we design a nonlinear and a linear model by using the results of the total column retrieval and the value of the stratospheric NO2 column delivered by a stratosphere-troposphere separation method. We also analyze the fundamentals of the commonly used differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) model and outline its relationship to the proposed inversion models. By a numerical analysis, we analyze the accuracy of the inversion models to retrieve total and tropospheric NO2 columns.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, extensive marshlands had been converted to paddy fields in the Sanjiang Plain, China; however, the effect of this land use change on ecosystem carbon budget is still much uncertainty. Valuation has been proved to have a great role for carbon budget characterizing directly. This study assessed carbon budget changes based on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration before and after marshlands conversion to paddy fields. By remote sensing data interpretation, the area of marshlands converted to paddy fields between 1982 and 2010 was 1.31 x 10(5) ha at ArcGIS 10.2.1 software environment. We used the ecosystem carbon sequestration and the total greenhouse gas emissions to analyze ecosystem carbon budget, and found that carbon budget of marshlands before conversion (37.75 x 10(6) t CO(2)eq) was significantly higher than that of their converted into paddy fields (22.31 x 10(6) t CO(2)eq) in the Sanjiang Plain, with the loss of 15.44 x 10(6) t CO(2)eq. By carbon tax payment, we further assessed that the economic loss of carbon budget caused by the marshlands conversion in the Sanjiang Plain was up to 8.64 x 10(8) Yuan. It can provide the reference for wetland ecosystem especially ecosystem service conservation.

TI  - Landscape Pattern Changes in the Xingkai Lake Area, Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding landscape change is important for ecologically sustainable development. In this paper, we assessed the spatiotemporal variations of landscape pattern in the Xingkai Lake area using remote sensing data from 1982, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Landscape patterns of marshlands, paddy fields, dry farmlands, and their combinations were analyzed at class and landscape levels. We examined the stability of landscape types through principal component analysis based on class level indices for landscape types. The results indicated that marshland areas decreased significantly by 33.87% but paddy fields increased by 1.84 times from 1982 to 2015. The largest conversion of dry farmlands to paddy fields was 90.88 km(2) during the period 2010-2015. In contrast, the largest conversion of paddy fields to dry farmlands was 86.03 km(2) during the period 2000-2005. The difference in relative change revealed that dry farmlands had experienced a greater relative change than paddy fields since 2000. The interspersion and juxtaposition index decreased, while the number of patches grew. This showed that landscape fragmentation was increasing and the landscape pattern was becoming dispersed. Marshlands were more stable than paddy fields and dry farmlands across all time periods, except for the year 2005.

TI  - Monitoring Groundwater Change in California's Central Valley Using Sentinel-1 and GRACE Observations
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The San Joaquin Valley and Tulare basins in California's Central Valley have intensive agricultural activity and groundwater demand that has caused significant subsidence and depletion of water resources in the past. We measured groundwater pumping-induced land subsidence in the southern Central Valley from March 2015 to May 2017 using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The InSAR measurements provided fine spatial details of subsidence patterns and displayed a superposition of secular and seasonal variations that were coherent across our study region and correlated with precipitation variability and changes in freshwater demand. Combining InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, precipitation, and in situ well records showed a broad scale slowdown/cessation of long term subsidence in the wetter winter of 2017, likely reflecting the collective response of the Central Valley aquifer system to heavier-than-usual precipitation. We observed a very good temporal correlation between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite groundwater anomaly (GWA) variation and long-term subsidence records, regardless of local hydrogeology and mechanical properties. This indicates the subsidence from satellite geodesy is a very useful indicator for tracking groundwater storage change. With the continuing acquisition of Sentinel-1 and other satellites, we anticipate decadal-scale subsidence records with a spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of meters will be available in the near future to be combined with basin-averaged GRACE measurements to improve our estimate of time-varying groundwater change.

TI  - Satellite data integration for soil clay content modelling at a national scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil clay content is a key parameter that influences many other soil properties and processes. The potential of adding new and contemporary satellite data for soil property mapping in France is assessed in this study. The soil property maps used for this analysis were produced within the framework of GlobalSoilMap, which was created to deliver global fine grids of soil properties and associated uncertainties using existing soil information and ancillary data to predict these properties based on digital soil mapping techniques. In this study, we evaluate the added value of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V), and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for predicting the soil clay content at 90 m resolution for mainland France. The rationale behind adding these data is that satellite images and derived products may enable the biogeo-chemical characteristics of the earth's surface to be captured more effectively, which in turn enables more precise predictions of the soil clay content. For this methodology, we i) create composite bare soil mosaics and derive the spectral indices from S2 data acquired during sowing periods from 2016 to 2017, ii) extract the first three principal components of harmonized MODIS and PROBA-V normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series acquired in 2003 and 2016 to represent vegetation changes, and iii) test whether the complementary datasets are able to improve the soil clay information compared to a benchmark value. The soil clay content is obtained by using quantile regression forest (QRF) for each GlobolSoilMap depth interval of 0-5 cm, 5-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-60 cm, 60-100 cm, and 100-200 cm along with a 10-fold cross-validation having 10 replicates. The results show that the complementary satellite data improve the clay content estimation on bare soil for the topsoil layers (e.g., 0-30 cm) by increasing the R-2 and decreasing the bias at averages of 0.05 and 1 g kg(-1), respectively. Moreover, the first principal component of the harmonized NDVI data is shown to be the second most important variable for estimating the clay content, as indicated by the QRF models. However, the use of only the satellite data and products as input for the QRF does not yield a satisfactory estimate of the clay content. Finally, this work provides a reference for embedding new remote sensing data in existing national soil inventories and national soil information systems. Further research should incorporate new techniques for considering the spatial-temporal variability of the earth's surface parameters such as soil moisture and roughness.

This study presents a novel approach of optimized hot spot analysis (OHSA) on persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS), and evaluates its performance on detection of landslides across the Volterra area in central Tuscany region of Italy. 1625 ascending and 2536 descending PS processed from eight years (2003-2010) of ENVISAT images were produced by the PS-InSAR technique. In addition, 16,493 ascending and 9746 descending PS/DS measurement points (MP) processed from four years (2011-2014 for ascending orbits and 2010-2013 for descending orbits) of COSMO-SkyMed images were collected by the SqueeSAR approach. The OHSA approach was then implemented on the derived PS and DS through the analysis of incremental spatial autocorrelation and the Getis-Ord G(i)* statistics. As a result of OHSA, PS and DS MP that are statistically significant with velocity >vertical bar +/- 2 mm/year, p-value < 0.01 and z-score >vertical bar +/- 2.58 were recognized as hot spots (HS). Meanwhile, a landslide inventory covering the Volterra area was manually prepared as the reference data for accuracy assessment of landslide detection. The results indicate that, in terms of OHSA-derived ENVISAT HS, the detection accuracy can be improved from 23.3% to 25.3% and from 50.7% to 66.4%, with decreased redundancy from 5.3% to 3.7% and from 5.3% to 2.4%, for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. In addition, for OHSA-derived Cosmo-SkyMed HS, the detection accuracy can be improved from 57.7% to 70.3% and from 73.8% to 81.5%, with decreased redundancy from 3.1% to 1.7% and from 3.4% to 2.1%, for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. Compared to traditional HS analysis such as Persistent Scatterers Interferometry Hot Spot and Cluster Analysis (PSI-HCA), OHSA has the significant advantage that the scale distance used for the Getis-Ord G(i)* statistics can be automatically determined by the analysis of incremental spatial autocorrelation and accordingly no manual intervention or additional digital terrain model (DTM) is further needed. The proposed method is very succinct and can be easily implemented in diverse geographic information system (GIS) platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that OHSA has been applied to PS and DS.

TI  - Toward Ensemble Assimilation of Hyperspectral Satellite Observations with Data Compression and Dimension Reduction Using Principal Component Analysis
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based hyperspectral radiometers usually have thousands of infrared channels that contain atmospheric state information with higher vertical resolution compared to observations from traditional sensors. However, the large numbers of channels can lead to computational burden in satellite data retrieval and assimilation. Furthermore, most of the channels are highly correlated and the pieces of independent information contained in the hyperspectral observations are usually much smaller than the number of channels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used in this research to compress the observational information content contained in the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) channels to a few leading principal components (PCs). The corresponding PC scores were then assimilated into a PCA-based ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) system. In this proof-of-concept study based on simulated observations, hyperspectral brightness temperatures were simulated using the atmospheric state vectors from convection-permitting ensemble simulations of Hurricane Harvey (2017) as input to the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM). The PCs were derived from a preexisting training dataset of brightness temperatures calculated from convection-permitting simulation over a large domain in the Indian Ocean representing generic atmospheric conditions over tropical oceans. The EnKF increments from assimilating many individual measurements in the brightness temperature space were compared to the EnKF increments from assimilating significantly fewer numbers of leading PCs. Results showed that assimilating about 10-20 leading PCs could yield increments that were nearly indistinguishable to that from assimilating hyperspectral measurements from orders of magnitude larger number of hyperspectral channels.

TI  - Effects of Live Fuel Moisture Content on Wildfire Occurrence in Fire-Prone Regions over Southwest China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a crucial driver affecting wildfire occurrence worldwide, but the effect of LFMC in driving wildfire occurrence still remains unexplored over the southwest China ecosystem, an area historically vulnerable to wildfires. To this end, we took 10-years of LFMC dynamics retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) reflectance product using the physical Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) and the wildfire events extracted from the MODIS Burned Area (BA) product to explore the relations between LFMC and forest/grassland fire occurrence across the subtropical highland zone (Cwa) and humid subtropical zone (Cwb) over southwest China. The statistical results of pre-fire LFMC and cumulative burned area show that distinct pre-fire LFMC critical thresholds were identified for Cwa (151.3%, 123.1%, and 51.4% for forest, and 138.1%, 72.8%, and 13.1% for grassland) and Cwb (115.0% and 54.4% for forest, and 137.5%, 69.0%, and 10.6% for grassland) zones. Below these thresholds, the fire occurrence and the burned area increased significantly. Additionally, a significant decreasing trend on LFMC dynamics was found during the days prior to two large fire events, Qiubei forest fire and Lantern Mountain grassland fire that broke during the 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 fire seasons, respectively. The minimum LFMC values reached prior to the fires (49.8% and 17.3%) were close to the lowest critical LFMC thresholds we reported for forest (51.4%) and grassland (13.1%). Further LFMC trend analysis revealed that the regional median LFMC dynamics for the 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 fire seasons were also significantly lower than the 10-year LFMC of the region. Hence, this study demonstrated that the LFMC dynamics explained wildfire occurrence in these fire-prone regions over southwest China, allowing the possibility to develop a new operational wildfire danger forecasting model over this area by considering the satellite-derived LFMC product.

TI  - [Remote sensing extraction method of Codonopsis pilosula planting area in Weiyuan county].
T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Due to the large amount of Codonopsis pilosula planted in Weiyuan county,and the arable land area,the local medicinal materials office uses a large amount of manpower,financial resources and material resources to estimate its area every year. In order to extract the information of local Chinese medicinal materials more quickly and simply,we try to apply remote sensing technology to the extraction of Chinese medicinal materials. This paper will use Weiyuan county of Gansu province as the research area,and use the domestic ZY-3 Satellite multi-spectral remote sensing image as the data source to find out the spectral characteristics of the party's participation in other remote sensing images. The visual interpretation method was used to extract the planting area of the C. pilosula in Weiyuan county. The estimated value of the planting area of C. pilosula using satellite remote sensing technology was 75 965 mu( 1 mu667 m2),which was basically consistent with the field survey data of the local medicinal materials office. After the accuracy verification,it was found that the precision of C. pilosula planted by visual interpretation was more than 70%. It is concluded that the satellite remote sensing technology can be used to extract the information of C. pilosula and it can provide the relevant information of the planting area of Chinese medicinal materials quickly and accurately.

TI  - Remotely sensing large- and small-scale ground subsidence: A case study of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world's largest city cluster, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is vulnerable to significant subsidence. The widely distributed sediments and rapid urbanization in the GBA result in the concurrence of large- and small-scale subsidence. Mono-sensor synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images usually suffer from the limitation of either low resolution or small coverage, and thus, are not applicable to completely monitoring the GBA. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 (S1), COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) images jointly to reveal multi-scale subsidence of the GBA. The overall subsidence ranged from 0 to 112.3 mm/yr derived from the 2015-2017 S1 images. Three regional subsidence bowls (Zhuhai-Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Guangzhou-Zhongshan) formed in the western alluvial plain. The high correlation between regional subsidence and Quaternary sediments confirms that sediment consolidation is the main cause of subsidence. The land use and numerical modeling results suggest that groundwater extraction and artificial loading are the triggering factors. Two representative local subsidence cases were analyzed using high-resolution images: reclamation settlement at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and sinkhole subsidence due to the excavation of the Shenzhen Wenbo skyscraper foundation pit. The validation at the HKIA showed that the measurements from the CSK and S1 data both agreed well with the leveling data. However, CSK outperformed S1 in the sense that it increased the point density by a factor of 5, improved the height precision by a factor of 4, and showed fewer false alarms. CSK is therefore more applicable to monitoring the local subsidence of key infrastructures. The cross-heading tracks of TSX and CSK images detected precursory subsidence before the sinkhole collapse from two sides, indicating that the cross-heading tracks benefit the comprehensive monitoring of local subsidence in high-rise and high-density built environments. In summary, the synergistic use of multi-sensor SAR images demonstrates the practicability of the operational surveillance of multi-scale subsidence from regional surveying to the fine monitoring of local areas in the GBA.

TI  - Regional Atmospheric Aerosol Pollution Detection Based on LiDAR Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol is one of the major factors that cause environmental pollution. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an effective remote sensing tool for aerosol observation. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the aerosol pollution from the physical perspective, this study investigated regional atmospheric aerosol pollution through the integration of measurements, including LiDAR, satellite, and ground station observations and combined the backward trajectory tracking model. First, the horizontal distribution of atmospheric aerosol wa obtained by a whole-day working scanning micro-pulse LiDAR placed on a residential building roof. Another micro-pulse LiDAR was arranged at a distance from the scanning LiDAR to provide the vertical distribution information of aerosol. A new method combining the slope and Fernald methods was then proposed for the retrieval of the horizontal aerosol extinction coefficient. Finally, whole-day data, including the LiDAR data, the satellite remote sensing data, meteorological data, and backward trajectory tracking model, were selected to reveal the vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics of aerosol pollution and to provide some evidence of the potential pollution sources in the regional area. Results showed that the aerosol pollutants in the district on this specific day were mainly produced locally and distributed below 2.0 km. Six areas with high aerosol concentration were detected in the scanning area, showing that the aerosol pollution was mainly obtained from local life, transportation, and industrial activities. Correlation analysis with the particulate matter data of the ground air quality national control station verified the accuracy of the LiDAR detection results and revealed the effectiveness of LiDAR detection of atmospheric aerosol pollution.

TI  - Estimating water levels and volumes of lakes dated back to the 1980s using Landsat imagery and photon-counting lidar datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, in-situ data and the time duration of altimeter data are limitations in calculating the water level and water volume of lakes and reservoirs from remotely sensed data. A novel method is proposed to estimate the temporal change in water levels and water volumes for lakes with only remotely sensed data. First, the surface profiles, including the ground and the underwater bottom, were extracted from the MABEL (Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar) photon-counting lidar raw data via a new surface detecting algorithm. Second, the lake boundaries between land and water in different years were identified using a thresholding method based on the annual median Landsat composite. Third, water levels were calculated by matching the lidar surface profiles with the lake boundaries based on the nearby georeferenced coordinates. Finally, the water volumes in different years were estimated via the contours (i.e., lake boundaries) with different elevations. Lake Mead was selected as the study area, which is the largest reservoir in the United States in terms of water capacity. With only one day measuring lidar points in February 2012 and over 20 years of Landsat images (from 1987 to 2007), the water levels and water volumes in different years were estimated and compared with the in-situ data. Our results performed well in accordance with the in-situ measurements; the R-square of the water levels and water volumes were both over 0.99; the RMSE of the interannual variations of water levels and water volumes were 0.96 m and 0.31 km(3), respectively. The MABEL was used as a technology demonstrator for the satellite photon-counting laser altimeter and had similar data to the ICESat-2 dataset. Future ICESat-2 datasets will broaden this method to estimate water volumes for remote lakes from the 1980s, where no in-situ data are available (such as the Tibetan Plateau and polar regions with thousands of remote and wild lakes), which could not be achieved in previous studies.

TI  - Identifying the factors and status of land degradation in a tropical plateau region
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The systematic decline of land quality due to the mismatch between land quality and land use is called land degradation. It is the consequences of different physical factors but accelerated by human activities. The processes and factors of land degradation are different in different morpho-climatic regions of the world. Present study is primarily concerned in identifying the factors and status of land degradation in a tropical plateau region. Tropical plateaus are one of the most water erosion related land degraded areas of world. Chotanagpur plateau in tropical eastern India is one of the vulnerable soil degraded areas of the tropical environment. The Precambrian geological formation, undulating topography, immature soil, increasing aridity sets natural settings for land degradation in tropical plateau areas. However, induced degradation results from inappropriate land use, clearance of forest land and heavy land pressure related anthropogenic factors accelerates the processes of land degradation. Kangsabati River basin of eastern Chotanagpur plateau bears all of the above characteristics has been taken for present study as a degraded tropical plateau region. Water erosion and vegetal degradation are the major factors of land degradation in Kangsabati basin. The physical factors responsible for land degradation in the studied area includes physiographic formations, edaphic maturity, hydrologic characteristics, and vegetation cover dynamics etc. This land degradation processes is accelerated by different anthropogenic factors like, land use land cover dynamics, deforestation, agricultural pressure. Multispectral remote sensing data, digital elevation data, thematic maps, recorded climatological data, secondary data and field observation have been utilised to understand the different factors of land degradation in a typical tropical plateau region. The less developed soil profile over Precambrian geology with undulated landforms causes high soil erosion in upper plateau proper regions of the basin. High agricultural pressure, forest and groundwater decline with associated land use land cover dynamics creates decline of land quality in lower basin regions of tropical plateau. The varying intensities of land degraded areas for the basin has been identified through the multiplication of different physical and anthropogenic factor overlaying rasters in GIS environment. Before multiplying, each of these input factor rasters has assigned with weightage after considerable importance of land degradation. The lower basin area with accelerated human interference is the most vulnerable land degraded area for the Kangsabati River basin.

TI  - COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REGULATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FOR SANITARY PROTECTION OF WATER FACILITIES IN UKRAINE BY EU DIRECTIVES: ECOLOGICAL AND HYGIENIC, ARCHITECTURAL-PLANNING AND LEGAL ASPECTS.
T2  - Georgian medical news
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In modern conditions, the use and protection of water is an extremely complex problem. The environmental situation of water resources is relevant for all water basins in Ukraine, since most of the surface and groundwater in Ukraine are polluted. The aim of the research was to study the regulatory normatively-legal base of sanitary, ecolocal, water and urban planning legislation in the field of sanitary protection of water objects and establishing its compliance with the requirements of the European Union Directives with the development of measures to resolve issues of concern. Ukraine's international obligations are enshrined in more than 40 global and regional international acts relating to the sanitary protection and use of water resources.The main requirements of the EU Directive (2008/56/EC, 98/83/EC, 2008/105/EC, 2003/35/EC, 2003/4/EC, 2001/42/EC, 2011/92/EC) are already taken into account new laws in force and domestic regulatory documents. However, the regulatory framework of the legislation of Ukraine in the field of sanitary protection of water objects needs to be improved in terms of focusing on new mechanisms of economic regulation, decentralization of power, the introduction of effective monitoring of the ecological status of the Black and Azov Seas, and the implementation of the requirements of the EU Directives: 2006/7/ЄС, 2007/60/ЄС 91/271/ЄЕС, 91/676/ЄЕС and Regulation No648/2004. In order to improve the sanitary-epidemiological state of water resources in Ukraine, their rational use and protection, it is proposed to carry out: an effective state and legal policy in the field of sanitary protection of waters, focused on: the effective implementation of water, environmental, urban planning legislation of Ukraine; optimal coordination of architectural and planning, water-ecological, sanitary-epidemiological aspects and social interests; priority of drinking water supply and water protection measures; implementation of international treaties with a view to the proper legal, sanitary and epidemiological regime of transboundary water objects; implementation of European standards for the quantitative and qualitative status of waters; the formation of an ecological, sanitary and epidemiological worldview among the population.

TI  - Thin Ice Detection in the Barents and Kara Seas Using AMSR2 High-Frequency Radiometer Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed an algorithm for thin ice detection under winter conditions using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) radiometer high-frequency brightness temperature (36 and 89 GHz) L1R swath data, and a method to combine thin ice swath charts to a more reliable daily thin ice chart. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice thickness swath charts were used as reference data for the algorithm development. The algorithm is based on the classification of 36-GHz polarization ratio (PR36) and H-polarization 89-36-GHz gradient ratio (GR3689H) signatures with linear discriminant analysis. We applied an atmospheric correction to the AMSR2 L1R data following established sea ice concentration (SIC) retrieval algorithms. The PR36 and GR8936H signatures were adjusted to a constant air temperature (Ta) before the thin ice detection using an empirical relationship between them and Ta. The maximum thickness of detected thin ice was estimated to be 20 cm. The thin ice detection with the L1R data is conducted only when SIC >= 70% and T-alpha <= -5 degrees C to limit conditions where thick ice may be erroneously detected as thin ice. The thin ice detection algorithm was developed for the Barents and Kara Seas, but it should also be applicable for other Arctic marginal ice zones (MIZs). The daily thin ice chart was validated using an independent set of MODIS daily ice thickness charts. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice was 10% and 32% for vice versa. We demonstrate the use of the daily thin ice chart for monitoring the thin ice fraction in the Barents and Kara Seas.

TI  - Lobular Histology Does Not Predict the Need for Axillary Dissection Among ACOSOG Z0011-Eligible Breast Cancers
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be omitted for women with two or fewer positive sentinel nodes (SLNs) undergoing breast-conservation therapy (BCT). Lobular histology comprises a minority of patients, and applicability to these discohesive cancers has been questioned. Methods From August 2010 to March 2017, patients undergoing BCT for cT1-2N0 cancer with positive SLNs were prospectively managed with ALND for three or more positive SLNs or gross extracapsular extension (ECE). In this study, clinicopathologic characteristics and nodal burden were compared between pure/mixed invasive lobular cancer (ILC) and invasive ductal cancer (IDC) patients. Results Among 813 consecutive patients, 104 (12.8%) had ILC and 709 (87.2%) had IDC. ILC was more often multifocal and low grade, and less frequently had lymphovascular invasion (all p < 0.001). ILC more often had SLN macrometastases (81.7% ILC vs. 69.4% IDC; p = 0.01) and more than 2 mm of ECE (30.8% ILC vs. 19.5% IDC; p = 0.03), but the proportions of cases with three or more positive SLNs were similar in the two groups (14.4% ILC vs. 9.9% IDC; p = 0.2). The ALND procedure was performed for 20 ILC patients (19.2%) compared with 97 IDC patients (13.7%) (p = 0.2). Additional positive nodes were found in 80% of the ILC patients versus 56.7% of the IDC patients (p = 0.09). The ALND and nodal burden rates were similar in the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subset analysis. In the multivariable analysis, lobular histology (p = 0.03) and larger tumors (p = 0.03) were associated with additional positive nodes. During a median follow-up period of 42 months, there were no isolated axillary recurrences. Conclusions Despite a higher proportion of SLN macrometastases and association with more positive nodes at ALND, lobular histology does not predict the need for ALND. ALND is not indicated on the basis of histology among patients otherwise meeting Z0011 criteria.

TI  - An investigation of inversion methodologies to retrieve the leaf area index of corn from C-band SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on the sensitivity of microwave scattering to vegetation canopies have led the researchers to conclude that crop biophysical parameters can be modeled from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter. In this study, we assess different methods of modeling the Leaf Area Index (LAI), an important biophysical indicator of crop productivity, from dual-polarized SAR. Particularly, we evaluate the performance of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) to estimate the LAI of corn using VV and VH backscatter derived from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites over two test sites (Canada and Poland). We tested the performance of four different approaches to invert the WCM. These are: (a) iterative optimization (IO), (b) Look-up table (LUT) search, (c) Support Vector Regression (SVR) and (d) Random Forest Regression (RFR). The accuracy of each inversion was measured by comparing the estimates from the WCM to the LAI of corn measured in-situ. Our results indicated that the inversion of the WCM using the SVR method delivered the best performance, yielding a correlation (r-value) between estimated and measured LAI of 0.92 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.677 m(2) m(-2). The other approaches produced higher errors, with the LUT search resulting in the greatest error (RMSE of 0.977 m(2) m(-2)). This study will be of interest to the agricultural sector as this community works towards developing robust methods for tracking crop productivity from SAR technologies across multiple sites and using data from multiple satellite platforms.

TI  - Urban Growth Dynamics and Changing Land-Use Land-Cover of Megacity Kolkata and Its Environs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal land-use land-cover changes have a long-term impact on urban environments. The present study is based on land-use land-cover changes and urban expansion of megacity Kolkata and its environs over three decades (1991-2018) using multitemporal Landsat data. The study aims to explore and explain the spatio-temporal land-use land-cover change, areal differentiation, spatio-temporal urban growth trajectory and future land-use land-cover prediction with population projection. The spatio-temporal representation found rapid urbanization, i.e. 19% to 57%, exactly three times as in 1991, resulting in significant loss of other than urban/built-up area. Urban trajectory reveals that the expansion mainly occurred in north-east to south-west direction, the zone of both sides of River Hooghly. Areal differentiation map with highest urbanization (3146 ha or UII = 0.64) was identified in the north-north-west part, while least urbanization was identified in the east-north-east direction. On the other hand, this urbanization has grabbed most (i.e. 87%) of the areas within 5-km ring buffer compared to other three ring buffers. Being Kolkata as a traditional city, it has all modern facilities since British rule; as a result, the high population growth and rapid urban expansion were explored in the study. Therefore, urban growth led to radical changes in land-use land-cover, which were witnessed by sharp decreases in sparse vegetation and fallow land. The correlation explained that increasing urbanization has decreased the amount of water body and vegetation. The future prediction graph identified the more horrible picture: the city and its environs will be covered by 67% built-up, while there will be only 3% water body, 14% vegetation and 16% fallow land of the total geographical area with a population (projection) of 28 million in 2051 if it is continued. Such expansion will create a wide range of mismanagement and environmental problems. Hence, the intensive explanation and areal differentiation maps and diagrams prepared using geospatial data will definitely help to understand the urban growth dynamics process and changing form of land-use land-cover and simultaneously decision-making process of the local planners, stakeholders and academicians. Therefore, it also guides to future planning to decrease the adverse effects of urbanization and result in the form of land-use land-cover and makes an eco-friendly megacity as well as sustainable urban development too.

TI  - Linkage of agricultural drought with meteorological drought in different climates of Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the linkage between agricultural drought and meteorological drought, using normalization different vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) for the whole of Iran in four periods of 16 days of late March, April, May, and June between 2000 and 2017. LST and NDVI were obtained from the production of MODIS MOD13A2 and MOD11A2. In the next step, the basic time synchronization of LST and NDVI was performed by the mean of two 8-day LST images and their conversion to 16-day LST for each year. The vegetation health index (VHI) was calculated from the combination of temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation condition index (VCI). Then, Iran's map of standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was calculated on a 12-month timescale for 68 meteorological stations with the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. By using ArcGIS 10.5, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the slope of linear regression were calculated between 12-month SPEI and VHI for all four periods in different climates: hyper dry, dry, semi-dry, semi-humid, and humid. Results showed that the correlation increased when the temperature increased. This increase occurred in dry and hyper-dry climates. As the temperature rose, the slope of the linear regression for 12-month standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) on vegetation health index (VHI) increased. The highest and lowest average effects of the slope were observed in dry and climatic class, respectively. With increasing temperature, the need for water in plants will increase. Hence, there is a direct relation or a positive correlation between temperature and correlation strength and slope effect. Therefore, plants more seriously will face drought stress during the drought period, and this drought stress has a positive correlation with drought intensity. From this study, it was concluded that the highest correlation and the highest slope effect between the 12-month SPEI and VHI happened in the dry climatic class in June.

TI  - Assessment of Hyperspectral Sharpening Methods for the Monitoring of Natural Areas Using Multiplatform Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of cutting-edge geospatial technologies to monitor ecosystems and the development of tailored tools for assessing such natural areas is a fundamental task. In this context, the growing availability of hyperspectral (HS) imagery from satellite and aerial platforms can provide valuable information for the sustainable management of ecosystems. However, in some cases, the spectral richness provided by HS sensors is at the expense of spatial quality. To alleviate this inconvenience, which can be critical to monitor some heterogeneous and mixed natural areas, a number of HS sharpening techniques have been developed to increase the spatial resolution while trying to preserve the spectral content. This image processing field has attracted the interest of the scientific community, and many research studies have been conducted to assess the performance of different HS sharpening algorithms. In the last decade, however, many comparative studies rely upon simulated data. In this work, the challenging application of sharpening methods in real situations using multiplatform or multisensor data is also addressed. Thus, experiments with real data have been conducted, in addition to a thorough assessment of HS sharpening techniques using simulated imagery in scenarios with different spatial resolution ratios and registration errors. In particular, airborne and satellite HS imageries have been pansharpened with drone, orthophotos, and satellite high spatial resolution data evaluating 11 fusion algorithms. After a comprehensive analysis, considering different visual and quantitative quality indicators, the algorithm characteristics have been summarized and the methods with higher performance and robustness have been identified.

TI  - VAR2CSA Serology to Detect <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Transmission Patterns in Pregnancy
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnant women constitute a promising sentinel group for continuous monitoring of malaria transmission. To identify antibody signatures of recent Plasmodium falciparum exposure during pregnancy, we dissected IgG responses against VAR2CSA, the parasite antigen that mediates placental sequestration. We used a multiplex peptide-based suspension array in 2,354 samples from pregnant women from Mozambique, Benin, Kenya, Gabon, Tanzania, and Spain. Two VAR2CSA peptides of limited polymorphism were immunogenic and targeted by IgG responses readily boosted during infection and with estimated half-lives of <2 years. Seroprevalence against these peptides reflected declines and rebounds of transmission in southern Mozambique during 2004-2012, reduced exposure associated with use of preventive measures during pregnancy, and local clusters of transmission that were missed by detection of P falciparum infections. These data suggest that VAR2CSA serology can provide a useful adjunct for the fine-scale estimation of the malaria burden among pregnant women over time and space.

TI  - Multispectral radiometric monitoring of bacterial blight of coffee
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial blight of coffee caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae shows great destructive potential in the main coffee producing regions in Brazil and worldwide. Remote sensing technologies can be used as an inexpensive and effective method to identify and monitor the disease. This study evaluated the potential of the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS multispectral sensor for the spatial and temporal monitoring of coffee (Coffea arabica) affected by the bacterial blight. In a commercial coffee field in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, samples were collected from a grid of 85 points spaced from 35 to 50 m apart. Each sampling point consisted of five plants, being four plants distributed surrounding a central plant. The analyzes of the plant foliage, disease incidence, and disease severity were performed from January to December 2014 and correlated with 15 vegetation indices derived from a time series of 11 multispectral images. The brightness temperature of these images was calculated in order to indicate the area of the field more favorable to the occurrence of the bacterial blight of coffee. Vegetation indices were highly correlated with the incidence (r = 0.76) and severity (r = 0.52) of the disease. The brightness temperature aided in the mapping of areas with optimal temperature conditions for the occurrence of the disease. In general, the study demonstrated the potential of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images to identify and monitor crops affected by the bacterial blight of coffee.

TI  - Dynamics of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Harare, Zimbabwe: A Case Study on the Linkage between Drivers and the Axis of Urban Expansion
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing population growth, the Harare Metropolitan Province has experienced accelerated land use and land cover (LULC) changes, influencing the city's growth. This study aims to assess spatiotemporal urban LULC changes, the axis, and patterns of growth as well as drivers influencing urban growth over the past three decades in the Harare Metropolitan Province. The analysis was based on remotely sensed Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager data from 1984-2018, GIS application, and binary logistic regression. Supervised image classification using support vector machines was performed on Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data combined with the soil adjusted vegetation index, enhanced built-up and bareness index and modified difference water index. Statistical modelling was performed using binary logistic regression to identify the influence of the slope and the distance proximity characters as independent variables on urban growth. The overall mapping accuracy for all time periods was over 85%. Built-up areas extended from 279.5 km(2) (1984) to 445 km(2) (2018) with high-density residential areas growing dramatically from 51.2 km(2) (1984) to 218.4 km(2) (2018). The results suggest that urban growth was influenced mainly by the presence and density of road networks.

TI  - Identifying people with multiple sclerosis in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL-EXPERIMENTAL TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We validated a case definition for multiple sclerosis using a clinical cohort linked with the Manitoba Primary Care Research Network of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, and applied this definition to describe multiple sclerosis epidemiology using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network repository.Methods: We developed candidate case definitions for multiple sclerosis in the Manitoba Primary Care Research Network using diagnoses and medications. We compared these case definitions to multiple sclerosis diagnoses identified by applying a validated definition to population-based administrative data (reference standard 1) and multiple sclerosis diagnoses recorded by the provincial Multiple Sclerosis Clinic (reference standard 2) using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. We applied the preferred case definition to the national Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network dataset.Results: The Manitoba Primary Care Research Network included 160,904 patients. The preferred case definition required >= 2 billing records for multiple sclerosis within 2 years or multiple sclerosis listed as a health condition or >= 1 multiple sclerosis-specific prescription. This definition had a low sensitivity versus administrative (44.25%) and clinic datasets (53.41%) but high specificity versus administrative data (99.95%). Specificity was lower versus clinic data (71.43%), but the positive predictive value was high.Conclusion: We developed a case definition for multiple sclerosis that can be applied to the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network dataset for studies examining primary care of persons with multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Advanced Multibeam Antenna Configurations Based on Reflectarrays: Providing multispot coverage with a smaller number of apertures for satellite communications in the K and Ka bands
T2  - IEEE ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents some recent developments in multiplebeam antennas (MBAs) based on reflectarrays for communication satellites in the Kurz (K) and Kurz-above (Ka) bands. The existing high-throughput satellites commonly employ four reflector antennas to provide cellular coverage that is formed by multiple spot beams in a four-color scheme. Reflectarray antennas are proposed as an attractive solution for the design of novel MBA configurations to produce multispot coverage, with a smaller number of apertures than conventional MBA systems based on reflector technology. Single and dual reflectarray configurations have been considered for the purpose of exploiting their ability to produce independent beams in different polarizations and frequencies.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node selective biopsy in prostate cancer
T2  - ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate the sentinel lymph node selective biopsy (SLNSB) in the staging of Prostate Cancer with Briganti Index > 5 by comparison with extended lymphadenectomy (ePLND) in a prospective longitudinal study.METHODS: SLNSB has been performed in 84 patients, the first 70 by injection of nanocoloids marked with Tc-99m and preoperative SPECT-CT, and in the last 14 with mixed radiotracer (Tc-99(m) + ICG). After laparoscopis removal of sentinel nodes all patients underwent an ePLND.RESULTS: SPECT-CT showed radiotracer deposits outside the territory of the ePLND in 76% of patients and laparoscopic gamma probe in 57%. The median number of sentinel nodes removed was 5.2 with a total average number of lymph nodes removed of 22. In all cases with metastatic nodes (28% in the series) there was at least one positive sentinel node but metastatic sentinel nodes outside of the territory of the ePLND were found in 6/24 patients (25%). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of Tc-99(m) were 100%, 96.07%, 90.47% and 100%, respectively. In 5 out of 14 patients with mixed radiotracer, lymph node involvement was detected. In all of them there was at least one sentinel node affected with Tc-99m, and only 3 showed fluorescence with 100% sensitivity and 100% NPV for Tc-99m and 60% sensitivity and 77.77% NPV for ICG.CONCLUSION: The SLNSB with Tc-99m has a high sensitivity and a VPN of 100%, increasing the identification of lymphatic metastases outside the territory of the ePLND. Fluorescence can facilitate the visualization of the sentinel nodes when they have been previously located by the SPECT-CT although the sensitivity and the NPV of the ICG are lower than that of the Tc-99m.

TI  - Characterization and Trends of Fine Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) Fire Emissions in the Brazilian Cerrado during 2002-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire occurrence is a major disturbance in the Brazilian Cerrado, which is driven by both natural and anthropogenic activities. Despite increasing efforts for monitoring the Cerrado, a biome-scale study for quantifying and understanding the variability of fire emissions is still needed. We aimed at characterizing and finding trends in Particulate Matter with diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) fire emissions in the Brazilian Cerrado using the PREP-CHEM-SRC emissions preprocessing tool and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fires datasets for the 2002-2017 period. Our results showed that, on average, the Cerrado emitted 1.08 Tg year(-1) of PM2.5 associated with fires, accounting for 25% and 15% of the PM2.5 fire emissions in Brazil and South America, respectively. Most of the PM2.5 fire emissions were concentrated in the end of the dry season (August, 0.224 Tg month(-1) and September, 0.386 Tg month(-1)) and in the transitional month (October, 0.210 Tg month(-1)). Annually, 66% of the total emissions occurred over the savanna land cover; however, active fires that were detected in the evergreen broadleaf land cover tended to emit more than active fires occurring in the savanna land cover. Spatially, each 0.1 degrees grid cell emitted, on average, 0.5 Mg km(-2) year(-1) of PM2.5 associated with fires, but the values can reach to 16.6 Mg km(-2) year(-1) in a single cell. Higher estimates of PM2.5 emissions associated with fires were mostly concentrated in the northern region, which is the current agricultural expansion frontier in this biome. When considering the entire Cerrado, we found an annual decreasing trend representing -1.78% of the annual average PM2.5 emitted from fires during the period analyzed, however, the grid cell analysis found annual trends representing +/- 35% of the annual average PM2.5 fire emissions.

TI  - Evaluating Land Use and Land Cover Change in the Gaborone Dam Catchment, Botswana, from 1984-2015 Using GIS and Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change is one of the major driving forces of global environmental change in many developing countries. In this study, LULC changes were evaluated in the Gaborone dam catchment in Botswana between 1984 and 2015. The catchment is a major source of water supply to Gaborone city and its surrounding areas. The study employed Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) using Landsat imagery of 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015. Image classification for each of these imageries was done through supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Six major LULC categories, cropland, bare land, shrub land, built-up area, tree savanna and water bodies, were identified in the catchment. It was observed that shrub land and tree savanna were the major LULC categories between 1984 and 2005 while shrub land and cropland dominated the catchment area in 2015. The rates of change were generally faster in the 1995-2005 and 2005-2015 periods. For these periods, built-up areas increased by 59.8 km(2) (108.3%) and 113.2 km(2) (98.5%), respectively, while bare land increased by 50.3 km(2) (161.1%) and 99.1 km(2) (121.5%). However, in the overall period between 1984 and 2015, significant losses were observed for shrub land, 763 km(2) (29.4%) and tree savanna, 674 km(2) (71.3%). The results suggest the need to closely monitor LULC changes at a catchment scale to facilitate water resource management and to maintain a sustainable environment.

TI  - Combining ddPCR and environmental DNA to improve detection capabilities of a critically endangered freshwater invertebrate
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Isogenus nubecula is a critically endangered Plecoptera species. Considered extinct in the UK, I. nubecula was recently rediscovered (in one location of the River Dee, Wales), after 22 years of absence. In a similar way to many other species of Perlodidae, I. nubecula could be utilised as a bio-indicator, for assessing water quality and health status of a given freshwater system. However, conventional monitoring of invertebrates via kick-sampling, is invasive and expensive (time consuming). Further, such methods require a high level of taxonomic expertise. Here, we compared the traditional kick-sampling method with the use of eDNA detection using qPCR and ddPCR-analyses. In spring 2018, we sampled eDNA from twelve locations on the River Dee. I. nubecula was detected using kick-sampling in five of these locations, three locations using both eDNA detection and kick-sampling and one location using eDNA detection alone - resulting in a total of six known and distinct populations of this critically endangered species. Interestingly, despite the eDNA assay being validated in vitro and in silico, and results indicating high sensitivity, qPCR analysis of the eDNA samples proved to be ineffective. In contrast, ddPCR analyses resulted in a clear detection of I. nubecula at four locations suggesting that inhibition most likely explains the large discrepancy between the obtained qPCR and ddPCR results. It is therefore important to explore inhibition effects on any new eDNA assay. We also highlight that ddPCR may well be the best option for the detection of aquatic organisms which are either rare or likely to shed low levels of eDNA into their environment.

TI  - Wide local excision prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy for primary melanoma of the head and neck
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Previous wide local excision prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may have the potential to disrupt lymphatic channels, thus incorrectly identifying the sentinel node. The purpose of this study was to investigate: (1) regional recurrence rates of prior wide local excision compared to other biopsy techniques and (2) survival outcomes in patients with melanoma of the head and neck. Methods Between the years 2000 and 2016, 391 cases were reviewed with a median follow-up time of 30 months in a large tertiary care center. Biopsy practices included shave, punch, wide local excision, and narrow margin excisional/Mohs, and associations with time to local or regional relapse and death from melanoma were evaluated. Main outcomes included identification of sentinel lymph nodes, overall survival, and melanoma-specific survival. Results Of the 391 patients, biopsy patterns were as follows: 77 (19%) unknown biopsy, 30 (8%) prior wide local excision (WLE), 105 (27%) narrow margin excisional biopsy, 69 (18%) punch biopsy, and 110 (28%) shave biopsy. SLNB was successfully identified in all 30 patients whom had a prior WLE. There were 50 regional recurrences in the neck and 27 local recurrences with the median (IQR) at 1.2 years and 1.0 years, respectively. Multivariable associations of type of prior biopsy, depth of invasion, and nodal status with time to regional recurrence, local recurrence, overall survival, and melanoma-specific survival were not significantly different. Conclusions Sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma of the head and neck can be successfully performed in patients after previous wide local excision.

TI  - Field data on Vegetation Structure and Effects of Human Use of the Dambos Ecosystem in Northern Mozambique
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The data content of this paper is related to the original research article entitled "Vegetation Structure and Effects of Human Use of the Dambo Ecosystem in Northern Mozambique" that was published in the Global Ecology and Conservation. Woody and grass vegetation was inventoried in the dambos wetlands of the Niassa National Reserve (NNR), the largest Protected Area (PA) in Mozambique and the third largest in Africa. The six dambos assessed were selected through Google Earth, MODIS satellite images and exploratory field visits. The selected dambos were surveyed using a two-stage systematic sampling procedure in which woody vegetation was inventoried by means of transects, and the grass was inventoried using quadratic sub-plots laid down within the transects. The woody vegetation survey included the identification of all individuals to the species level, measurement of total height and diameter at breast height (DBH). The grass vegetation survey consisted of measurement of the total height and species identification within sub-plots. Woody vegetation data in this article includes also estimation of total richness, absolute and relative abundance, dominance, frequency, species volume and successional stage of each species in the vertical structure. Estimation of richness and absolute dominance is also presented for the grass vegetation. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Niassa National Reserve (NNR) is the most extensive conservation area in Mozambique and the third largest in Africa, encompassing 42,000 km(2) of endemic miombo vegetation. Dambos wetlands occur within the wooded grassland and grassland vegetation of NNR and provide a wide range of Ecosystem Services (ES), including life support for animal species, regulation of water flow and prevention of soil erosion. It also generates income for the livelihoods of local communities by providing land for agriculture and harvesting of non-timber products. The dynamics of these ecosystems is poorly understood despite the contribution of the dambos to global biodiversity and ES. This research is the first preliminary assessment of the vegetation structure and composition of six dambos within NNR, selected using Google Earth, MODIS satellite images and an exploratory field visit. Field data collection was performed using a two-stage systematic sampling approach, along transect lines of 100 x 10m (0.1 ha), perpendicular to the dambos' flow. Square plots of 0.25 m(2) were established for grass survey within the transects where grass vegetation was measured, counted and identified. Data were analyzed with R software. The sociological position of each species was analyzed with regard to the vertical structure while for horizontal structure, the abundance, dominance, frequency and Importance Value Index (IVI) were determined. In order to understand the differences between dambos, evenness (H) and reciprocal of Simpson's heterogeneity index (Hill's N-2) were calculated. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Cluster Analysis were also used to characterize the surveyed species communities. A total of 58 transects (5.8 ha) and 336 subplots were assessed, recording 110 woody and 73 grass species, respectively. The most common tree species were Vitex doniana, Burkea africana, Syzygium cordatum and Annona senegalensis, while for grass vegetation the most abundant species were Andropogon eucomus and Helictotrichon turgidulum. According to the IVI, the most dominant tree and shrub species were V. doniana, Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, A. senegalensis and S. cordatum. Homogeneity (Hill's N-2 = 18.92) and evenness (H = -4.27) were, on average, low in all dambos. Dambo 2 was the most heterogeneous (Hill's N-2 = 18.21) while dambo 1 was the least heterogeneous (Hill's N-2 = 5.71). Dambo 6 was most equitable (H = -1.35) whereas dambo 2 the least equitable (H = -3.72). Using species abundance and based on PCoA and cluster analysis, four main groups of dambos were identified based mainly on the water gradient, with data variation captured by the first three axes reaching almost 83%. The p-value (0.42), suggested no significant differences between species communities in the dambos, and thus, human disturbances appear not to be enough to modify dambos microenvironment. Accordingly, the results suggest that human activities, at this level, do not necessarily affect the structure and diversity of dambos in the NNR. The results also suggest that the species A. senegalensis, Combretum psidioides, Crossopteryx febrifuga, Protea nitida, P. maprouneifolia and S. cordatum can be used as indicator dambo species in NNR, with high likelihood of occurrence.

TI  - High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity in Coastal Areas Worldwide from Raw Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to obtain high-resolution values of sea surface salinity (SSS) and temperature (SST) in the global ocean by using raw satellite data (i.e., without any band data pre-processing or atmospheric correction). Sentinel-2 Level 1-C Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data is used to obtain accurate SSS and SST information. A deep neural network is built to link the band information with in situ data from different buoys, vessels, drifters, and other platforms around the world. The neural network used in this paper includes shortcuts, providing an improved performance compared with the equivalent feed-forward architecture. The in situ information used as input for the network has been obtained from the Copernicus Marine In situ Service. Sentinel-2 platform-centred band data has been processed using Google Earth Engine in areas of 100 m x 100 m. Accurate salinity values are estimated for the first time independently of temperature. Salinity results rely only on direct satellite observations, although it presented a clear dependency on temperature ranges. Results show the neural network has good interpolation and extrapolation capabilities. Test results present correlation coefficients of 82% and 84% for salinity and temperature, respectively. The most common error for both SST and SSS is 0.4 degrees C and 0.4 PSU. The sensitivity analysis shows that outliers are present in areas where the number of observations is very low. The network is finally applied over a complete Sentinel-2 tile, presenting sensible patterns for river-sea interaction, as well as seasonal variations. The methodology presented here is relevant for detailed coastal and oceanographic applications, reducing the time for data pre-processing, and it is applicable to a wide range of satellites, as the information is directly obtained from TOA data.

TI  - Extending XBAER Algorithm to Aerosol and Cloud Condition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of cloud optical properties for aerosol contaminated water cloud is challenging because of the complexity of physical processes in such situations. Conventionally, cloud optical data products are typically derived, ignoring the aerosol impacts on radiative transfer in the retrieval process. This is potentially a significant source of error. In this paper, the eXtensible Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm has been optimized for the retrieval of aerosol/cloud properties for the aerosol contaminated cloud (ACC) scenarios. This version of XBAER delivers cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER) for ACCs and simultaneously retrieves aerosol optical thickness (AOT). The surface parameterization and aerosol types used in the standard XBAER algorithm have been adapted in this retrieval to account for the ACC conditions. Aerosol types in XBAER for the retrieval of ACC scenarios have been parameterized to comprise weak and strong absorptions. The comparisons of COT, CER, and AOT retrieved using this adapted XBAER algorithm and two new NASA algorithms show good agreements, especially for biomass burning aerosol. The correlation coefficients are >0.9 for AOT, similar to 0.8 for CER, and similar to 0.7 for COT. There is also a good agreement for dust plume contaminated cloud scene. The XBAER derived AOT values for dust aerosols are systematically smaller than the NASA retrieval, but both products have the same spatial distribution patterns. The comparison of COT retrieved using the adapted XBAER algorithm and that retrieved from ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR) measurements shows much better agreement for ACC conditions with high AOT.

TI  - Assessment of Wheat Straw Cover and Yield Performance in a Rice-Wheat Cropping System by Using Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper straw cover information is one of the most important inputs for agroecosystem and environmental modeling, but the availability of accurate information remains limited. However, several remote-sensing (RS)-based studies have provided a residue cover estimation and provided spatial distribution mapping of paddy rice areas in a constant field condition. Despite this, the performance of rice crops with straw applications has received little attention. Furthermore, there are no methods currently available to quantify the wheat straw cover (WSC) percentage and its effect on rice crops in the rice-wheat cropping region on a large scale and a continuous basis. The novel approach proposed in this study demonstrates that the Landsat satellite data and seven RS-based indices, e.g., (i) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (ii) Normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI), (iii) Normalized difference index 5 (NDI5), (iv) Normalized difference index 7 (NDI7), (v) Simple tillage index (STI), (vi) Normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), and (vii) Shortwave red normalized difference index (SRNDI), can be used to estimate the WSC percentage and determine the performance of rice crops over the study area in Changshu county, China. The regression model shows that the NDTI index performed better in differentiating the WSC at sampling points with a coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.80) and root mean squared difference (RMSD = 8.46%) compared to that of other indices, whereas the overall accuracy for mapping WSC was observed to be 84.61% and the kappa coefficient was kappa = 0.76. Moreover, the rice yield model was established by correlating between the peak NDVI values and rice grain yield collected from ground census data, with R-2 = 0.85. The finding also revealed that the highest estimated yield (8439.67 kg/ha) was recorded with 68% WCS in the study region. This study confirmed that the NDVI and NDTI algorithms are very effective and robust indicators. Also, it can be strongly concluded that multispectral Landsat satellite imagery is capable of measuring the WSC percentage and successively determines the impact of different WSC percentages on rice crop yield within fields or across large regions through remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques for the long-term planning of agriculture sustainability in rice-wheat cropping systems.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Compact Polarimetry for Soil Moisture Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a factor for risk analysis in the agricultural sector, yet access to temporally and spatially detailed data is challenging for much of the world's agricultural extend. Significant effort has been focused on developing methodologies to estimate soil moisture from microwave satellite sensors. Canada's RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is capable of acquiring imagery in a number of modes with a Compact Polarimetry (CP) configuration at different spatial resolutions (1 to 100 m). RCM offers greater polarization diversity, wide swaths and improved temporal frequency (4-day exact revisit time); all important considerations for large area monitoring of agricultural resources. The major goal of this study was to examine whether CP could accurately estimate surface soil moisture over bare fields. A methodology was developed using the calibrated Integral Equation Model (IEM) multi-polarization inversion approach. RADARSAT-2 data was acquired between 2012 and 2017 over a test site in eastern Canada. CP backscatter for two RCM modes (medium resolution 30 m and 50 m (MR30 and MR50)) was simulated using 63 RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric images. A simple transfer function was developed between RH (right circular-horizontal) and HH (horizontal-horizontal) intensity, as well as RV (right circular-vertical) and VV (vertical-vertical). These HH- and VV-like intensities were then used in the multi-polarization inversion scheme to retrieve soil moisture. CP soil moisture retrievals were validated against soil moisture measurements from a long term in-situ network instrumented with five soil moisture stations. Retrieved and measured soil moisture were well correlated (R > 0.70) with an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) less than 0.06 m(3)/m(3). Overall, the developed method clearly captured the dry down and wetting trends observed through the five years study period. However, results demonstrated that the inversion method introduced a consistent bias (0.10 m(3)/m(3)). Comparison of CP soil moisture estimates to those from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) passive microwave satellite confirmed this bias. This study demonstrates the potential of C-band CP data to deliver accurate soil moisture products over wide swaths for regional and national soil moisture monitoring.

TI  - Fuzzy Spatio-Spectro-Temporal Ontology for Remote Sensing Image Annotation and Interpretation: Application to Natural Risks Assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research deals with semantic interpretation of Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) using ontologies which are considered as one of the main challenging methods for modeling high-level knowledge, and reducing the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics of an image. In this paper, we propose a new ontology which allows the annotation as well as the interpretation of RSI with respect to natural risks, while taking into account uncertainty of data, object dynamics in natural scenes, and specificities of sensors. In addition, using this ontology, we propose a methodology to (i) annotate the semantic content of RSI, and (ii) deduce the susceptibility of the land cover to natural phenomena such as erosion, floods, and fires, using case-based reasoning supported by the ontology. This work is tested using LANDSAT and SPOT images of the region of Kef which is situated in the north-west of Tunisia. Results are rather promising.

TI  - Fish Communities, Habitat Use, and Human Pressures in the Upper Volta Basin, Burkina Faso, West Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human pressures and loss of natural fish habitats led to a decline in fish populations in terms of abundances, biodiversity, and average size in sub-Sahelian Burkina Faso. Little knowledge exists about fish assemblages regarding their composition, their habitat preferences, or their sensitivity to or tolerance of human pressures. This research provides the first data-driven basis for sustainably managing fish and associated aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Surveys in four different regions sampled 18,000 specimens from 69 species during the dry season. Fish communities, available abiotic habitat conditions, habitat use, and human pressures were assessed and analyzed. Fish communities cluster into four distinct types, each dominated by either Cichlidae, Clariidae, Cyprinidae, or Alestidae and accompanied by specific other families and genera of fish. Habitat preferences of four key species (Labeo coubie, Bagrus bajad, Chelaethiops bibie, and Lates niloticus) were linked to ecological habitat conditions. Results show that physical parameters influence fish community composition and abundances and, when indexed according to pressure type, are linked to responses in fish metrics. Relative abundance either dropped (Mormyridae) or increased (Cichlidae, Cyprinidae) with rising pressure intensity, and some sentinel taxa (Auchenoglanis, Hydrocynus) were only found in low-pressure sites. The outcomes of this study provide basic knowledge of habitat availability, habitat use by fish, species associations, and human pressures and therefore provide the basis for effective conservation and management of fish populations.

TI  - Can palm date plantations and oasification be used as a proxy to fight sustainably against desertification and sand encroachment in hot drylands?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using GIS and remote sensing tools, the current dissertation shows the impact of agricultural mutation in drylands and highlights the effect of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) plantations (DPP) on desertification phenomenon in oases of the Algerian Sahara Desert. The spatiotemporal survey was conducted using three Landsat satellite images (TM-1984, ETM+-1999, and OLI-2013). Likelihood supervised classification was used to quantify DPP change over three decades, whereas four remote sensed indices were extracted as indicators of desertification process in the study area: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Salinity Index (SI-T), and Crust Index (CI). Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were applied to test the effects of year and DPP 'presence/absence' for NDVI; year, DPP and NDVI for both CI and NDMI; year, DPP, NDVI and NDMI for SI-T. DPP area and tree numbers quadrupled over the last three decades with a surface increase of 4822 ha and more than 0.5 million trees. DPP presence positively influenced NDVI, NDMI and CI, but negatively affected SI-T. Highly significant positive relationships were found between NDVI-DPP, NDVI-NDMI, and NDVI-CI, although negative relationships were obtained between SI-T-NDVI and SI-T-NDMI. DPP areas indicated higher NDVI, NDMI and CI values, but with lower SI-T values compared to the rest of the desert habitats. Our results highlighted the potential role of DPP in controlling and mitigating desertification in hot drylands. This arises from the effectiveness of strategic agricultural policy programs. Landsat series data provided a cost-efficient tool for monitoring change in oases and arid environments.

TI  - Filling missing data and smoothing altered data in satellite imagery with a spatial functional procedure
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Outliers and missing data are commonly found in satellite imagery. These are usually caused by atmospheric or electronic failures, hampering the correct monitoring of remote-sensing data. To avoid distorted data, we propose a procedure called "spatial functional prediction" (SFP). The SFP procedure consists of the following: (1) aggregating remote-sensing data for reducing the number of missing data and/or outliers; (2) additively decomposing the time series of images into a trend, a seasonal, and an error component; (3) defining the spatial functional data and predicting the trend component using an ordinary kriging; and (4) adding back the seasonal and error components to the predicted trend. The benefits of the SFP procedure are illustrated in the following scenarios: introducing random outliers, random missing data, mixtures of both, and artificial clouds in an extensive simulation study of composite images, and using daily images with real clouds. The following two derived variables are considered: land surface temperature (LST day) and normalized vegetation index (NDVI), which are obtained as remote-sensing data in a region in northern Spain during 2003-2016. The performance of SFP was checked using the root mean squared error (RMSE). A comparison with a procedure based on predicting with thin-plate splines (TpsP) is also made. We conclude that SFP is simpler and faster than TpsP, and provides smaller values of RMSE.

TI  - Prediction of kiwifruit orchard characteristics from satellite images
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dry matter content of New Zealand kiwifruit is currently measured using destructive testing of a 90-fruit sample. Dry matter content varies from 14 to 20% with a standard deviation of 1.05% in the test measurement. This work investigates the use of multispectral data from satellite images of kiwifruit orchards to predict the dry matter of both green and gold kiwifruit. A novel method is developed that reduces the four-dimensional satellite data to three-dimensional unit color vectors and these show a strong linear relationship with measured dry matter. Regression on the data from a set of 20 'training' orchards yielded predictions of dry matter with a standard deviation of 0.76%. When the resulting model was applied to nine test orchards the standard deviation of predicted dry matter was 0.73%. The prediction of dry matter was accurate even when applied to images taken when the fruit was too immature for the standard dry matter measurement test. Therefore, satellite image data may provide a more accurate and non-destructive alternative to the standard 90-fruit test method. It can also provide a way to visualize the variation in dry matter content of the fruit in an orchard; showing regions that would benefit from remedial action and defining areas where fruit harvesting is optimal. Several vegetation indices, derived from satellite image data, are reported in the literature. The strength of the linear correlation between dry matter and twelve common vegetation indices was tested but was found to be much weaker than the correlation developed in this research.

TI  - Measuring Ground Subsidence in Ha Noi Through the Radar Interferometry Technique Using TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) is a widely used technique to measure the ground subsidence and has already shown its ability to map such phenomena on a large spatial scale with millimetric accuracy from space. In Vietnam, to have independent SAR data for surface risk applications, a new X-band SAR mission (JV-LOTUSat) has been scheduled for launch for the 2019-2020 timeframe. However, Vietnam is located in tropical regions where their conditions are impacted by strong atmosphere. The aim of this article is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of the X-band for estimating the ground subsidence under tropical atmospheric conditions. Analysis is carried out on two stacks, TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed X-band, from 2011 to 2014 in Ha Noi. We show that the results on the ground subsidence from InSAR processing can describe consistently the subsidence area based on ground measurements. This article demonstrates that the InSAR technique can be effective at detecting and estimating the subsidence phenomena even with the X-band and under conditions typical of tropical regions. The displacement results from TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed datasets are consistent, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.91 for the period during which their coverage overlaps. Groundwater overexploitation is one of the main causes of the ground subsidence in Ha Noi. This study provides strong support for the scientific potential of the X-band SAR space-borne mission in Vietnam and other tropical countries because it demonstrates the feasibility of the ground subsidence estimates by the X-band SAR, even in conditions impacted by strong atmosphere.

TI  - Evaluation of linear, nonlinear, and hybrid models for predicting PM<sub>2.5</sub> based on a GTWR model and MODIS AOD data
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground monitoring station data of PM2.5 are not available for each day and all places in urban areas. In this research, taking Tehran as an example, a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model was utilized to investigate the spatial and temporal variability relationship between PM2.5 concentrations measured at ground monitoring stations and satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor produced AOD values with 3-km spatial resolution. Using meteorological variables and land use information as additional predictors utilized in the GTWR model, the AOD was converted to PM2.5 at ground level for warm (October to March) and cold seasons (April to September) from 2011 to 2017. To improve the accuracy of the correlation coefficient between converted PM2.5 from the GTWR model and PM2.5 concentrations measured at ground monitoring station, the results of a linear model (LR), a nonlinear model (artificial neural network (ANN)), and hybrid models including general regression neural network (GRNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were compared. The results of the linear, nonlinear, and hybrid models for the cold season display higher accuracy compared with the results for the warm season. Among the used models, the GRNN model has higher accuracy compared with the other models. This study reveals that AOD conversion to particulate matter by the GTWR model and its simulation to PM2.5 at ground level using a hybrid model such as the GRNN can be used to study air quality.

TI  - Drainage of Tumor-Derived DNA into Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released from cancer cells by apoptosis or other mechanisms, and as tumor tissue contains both blood and lymphatic vessels, ctDNA can spread to local lymph nodes (LNs). We aimed to detect the tumor-derived free DNA in metastasis-free LNs in patients with breast cancers harboring the PIK3CA-H1047R mutation. One hundred twenty-three patients were evaluated and the PIK3CA-H1047R mutation was assayed in sentinel LNs (SLNs), non-SLNs without metastasis, and serum by digital PCR. The mutant DNA was more frequent in metastasis-free SLNs (21.6%) than in metastasis-free non-SLNs (8.6%; P = 0.038), and patients with mutation-positive SLNs were more likely to be positive for serum mutant DNA. Apoptosis in primary breast tumors was determined by TUNEL assay. The apoptotic index was significantly higher (P = 0.003) in patients with mutation-positive SLNs without metastasis (mean, 1.17%) than those with mutation-negative SLNs without metastasis (mean, 0.79%). It was also significantly higher (P = 0.006) in those with mutation-positive serum (mean, 1.41%) than in those with mutation-negative serum (mean, 0.86%). Furthermore, fragment size of PIK3CA-H1047R mutant DNA in metastatic-free SLN lysate used for the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay was short (<500 bp). These results support the theory that DNA is released from the primary tumor via apoptotic fragmentation. In conclusion, ctDNA is detectable in metastasis-free LNs and significantly more frequent in SLNs from patients with breast tumors harboring a high apoptotic index, consistent with drainage of ctDNA from apoptotic primary tumor cells into SLNs.

TI  - Characterization of Hymenopteran Parasitoids of <i>Aphis fabae</i> in An African Smallholder Bean Farming System Through Sequencing of COI 'Mini-barcodes'
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasitoids are among the most frequently reported natural enemies of insect pests, particularly aphids. The efficacy of parasitoids as biocontrol agents is influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. For example, hyperparasitoids can reduce the abundance of the primary parasitoids as well as modify their behavior. A field study was conducted at three contrasting elevations on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, to identify the parasitoids of aphids in smallholder bean farming agroecosystems. Sentinel aphids (Aphis fabae) on potted bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) were exposed in 15 bean fields at three elevations for 2 days. The sentinel aphids were then kept in cages in a greenhouse until emergence of the parasitoids, which were collected and preserved in 98% ethanol for identification. Of the 214 parasitoids that emerged from sentinel aphids, the greatest abundance (44.86%) were from those placed at intermediate elevations (1000-1500 m a.s.l), compared to 42.52% from the lowest elevations and only 12.62% from the highest elevation farms. Morphological identification of the parasitoids that emerged from parasitized aphids showed that 90% were Aphidius species (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae). Further characterization by sequencing DNA 'mini-barcodes' identified parasitoids with >= 99% sequence similarity to Aphidius colemani, 94-95% sequence similarity to Pachyneuron aphidis and 90% similarity to a Charipinae sp. in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. These results confidently identified A. colemani as the dominant primary aphid parasitoid of A. fabae in the study area. A Pachyneuron sp., which was most closely related to P. aphidis, and a Charipinae sp. occurred as hyperparasitoids. Thus, interventions to improve landscapes and farming practice should monitor specifically how to augment populations of A. colemani, to ensure any changes enhance the delivery of natural pest regulation. Further studies are needed for continuous monitoring of the hyperparasitism levels and the dynamics of aphids, primary parasitoids, and secondary parasitoids in different cropping seasons and their implications in aphid control.

TI  - Application of satellite image processing and GIS-Spatial modeling for mapping urban areas prone to flash floods in Qena governorate, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods in Egypt are considered frequent meteorological natural hazards. Qena is one of the most Egyptian governorates prone to flash floods. Various flash floods events hit Qena from 1954 till 2016. Flash floods occurred in Qena on 28th October 2016 inundated houses and roads, generated losses in lives, damages to private and public property. The intensive rainfall coupled with the rapid urban expansion in Qena and along the Nile Valley could worsen the situation. Despite, the destructive impacts of the flash floods in Qena, flash floods can be used as a valuable source of fresh water as the study area is classified as an arid zone and characterized with the fresh-water shortage. Integration of remotely sensed data with the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Geographic Information Systems spatial modeling presented valuable analysis techniques in this study. The present study focused on mapping the spatial distribution of flash floods vulnerability in Qena's urban areas. Ten indicators were used to analyze the flood floods namely; rainfall, soil, geology, slope, elevation, flow direction, drainage network, land cover, total population, and population density. The results revealed that Qena, Qus, Naqadah, and Dishna urban districts are the most vulnerable to flash floods and located in the very high zone with 25.3%, 14.9%, 12.3%, and 9.8% respectively. The total population situated at very high and high vulnerability zone reached represents 7.66% and 43.36% of the total population. The obtained results considered crucial information for decision-makers for future effective flash floods hazards mitigation, assessment management, planning, and sustainable development.

AB  - During November-December 2015, very heavy rainfall caused severe flood in Southern Tamil Nadu that resulted in severe damages with huge economic losses as per news agency Times of India. Remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Landsat-8. Operational land imager (OLI) images together with ancillary information such as rainfall and demographic data were used in the current study to assess the extent and impact of flooding. The SAR data are used to map the flood or inundation zones. Landsat-8 OLI is used to extract built-up area affected by the flood employing three methods: built-up area extraction method (BAEM), BAEM with Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), and modified Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) approach. The classification accuracies obtained for these three approaches were 89, 83.5, and 78% for BAEM (using EBBI), BAEM, and NDBI, respectively. Aerial comparison of built-up area extracted using BAEM (using EBBI) shows the best accuracy with respect to the built-up area obtained from very high-resolution imagery. This extracted built-up area BAEM (using EBBI) method was used to estimate the extent of inundation covering the built-up area. Further the flooding risk at village level was assessed using the population density and flooding area. Built-up area extracted was also overlaid with flooding area to highlight actual built-up areas under risk due to flood.

TI  - Improved POLSAR Model-Based Decomposition Interpretation Under Scintillation Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are prone to ionospheric irregularity structures that affect the amplitude and/or phase of the radar signal. Azimuthal striping caused by amplitude scintillation in SAR data is an initial observation of such effects. In the absence of any physical model and/or technique to mitigate scintillation stripes, we have applied a 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach for improved interpretation and target identification in fully polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) model-based decomposition scattering powers. Few scenes of fully polarimetric Advanced Land Observation Satellite-Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 under different ionospheric conditions are acquired and used in this study. As a reference, data sets over the same areas are also acquired on different dates with negligible ionospheric activity (ionospheric quiet day). All the data sets are corrected for the Faraday rotation angle (Omega), which is estimated using the Bickel-Bates approach. Three correction strategies of scintillation-affected model-based scattering power decomposition images are presented. The strategies (zero masking, thresholding, and averaging-post-thresholding) are implemented on 2-D FFT of scattering power images. An intercomparison of corrected decomposition results from the correction strategies demonstrates the capability of 2-D-FFT-based correction strategies to improve the dominant scattering component by 3%-5% for homogeneous terrains. The correction method based on averaging-post-thresholding gives the best results that are further tested by performing a supervised classification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (O A, (k) over cap) of the averaging-post-thresholding technique (72.87%, 0.59) is comparable to those of the reference data (78.74%, 0.69).

TI  - Assessment of the alpine plant species biodiversity in the western Himalaya using Resourcesat-2 imagery and field survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the alpine ecosystem of the Himalaya, an observation of species diversity with habitat heterogeneity predicts some important factors that govern them. Information theory-based species biodiversity at the community level and habitat heterogeneity at the landscape level were studied. Resourcesat-2 linear imaging self-scanning sensor (LISS-III and LISS-IV)-based spectral diversity indices and species diversity indices of four summits with increasing elevation gradients were estimated. The species richness decreased with an increase in elevation. The southern aspect of the sub-alpine zone has the highest biodiversity having a 3.5 Shannon' entropy (H). Despite receiving higher insolation, the increase in elevation leading to coldness and dominance of a few species make the southern aspects less diverse at the higher elevation. Both elevational gradients and microclimatic conditions define biodiversity in the Himalaya. Resolution from coarser (LISS-III) to finer (LISS-IV) to micro (field) scale showed an increasing range of values, H = 0.1, 0.2 and 2.1, respectively. There is significantly less correlation between field and satellite measured biodiversity indices (r, -0.5 to 0.3). To go closer to the field level of biodiversity assessment, there is a need to use satellite data having a higher spatial resolution. Spectral variation hypothesis does not hold good in the alpine ecosystem of the Himalaya.

TI  - Trends in Remote Sensing Accuracy Assessment Approaches in the Context of Natural Resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utility of land cover maps for natural resources management relies on knowing the uncertainty associated with each map. The continuous advances typical of remote sensing, including the increasing availability of higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data and data analysis capabilities, have created both opportunities and challenges for improving the application of accuracy assessment. There are well established accuracy assessment methods, but their underlying assumptions have not changed much in the last couple decades. Consequently, revisiting how map error and accuracy have been performed and reported over the last two decades is timely, to highlight areas where there is scope for better utilization of emerging opportunities. We conducted a quantitative literature review on accuracy assessment practices for mapping via remote sensing classification methods, in both terrestrial and marine environments. We performed a structured search for land and benthic cover mapping, limiting our search to journals within the remote sensing field, and papers published between 1998-2017. After an initial screening process, we assembled a database of 282 papers, and extracted and standardized information on various components of their reported accuracy assessments. We discovered that only 56% of the papers explicitly included an error matrix, and a very limited number (14%) reported overall accuracy with confidence intervals. The use of kappa continues to be standard practice, being reported in 50.4% of the literature published on or after 2012. Reference datasets used for validation were collected using a probability sampling design in 54% of the papers. For approximately 11% of the studies, the sampling design used could not be determined. No association was found between classification complexity (i.e. number of classes) and measured accuracy, independent from the size of the study area. Overall, only 32% of papers included an accuracy assessment that could be considered reproducible; that is, they included a probability-based sampling scheme to collect the reference dataset, a complete error matrix, and provided sufficient characterization of the reference datasets and sampling unit. Our findings indicate that considerable work remains to identify and adopt more statistically rigorous accuracy assessment practices to achieve transparent and comparable land and benthic cover maps.

TI  - Quantifying the Robustness of Vegetation Indices through Global Sensitivity Analysis of Homogeneous and Forest Leaf-Canopy Radiative Transfer Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VIs) are widely used in optical remote sensing to estimate biophysical variables of vegetated surfaces. With the advent of spectroscopy technology, spectral bands can be combined in numerous ways to extract the desired information. This resulted in a plethora of proposed indices, designed for a diversity of applications and research purposes. However, it is not always clear whether they are sensitive to the variable of interest while at the same time, responding insensitive to confounding factors. Hence, to be able to quantify the robustness of VIs, a systematic evaluation is needed, thereby introducing a widest possible variety of biochemical and structural heterogeneity. Such exercise can be achieved with coupled leaf and canopy radiative transfer models (RTMs), whereby input variables can virtually simulate any vegetation scenario. With the intention of evaluating multiple VIs in an efficient way, this led us to the development of a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) toolbox dedicated to the analysis of VIs on their sensitivity towards RTM input variables. We identified VIs that are designed to be sensitive towards leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), leaf water content (LWC) and leaf area index (LAI) for common sensors of terrestrial Earth observation satellites: Landsat 8, MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and the upcoming imaging spectrometer mission EnMAP. The coupled RTMs PROSAIL and PROINFORM were used for simulations of homogeneous and forest canopies respectively. GSA total sensitivity results suggest that LCC-sensitive indices respond most robust: for the great majority of scenarios, chlorophyll a + b content (Cab) drives between 75% and 82% of the indices' variability. LWC-sensitive indices were most affected by confounding variables such as Cab and LAI, although the equivalent water thickness (Cw) can drive between 25% and 50% of the indices' variability. Conversely, the majority of LAI-sensitive indices are not only sensitive to LAI but rather to a mixture of structural and biochemical variables.

TI  - Drawback in the Change Detection Approach: False Detection during the 2018 Western Japan Floods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have been used to map flooded areas with great success. Flooded areas are often identified by detecting changes between a pair of images recorded before and after a certain flood. During the 2018 Western Japan Floods, the change detection method generated significant misclassifications for agricultural targets. To evaluate whether such a situation could be repeated in future events, this paper examines and identifies the causes of the misclassifications. We concluded that the errors occurred because of the following. (i) The use of only a single pair of SAR images from before and after the floods. (ii) The unawareness of the dynamics of the backscattering intensity through time in agricultural areas. (iii) The effect of the wavelength on agricultural targets. Furthermore, it is highly probable that such conditions might occur in future events. Our conclusions are supported by a field survey of 35 paddy fields located within the misclassified area and the analysis of Sentinel-1 time series data. In addition, in this paper, we propose a new parameter, which we named "conditional coherence", that can be of help to overcome the referred issue. The new parameter is based on the physical mechanism of the backscattering on flooded and non-flooded agricultural targets. The performance of the conditional coherence as an input of discriminant functions to identify flooded and non-flooded agricultural targets is reported as well.

TI  - Remote Detection of Varying Water Storage in Relation to Surfacial Temperature of Aral Sea
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake monitoring by remote sensing is of significant importance to understanding the lake and ambient ecological and environmental processes. In particular, whether lake water storage variation could predict lake surfacial temperature or vice versa has long fascinated the research community, in that it would greatly benefit the monitoring missions and scientific interpretation of the lake change processes. This study attempted to remotely detect the dynamics of the Aral Sea and pursue the relationships between varying lake water storage attributes and surface water temperature by using MODIS LST (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Surface Temperature) 8-day composite products, satellite altimeter data, and actual meteorological measurements. Their associations with lake Surface Water Temperatures (SWT) were then analyzed. Results showed the lake water surface areas and elevations of the North Aral Sea tended to increasing trend from 2001 (2793.0 km(2), 13.6 m) to 2015 (6997.8 km(2), 15.9 m), while those of the South Aral Sea showed a decreasing trend during 2001 (20 434.6 km(2), 3.9 m) and 2015 (3256.1 km(2), 0.9 m). In addition, the annual daytime and nighttime lake SWT both decreased in the North Aral Sea, while only the daytime SWT in the South Aral Sea exhibited an increase, indicating a rising deviation of diurnal temperatures in the South Aral Sea during the past 15 yr. Moreover, a lower correlation was found between variations in the daytime SWT and storage capacity in the South Aral Sea (R-2 = 0.33; P < 0.05), no fair correlations were tested between lake water storage and daytime SWT in the North Aral Sea nor between lake water storage and nighttime SWT in either part of the sea. These results implied that climate change, if any at least during the research period, has no significant effects on lake dynamics over the two sectors of the Aral Sea with anthropogenic disturbances. However, climate change and human activities may overlap to explain complex consequences in the lake storage variations. Our results may provide a reference for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of lakes, increasing understanding of the lake water storage changes in relation to the lake SWT, which may benefit the ecological management of the Aral Sea region, in the effort to face the likely threats from climate change and human activities to the region.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring of Thermal Performance in Smart Urban Designs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change amplified by rapidly increasing urbanization is resulting in rising temperatures within urban environments. In recent years, to mitigate this the design and construction of new buildings has emphasized "smart" methods and materials for individual buildings rather than landscape-level planning and evaluation of new developments. Remote Sensing potentially offers a cost-effective means to monitor effectiveness of landscape-level urban design and guide developers to improve thermal regimes. This paper focuses on satellite monitoring of thermal variation in the area of London most affected by construction in 2010-2015. Split-window Land Surface Temperature (LST) models were applied to ASTER and Landsat 8 satellite imagery, requiring separate investigation of thermal trends due to temporal inconsistency. Getis-Ord-Gi* cluster analysis of the ASTER image identified three main thermal hot spots: Eastern, Stratford railway/underground station, and Stratford High Street. It is assumed that increased thermal stress within these areas is mainly from anthropogenic heat. However, local thermal variations for Eastern Olympic Village are attributed to changing meteorological conditions, facade materials, canyon morphology and orientation, or insufficient shading and ventilation. Future development of a new cultural hub at this location will significantly affect distribution of green spaces and influence their cooling ability.

TI  - Adjusting Emergent Herbaceous Wetland Elevation with Object-Based Image Analysis, Random Forest and the 2016 NLCD
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent herbaceous wetlands are characterized by complex salt marsh ecosystems that play a key role in diverse coastal processes including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, flood attenuation and shoreline protection. Surface elevation characterization and spatiotemporal distribution of these ecosystems are commonly obtained from LiDAR measurements as this low-cost airborne technique has a wide range of applicability and usefulness in coastal environments. LiDAR techniques, despite significant advantages, show poor performance in generation of digital elevation models (DEMs) in tidal salt marshes due to large vertical errors. In this study, we present a methodology to (i) update emergent herbaceous wetlands (i.e., the ones delineated in the 2016 National Land Cover Database) to present-day conditions; and (ii) automate salt marsh elevation correction in estuarine systems. We integrate object-based image analysis and random forest technique with surface reflectance Landsat imagery to map three emergent U.S. wetlands in Weeks Bay, Alabama, Savannah Estuary, Georgia and Fire Island, New York. Conducting a hyperparameter tuning of random forest and following a hierarchical approach with three nomenclature levels for land cover classification, we are able to better map wetlands and improve overall accuracies in Weeks Bay (0.91), Savannah Estuary (0.97) and Fire Island (0.95). We then develop a tool in ArcGIS to automate salt marsh elevation correction. We use this 'DEM-correction' tool to modify an existing DEM (model input) with the calculated elevation correction over salt marsh regions. Our method and tool are validated with real-time kinematic elevation data and helps correct overestimated salt marsh elevation up to 0.50 m in the studied estuaries. The proposed tool can be easily adapted to different vegetation species in wetlands, and thus help provide accurate DEMs for flood inundation mapping in estuarine systems.

TI  - Ground Deformations Controlled by Hidden Faults: Multi-Frequency and Multitemporal InSAR Techniques for Urban Hazard Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the study of land subsidence processes by means of multi-temporal and multi-frequency InSAR techniques. Specifically, we retrieve the long-term evolution (2003-2018) of the creeping phenomenon producing ground fissuring in the Ciudad Guzman (Jalisco state, Mexico) urban area. The city is located on the northern side of the Volcan de Colima area, one of the most active Mexican volcanoes. On September 21 2012, Ciudad Guzman was struck by ground fissures of about 1.5 km of length, causing the deformation of the roads and the propagation of fissures in adjacent buildings. The field surveys showed that fissures follow the escarpments produced during the central Mexico September 19 1985 Mw 8.1 earthquake. We extended the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometric monitoring starting with the multi-temporal analysis of ENVISAT and COSMO-SkyMed datasets, allowing the monitoring of the observed subsidence phenomena affecting the Mexican city. We processed a new stack of Sentinel-1 TOPSAR acquisition mode images along both descending and ascending paths and spanning the 2016-2018 temporal period. The resulting long-term trend observed by satellites, together with data from volcanic bulletin and in situ surveys, seems to suggest that the subsidence is due to the exploitation of the aquifers and that the spatial arrangement of ground deformation is controlled by the position of buried faults.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential zones using geospatial techniques and analytical hierarchy process in Dumka district, Jharkhand, India
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to delineate groundwater potential zones using an integrated approach of remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method in Dumka district, Jharkhand, India. Multiple data as lithology, lineament density, geomorphology, slope, soil, rainfall, drainage density and land use/land cover were considered for delineating the groundwater potential zones. Spatially distributed maps/thematic layers of all the aforementioned parameters were created using remotely sensed as well as ground data in a GIS environment. These thematic layers were assigned suitable weights on the Saaty's scale according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence in the study area. The assigned weights of the thematic layers and their features were then normalized by using the AHP technique. Ultimately, all thematic layers were integrated by a weighted linear combination method in a GIS environment to produce a groundwater potential zones map. The delineated groundwater potential zones in the study area, were categorized as 'very good', 'good', 'moderate', and 'poor' respectively. The results showed that area along the Mayurakshi River (Rajmahal, Pipra, Lathipahar, Phitkoria, Jhajhapur, etc.) which is approximately 11% (404.96 km(2)) of the total study area was delineated as an area having 'very good' potential for groundwater. The 'good zone' delineated encompassed approximately 38% (1,389.61 km(2)) of the study area and was found in the pediment-pediplain complex zone. The `moderate zones encompassed approximately 44% (1,602.07 km(2)) of the area. The 'poor zones' encompassed approximately 7% (260.58 km(2)) of the area which included Raneshwar, Asanbani, Chichro, Sarni and certain parts of Musna. The groundwater potential zone map was compared with the actual discharge data from various wells within the study area and was found reasonable. Overall, this study provides a convenient approach of delineating the potential of groundwater availability which ultimately will aid in better planning and managing of groundwater resources.

TI  - Mapping Wetland Dynamics With SAR-Based Change Detection in the Cloud
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The wetlands are often coupled with anthropogenic systems. This makes them highly dynamic, and thus difficult to map and monitor from space. The Sentinel-1 constellation allows monitoring land changes regardless of cloud conditions and with a high frequency of pass. We use a time series of 33 Sentinel-1 dual-polarized images from 2016 to map seasonal changes at the artificial Lake of Kerkini, in Greece. The images are accessed and processed in Google Earth Engine via a Flask web application. Points of change within the time series and frequency of change were determined according to an omnibus-test statistic. The results were compared to an optical-based land cover map and gaging measurements. Frequency of change patterns matched different land cover types, indicating that frequency of change is related to the physical and structural properties of the land cover. This methodology can be used operationally to improve our understanding of ecosystems, enhance land cover maps, and to monitor wetland dynamics as well as cover changes caused by human activities.

TI  - Tropospheric corrections for InSAR: Statistical assessments and applications to the Central United States and Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of SAR data availability and advancements in InSAR processing methods has enabled the formation of ground displacement time series for many parts of the world where such research was previously hindered by decorrelation due to sparse temporal sampling and SAR operating frequency. In particular, free and open data access from the European Sentinel-1 constellation and the future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission is encouraging the global community to move towards automated, cloud-based processing that can accommodate these rapidly growing data volumes and facilitate the use of a suite of corrections to the data. A key challenge is related to path delays introduced when the radar signal propagates through the troposphere. Tropospheric corrections estimated from empirical, phase-based methods and those using independent data from weather models, GPS, and radiometers have been included in open-source packages such as TRAIN, PyAPS and GACOS. Users within the InSAR community have reported varying degrees of success using these methods in a range of areas around the world. However, the various statistical metrics used to evaluate the reliability of tropospheric corrections are not consistently applied and often depend on the area and the spatial scale over which they are evaluated. Examination of a simple metric such as the overall reduction in phase variability within an interferogram does not allow the user to determine whether the improvement was at large or short length scales. We present a review of existing tropospheric correction methods and statistical performance metrics, providing guidelines for global assessment and verification of the efficacy of tropospheric correction methods. We summarize the assumptions and limitations for each correction method as well as each statistical performance metric. We examine two regions with different atmospheric characteristics - one Sentinel-1 swath covering the central United States and one swath covering south central Mexico, including part of the Pacific coast. As the SAR community moves towards reliance on global and automated InSAR processing platforms that incorporate tropospheric corrections, approaches such as those examined here can aid researchers in their efforts to evaluate such corrections and include their uncertainties in derived products such as surface displacement time series, coseismic offsets, processes that correlate with topography, and signals with smaller magnitude or larger spatial scales such as those associated with small earthquakes, aseismic creep and slow slip events. We found that the GACOS products (leveraging the operational high resolution ECMWF weather model) outperform the other correction methods explored here on average, but this result is highly dependent on location, acquisition time, and data availability. We found spatial structure functions to be most useful for performance assessment because of their ability to convey information about performance at discrete spatial scales.

TI  - Coral Reef Mapping of UAV: A Comparison of Sun Glint Correction Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although methods were proposed for eliminating sun glint effects from airborne and satellite images over coral reef environments, a method was not proposed previously for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image data. De-glinting in UAV image analysis may improve coral distribution mapping accuracy result compared with an uncorrected image classification technique. The objective of this research was to determine accuracy of coral reef habitat classification maps based on glint correction methods proposed by Lyzenga et al., Joyce, Hedley et al., and Goodman et al. The UAV imagery collected from the coral-dominated Pulau Bidong (Peninsular Malaysia) on 20 April 2016 was analyzed in this study. Images were pre-processed with the following two strategies: Strategy-1 was the glint removal technique applied to the whole image, while Strategy-2 used only the regions impacted by glint instead of the whole image. Accuracy measures for the glint corrected images showed that the method proposed by Lyzenga et al. following Strategy-2 could eliminate glints over the branching coral-Acropora (BC), tabulate coral-Acropora + Montipora (TC), patch coral (PC), coral rubble (R), and sand (S) with greater accuracy than the other four methods using Strategy-1. Tested in two different coral environments (Site-1: Pantai Pasir Cina and Site-2: Pantai Vietnam), the glint-removed UAV imagery produced reliable maps of coral habitat distribution with finer details. The proposed strategies can potentially be used to remove glint from UAV imagery and may improve usability of glint-affected imagery, for analyzing spatiotemporal changes of coral habitats from multi-temporal UAV imagery.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Data for Winter Wheat Phenology Monitoring and Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data to detect the main wheat phenological phases was investigated in the Bekaa plain of Lebanon. Accordingly, the temporal variation of Sentinel-1 (S1) signal was analyzed as a function of the phenological phases' dates observed in situ (germination; heading and soft dough), and harvesting. Results showed that S1 data, unlike the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, were able to estimate the dates of theses phenological phases due to significant variations in S1 temporal series at the dates of germination, heading, soft dough, and harvesting. Particularly, the ratio VV/VH at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees) was able to detect the germination and harvesting dates. VV polarization at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees) was able to detect the heading phase, while VH polarization at high incidence angle (43-45 degrees) was better than that at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees), in detecting the soft dough phase. An automated approach for main wheat phenological phases' determination was then developed on the western part of the Bekaa plain. This approach modelled the S1 SAR temporal series by smoothing and fitting the temporal series with Gaussian functions (up to three Gaussians) allowing thus to automatically detect the main wheat phenological phases from the sum of these Gaussians. To test its robustness, the automated method was applied on the northern part of the Bekaa plain, in which winter wheat is harvested usually earlier because of the different weather conditions. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimation of the phenological phases' dates was 2.9 days for germination, 5.5 days for heading, 5.1 days soft dough, 3.0 days for West Bekaa's harvesting, and 4.5 days for North Bekaa's harvesting. In addition, a slight underestimation was observed for germination and heading of West Bekaa (-0.2 and -1.1 days, respectively) while an overestimation was observed for soft dough of West Bekaa and harvesting for both West and North Bekaa (3.1, 0.6, and 3.6 days, respectively). These results are encouraging, and thus prove that S1 data are powerful as a tool for crop monitoring, to serve enhanced crop management and production handling.

TI  - Extratropical Cyclone Clouds in the GFDL Climate Model: Diagnosing Biases and the Associated Causes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The clouds in Southern Hemisphere extratropical cyclones generated by the GFDL climate model are analyzed against MODIS, CloudSat, and CALIPSO cloud and precipitation observations. Two model versions are used: one is a developmental version of "AM4," a model GFDL that will utilize for CMIP6, and the other is the same model with a different parameterization of moist convection. Both model versions predict a realistic top-of-atmosphere cloud cover in the southern oceans, within 5% of the observations. However, an examination of cloud cover transects in extratropical cyclones reveals a tendency in the models to overestimate high-level clouds (by differing amounts) and underestimate cloud cover at low levels (again by differing amounts), especially in the post-cold frontal (PCF) region, when compared with observations. In focusing only on the models, it is seen that their differences in high and midlevel clouds are consistent with their differences in convective activity and relative humidity (RH), but the same is not true for the PCF region. In this region, RH is higher in the model with less cloud fraction. These seemingly contradictory cloud and RH differences can be explained by differences in the cloud-parameterization tuning parameters that ensure radiative balance. In the PCF region, the model cloud differences are smaller than either of the model biases with respect to observations, suggesting that other physics changes are needed to address the bias. The process-oriented analysis used to assess these model differences will soon be automated and shared.

TI  - Long term outcomes in patients with sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified by injecting remaining scar after previously excised vulvar cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Previous excision of the vulvar tumor may disrupt lymphatic channels and alter the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. The purpose of this study was to measure outcomes after SLN biopsy in patients with and without previous excision of the vulvar tumor.Methods. Retrospective study of patients at a single institution with primary vulvar cancer, clinically negative nodes, and vulvar tumors < 4 cm treated with surgical excision who had SLN biopsy (2008-2015).Results. There were 106 cases of concomitant wide local excision (WLE) and SLN biopsy and 24 additional cases of patients who had previous vulvar surgery and no visible tumor; these patients underwent scar re-excision and SLN biopsy. Median follow-up was 31 months. Patients who had previous tumor excision were more likely to be of younger age (p = 0.0001), have a smaller tumor (p = 0.002), and less depth of invasion (p = 0.02). In the wide local excision of the scar specimen, 11 patients (46%) had no residual disease left, 8 patients (33%) had only vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VINIII), 4 patients (17%) had carcinoma in situ with focal invasion and 1 patient (4%) had invasive carcinoma within the second specimen, resected with clear margins. There were no groin recurrences in patients who underwent scar re-excision and who had a negative SLN biopsy.Conclusion. SLN biopsy is feasible and safe in patients who have had previous excision of the vulvar tumor and present with a scar. When a SLN is detected by injecting the remaining scar, this accurately reflects the nodal status and does not negatively impact oncologic outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acquiring the Arctic-Scale Spatial Distribution of Snow Depth Based on AMSR-E Snow Depth Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow on sea ice is a key variable in Arctic climate studies and thus plays an important role in geophysics. However, snow depths (SDs) derived from passive satellite remote sensing data are missing on multiyear ice due to the limitation of algorithm. We interpolate the SDs using the polynomial fitting (PF) method, trigonometric polynomial fitting (TPF) method, and multiquadric function interpolation method, and NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) SD product is used to assess errors. Results show that TPF with the highest degree in x direction equaling 2 and the highest degree in y direction equaling 4 (TPF24) is the most satisfactory method, which has a deviation of 7.19 cm from OIB SD. Although PF with the highest degree in x and y directions being 7 and 8, respectively (PF78), also performs well in terms of error (7.22 cm), unreasonable value will be obtained at the edge due to its high degree. Results of TPF24 show a thicker SD area located in the north of Greenland, which is in good agreement with the actual situation.

TI  - Assessing Spatiotemporal Variations of Landsat Land Surface Temperature and Multispectral Indices in the Arctic Mackenzie Delta Region between 1985 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperatures in the Arctic have increased substantially over the last decades, which has extensively altered the properties of the land surface. Capturing the state and dynamics of Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) at high spatial detail is of high interest as LST is dependent on a variety of surficial properties and characterizes the land-atmosphere exchange of energy. Accordingly, this study analyses the influence of different physical surface properties on the long-term mean of the summer LST in the Arctic Mackenzie Delta Region (MDR) using Landsat 30 m-resolution imagery between 1985 and 2018 by taking advantage of the cloud computing capabilities of the Google Earth Engine. Multispectral indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Tasseled Cap greenness (TCG), brightness (TCB), and wetness (TCW) as well as topographic features derived from the TanDEM-X digital elevation model are used in correlation and multiple linear regression analyses to reveal their influence on the LST. Furthermore, surface alteration trends of the LST, NDVI, and NDWI are revealed using the Theil-Sen (T-S) regression method. The results indicate that the mean summer LST appears to be mostly influenced by the topographic exposition as well as the prevalent moisture regime where higher evapotranspiration rates increase the latent heat flux and cause a cooling of the surface, as the variance is best explained by the TCW and northness of the terrain. However, fairly diverse model outcomes for different regions of the MDR (R-2 from 0.31 to 0.74 and RMSE from 0.51 degrees C to 1.73 degrees C) highlight the heterogeneity of the landscape in terms of influential factors and suggests accounting for a broad spectrum of different factors when modeling mean LSTs. The T-S analysis revealed large-scale wetting and greening trends with a mean decadal increase of the NDVI/NDWI of approximately +0.03 between 1985 and 2018, which was mostly accompanied by a cooling of the land surface given the inverse relationship between mean LSTs and vegetation and moisture conditions. Disturbance through wildfires intensifies the surface alterations locally and lead to significantly cooler LSTs in the long-term compared to the undisturbed surroundings.

TI  - Ionospheric correction of ALOS-2 full-aperture ScanSAR interferometric data for surface deformation measurement in Beijing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionospheric disturbance is one of the most serious factors that limit the accuracy of deformation measurement of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) especially for spaceborne SAR systems in low frequency such as L-band. Especially in imaging modes with a large coverage, ScanSAR mode for example, ionospheric disturbance phase screen almost submerges other useful geographical information. In this study, two ALOS-2 (L-band) full-aperture ScanSAR images (October 2015 and October 2016) are used to study ground deformation in Beijing from 2015 to 2016. The split range-spectrum technique is adopted to extract ionospheric distortion. The authors splice the differential interferograms of adjacent subswaths by resampling them to perform the overall ionospheric extraction. Also non-local filtering is used to improve the coherence of interferograms. Spatial deformation distribution that was obtained by differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technique using the two ALOS-2 ScanSAR images is highly consistent with the result obtained by persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) technique using Sentinel Tops mode images (October 2015-February 2017). The comparison results show the effectiveness of the ionospheric distortion extraction method used in this study. Moreover, the spatial distribution is also highly consistent with the results before 2014, which means that the deformation trend in Beijing continues.

TI  - Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Data for the Generation of Continuously Updated Forest Type Information Layers in a Cross-Border Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - From global monitoring to regional forest management there is an increasing demand for information about forest ecosystems. For border regions that are closely connected ecologically and economically, a key factor is the cross-border availability and consistency of up-to-date information such as the forest type. The combination of existing forest information with Earth observation data is a rational method and can provide valuable contribution to serve the increased information demand on a transnational level. We present an approach for the remote sensing-based generation of a transnational and temporally consistent forest type information layer for the German federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Existing forest information data from different countries were merged and combined with suitable vegetation indices derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery acquired in early spring. An automated bootstrap-based approximation of the optimum threshold for the distinction of "broadleaved" and "coniferous" forest was applied. The spatially explicit forest type information layer is updated annually depending on image availability. Overall accuracies between 79 and 96 percent were obtained. Every spot in the region will be updated successively within a period of expectably three years. The presented approach can be integrated in fully automated processing chains to generate basic forest type information layers on a regular basis.

TI  - Nuclear medicine practice in Japan: a report of the eighth nationwide survey in 2017
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Subcommittee on Survey of Nuclear Medicine Practice in Japan has performed a nationwide survey of nuclear medicine practice every 5 years since 1982 to survey contemporary nuclear medicine practice and its changes over the years.Methods The subcommittee sent questionnaires, including the number and category of examinations as well as the kind and dose of the radiopharmaceuticals during the 30 days of June 2017, to all nuclear medicine institutes. The total numbers for the year 2017 were then estimated.Results A total of 1132 institutes responded to the survey, including 351 PET centers. The recovery rate was 90.6%. The number of gamma cameras installed was 1332 in total, with 7.0% decrease in 5 years. Dual-head cameras and hybrid SPECT/CT scanners accounted for 88.2 and 23.6%, respectively. The number of single-photon tracer studies in 2017 was 1.08 million which means a decrease in 5.7% in 5 years and 23.6% in 10 years. All but neurotransmitter system, sentinel lymph node, and liver scintigraphy decreased. Bone scintigraphy was a leading examination (32.3%), followed by myocardial scintigraphy (24.1%) and cerebral perfusion study (18.0%) in order. SPECT studies showed an increase from 47.2% to 63.5%. PET centers have also increased from 295 to 389, as compared to the last survey. The 112 PET centers have installed one or two in-house cyclotrons. PET studies showed 24.5% increase in 5 years, with oncology accounting for 88.9%. F-18-FDG accounted for 98.2% (630,570 examinations). PET examinations using C-11-methionine have decreased, with 2440 examinations in 2017. PET examinations using N-13-NH3 have been increasing, with 2363 examinations in 2017. The number of PET studies using C-11-PIB was 904. I-131-radioiodine targeted therapies showed an increase in 5 years (23.1%), including 4487 patients for thyroid cancer. Out-patient thyroid bed ablation therapy with 1,110 MBq of I-131 accounted for 36.6% of cancer patients. The number of admission rooms increased from 135 to 157 in 5 years. The number of Ra-223 targeted therapies for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer was 1194 patients.Conclusions Single-photon examinations showed a continuous tendency toward a decline in the survey. In contrast, the number of hybrid SPECT/CT scanner examinations has increased. PET/CT study and radionuclide targeted therapy have steadily increased.

TI  - Robust boundary extraction of great lakes by blocking Active Contour Model using Chinese GF-3 SAR data: a case study of Danjiangkou reservoir, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite is a spaceborne multi-polarisation synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission in Cband and it can be applied in the multiple fields. GF-3 can achieve accurate water boundary extraction based on its high-resolution SAR image products. This paper will study GF-3's capability to extract water boundary. Danjiangkou reservoir, the largest artificial freshwater lake in Asia and water source of Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project, is selected as the study region. A novel segmentation method is proposed which consists of two parts: the first part is rough segmentation to get the initial boundary; the second part is fine segmentation to get the final water boundary. Experimental results show that GF-3 has good performance in water boundary exaction by virtue of this novel method.

TI  - Dynamic Multicontext Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images Based on Convolutional Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation requires methods capable of learning high-level features while dealing with large volume of data. Toward such goal, convolutional networks can learn specific and adaptable features based on the data. However, these networks are not capable of processing a whole remote sensing image, given its huge size. To overcome such limitation, the image is processed using fixed size patches. The definition of the input patch size is usually performed empirically (evaluating several sizes) or imposed (by network constraint). Both strategies suffer from drawbacks and could not lead to the best patch size. To alleviate this problem, several works exploited multicontext information by combining networks or layers. This process increases the number of parameters, resulting in a more difficult model to train. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to perform semantic segmentation of remote sensing images that exploits a multicontext paradigm without increasing the number of parameters while defining, in training time, the best patch size. The main idea is to train a dilated network with distinct patch sizes, allowing it to capture multicontext characteristics from heterogeneous contexts. While processing these varying patches, the network provides a score for each patch size, helping in the definition of the best size for the current scenario. A systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted using four high-resolution remote sensing data sets with very distinct properties. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides improvements in pixelwise classification accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Quantitizing Affective Data as Project Evaluation on the Use of a Mathematics Mobile Game and Intelligent Tutoring System
T2  - INFORMATICS IN EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Technology-echnology-enhanced learning generally focuses on the cognitive rather than the affective domain of learning. This multi-method evaluation of the INBECOM project (Integrating Behaviourism and Constructivism in Mathematics) was conducted from the point of view of affective learning levels of Krathwohl et al. (1964). The research questions of the study were: (i) to explore the affective learning experiences of the three groups of participants (researchers, teachers and students) during the use of a mobile game UFractions and an intelligent tutoring system Active Math to enhance the learning of fractions in mathematics; and (ii) to determine the significance of the relationships among the affective learning experiences of the three groups of participants (researchers, teachers and students) in the INBECOM project.This research followed a sequential, equal status, multi-mode research design and methodology where the qualitative data were derived from the interviews with researchers, teachers and students, as well as from learning diaries, feelings blogs, and observations (311 documents) across three contexts (South Africa, Finland, and Mozambique). The qualitative data was quantitized (Saldana, 2009), i.e. analysed deductively in an objective and quantifiable way as instances on an Excel (TM) spreadsheet for statistical analyses. All the data was explored from the affective perspective by labelling the feelings participants experienced according to the affective levels of the Krathwohl et al. (1964) framework.The researchers concluded that: (i) the research participants not only received information, but actively participated in the learning process; responded to what they learned; associated value to their acquired knowledge; organised their values; elaborated on their learning; built abstract knowledge; and adopted a belief system and a personal worldview; and (ii) affirmation of affective learning at all five levels was recognised among the three groups of participants. The study raised a number of issues which could be addressed in future, like how affective levels of learning are intertwined with cognitive levels of learning while learning mathematics in a technology-enhanced learning environment; and how pedagogical models which take into account both cognitive and affective aspects of learning support deep learning.

TI  - An assessment of natural and manmade hazard effects on the underwater light field of the Doce River continental shelf
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and manmade disasters have occurred more frequently due mainly to climate change and human pressure for productivity. One of the world's vastest disasters in the mining industry occurred due to the collapse of the Fundao dam, Brazil, which discharged about 43 million m(3) of iron tailings at the Doce River basin. Extreme natural events also affect this region and provoke substantial mass movement and substantial floods in the Doce River basin, and flow of anomalous volumes of sediments in its mouth. The extent of tailings and the sediment flow in these events were approached in previous research. However, their effects on the penetration of sunlight into the water column in the coastal region are unknown. Here, we evaluate the effects of an extreme natural event and a manmade disaster on the light regime of the water column at the Doce River mouth, using remote sensing data. In both events, the spatial and temporal distribution of suspended particulate matter (SPM), diffuse light attenuation coefficient (K(cl)490) and Euphotic Zone (Z(eu)) were analyzed. During the natural event light penetration into the water column was strongly attenuated (K d 490: 0.35 m(-1); SPM: 8.81 g/m(3)) but re-established after 1 month due to sediment deposition. In the case of the dam collapse, the attenuation of light penetration was also intense along the event (K(d)490: 0.34 m(-1); SPM: 13.87 g/m(3)); however, sediment deposition occurred sooner. Re-suspension of sediments due to wind action was recurrent after 8 months of the dam collapse, in contrast to the natural event where re-suspension was not perceptible in satellite images. The results indicate that both events have considerable effects on the penetration of light in the water column, but with different intensity and length. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) by unplanned and uncontrolled urban expansion have a significant effect on ecosystem service values (ESVs). Objectives of the study were (1) to extract LULC status and its change between 2006 and 2016; (2) to predict two different LULC scenarios in 2026 and; (3) to assess LULCC impact on ESVs. Herein, Landsat imageries in 2006, 2011 and 2016 were used to classify LULC types by object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the derived results were applied to predict LULC in 2026 of two scenarios by CLUE-S model and to assess the impact of LULCC on ESVs. Results revealed that paddy field and field crop notably decreased while urban and built-up areas and rangeland dramatically increased over the study periods whereas total ESVs declined from about 145 MM USD in 2006 to 132 MM USD in 2026 of Scenario II and the ESVs of three dominant ecosystem service functions (waste treatment, water supply, and climate regulation) continuously decreased. The impact of LULCC on ESVs remarkably differed among the LULC types. In conclusion, land use and city planners should try to minimize the effect of LULCC on ESVs during the planning process.

AB  - On 18 April 2012, a cyclone originating in the Central Mediterranean caused a southerly non-convective high wind event, gusts >= 50 kn and not associated with thunderstorms, in the western and interior regions of Turkey. Dust events occurred because of dust plumes that rose from the Sahara Desert and from the interior regions of Turkey. The particle matter profile (PM10) on 18 April 2012 was the result of dust transport that appeared in conjunction with a non-convective high wind event, which is investigated in this study. The main objective of this research is to describe the conditions that prevailed before or during the event that occurred over airports and the long-range (intercontinental) trans-boundary transport of PM10 in Turkey. The dust transport trajectories were adjusted to determine the trajectories of longrange dust particles and/or dust particles that moved from interior regions of Turkey using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and by calculating the backward trajectories of airports that experienced dust occurrences. Furthermore, dust RGB and MODIS satellite pictures, CALIPSO images, BSC-DREAM8b outputs, Global Forecast System analysis outputs, and surface chart analysis outputs were used for various analyses. On 18 April 2012, Turkey's largest average hourly value of PM10 was observed to be 844 lg/m(3) at Kayseri 1 Air Quality Observation Station. Consequently, it was concluded that the Sahara Desert is the main source of dust transport in Turkey.

TI  - 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography in locoregional staging and assessment of biological and clinical aggressiveness of breast cancer subtypes
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We aimed to evaluate the availability of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) in initial axillary lymph node (ALN) staging in breast cancer. The secondary objective is to evaluate the role of FDG PET/CT as a pretest in sentinel lymph node biopsy vs. axillary lymph node dissection when predicting disease aggressiveness. Methods The study evaluated retrospectively 194 breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative 18F-FDG. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of FDG PET/CT for ALN metastases were confirmed with histopathology as the gold standard. Results The value of the area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for ALN metastases were determined as 0.847, 78.8% and 92.6%, respectively. The cut-off value of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for metastatic ALN detection was calculated as 1.79. PPV, NPV and the accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 0.933 (93.3%), 0.75 (75%) and 0.837 (83.7%), respectively. The SUVmax value of the primary lesion was significantly correlated with grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, SUVmax value of metastatic ALN, Her-2 status and Ki-67 level. Molecular subtypes revealed no statistically significant difference in terms of mean SUVmax value. Conclusion High values of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV encourage utilization of PET/CT for locoregional staging of nonmetastatic breast carcinoma. The significant correlation between the primary tumor SUVmax value and grade, ER status, PR status and Ki-67 level increases the prognostic predictive value of the preoperative PET/CT.

TI  - The spatiotemporal shoreline dynamics of a delta under natural and anthropogenic conditions from 1950 to 2018: A dramatic case from the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of dams on rivers feeding deltas has caused rapid shoreline retreat of many deltas around the world. To show that the retreat has been due to anthropogenic effects, it is very important to observe the natural shoreline changes before the dams effects on a delta. This study investigated shoreline changes in the Seyhan Delta in the Eastern Mediterranean from 1950 to 2018 employing long-term Landsat satellite images and aerial photographs. The results indicated that the shoreline accreted nearly +131 m with a maximum rate of + 22.9 m yr(-1) from 1950 to 1956. In this period an area of +322 071 m(2) was added to the delta. Contrary to this, following the construction of the Seyhan Dam in 1956, the Seyhan Delta lost a total area of -4 039 251 m(2) from 1956 to 2018. The shoreline retreated -2293 m at the river mouth, with a maximum rate of retreat of -37 m yr(-1). The major cause of this retreat is the trapping behind the Seyhan Dam of sediments transported by the Seyhan River. In the future, it is expected that the shoreline will retreat even more rapidly from causes such as the construction of further planned dams, deltaic subsidence and rising of global sea level. This situation will have a great impact upon wetland areas and upon agricultural and tourism areas and structures in the delta.

TI  - Kernel Anomalous Change Detection for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomalous change detection (ACD) is an important problem in remote sensing image processing. Detecting not only pervasive but also anomalous or extreme changes has many applications for which methodologies are available. This paper introduces a nonlinear extension of a full family of anomalous change detectors. In particular, we focus on algorithms that utilize Gaussian and elliptically contoured (EC) distribution and extend them to their nonlinear counterparts based on the theory of reproducing kernels' Hilbert space. We illustrate the performance of the kernel methods introduced in both pervasive and ACD problems with real and simulated changes in multispectral and hyperspectral imagery with different resolutions (AVIRIS, Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, and Quickbird). A wide range of situations is studied in real examples, including droughts, wildfires, and urbanization. Excellent performance in terms of detection accuracy compared to linear formulations is achieved, resulting in improved detection accuracy and reduced false-alarm rates. Results also reveal that the EC assumption may be still valid in Hilbert spaces. We provide an implementation of the algorithms as well as a database of natural anomalous changes in real scenarios http://isp.uv.es/kacd.html.

TI  - Worldviews and the construal of suffering from depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine how worldview differences affect the construal of depression. Two suffering construals are identified: redemptive construals, which emphasize the growth-oriented teleological purpose of depression, and biomedical construals, which emphasize a restorative teleology whereby depression should be pharmacologically treated to return individuals to normal functioning. Due to their assumptions about human nature, we anticipated that humanistic and normativistic worldviews would be associated with redemptive and biomedical construals, respectively. Four studies examined whether these associations are (a) cross-sectionally evident, (b) causal in nature, and (c) impacted by perceived risk for depression. Humanism was positively and causally associated with redemptive construals; this association was strengthened by perceived personal risk for depression. Normativism was consistently positively associated with biomedical construals, except when participants anticipated an assessment of their risk for depression. Furthermore, in one study (Study 1B), normativism was associated with fear-based stigma of a depressed individual (being more likely to view this person as dangerous because of their condition). These results provide initial evidence for our novel theoretical framework, which, in distinction to prior theory and research, highlights the importance of (a) assessing worldview beyond political orientation in explaining depression attitudes and (b) lay teleologies, as distinct from "folk etiologies," of mental illness. Redemptive and biomedical construals have different implications for phenomena such as treatment adherence and stigma.

TI  - Assessing the pasturelands and livestock dynamics in Brazil, from 1985 to 2017: A novel approach based on high spatial resolution imagery and Google Earth Engine cloud computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The livestock activity accounts for a large part of the transformations in land cover in the world, with pasture areas being the main land use in Brazil and the main livelihood of the largest commercial herd in the world. In this sense, a better understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of pasture areas is of fundamental importance for a better occupation and territorial governance. Moreover, because they provide different ecosystem services, pastures play a key role in mitigating climate change and in meeting GHG emission reduction targets. Within this context, and based on Landsat image processing via machine learning methods in a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine), this work has mapped, annually and in an unprecedented way, the totality of the Brazilian pastures, from 1985 to 2017. With an overall accuracy of about 90%, the 33 maps produced indicated the pasture area varying from similar to 118 Mha +/- 3.41% (1985) to similar to 178 Mha +/- 2.53% (2017), with this expansion occurring mostly in the northern region of the country and to a lesser extent in the midwest. Temporarily, most of this expansion occurred in the first half of the period evaluated (i.e. between 1985 and 2002), with an increase in Brazilian pasture areas of similar to 57 mha in just 17 years. After 2002, this area remained relatively stable, varying between similar to 175 mha +/- 2.48% and similar to 178 mha +/- 2.53% by 2017. In 33 years, about 87% of the mapped areas experienced zero, one, two, or three land-cover / land-use transitions; overall, of the similar to 178 mha 2.53% of existing pastures in 2017, similar to 52 mha are at least 33 years old, similar to 66 mha were formed after 1985, and similar to 33 mha may have undergone some reform action in the period under consideration. The dynamics revealed in this study reinforce the thesis of pasture utilization as a land reserve, and demonstrate the importance of these areas in the economic, social, and environmental aspects of Brazil.

TI  - Retrieval of Evapotranspiration from Sentinel-2: Comparison of Vegetation Indices, Semi-Empirical Models and SNAP Biophysical Processor Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing evapotranspiration estimation over agricultural areas is increasingly used for irrigation management during the crop growing cycle. Different methodologies based on remote sensing have emerged for the leaf area index (LAI) and the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) estimation, essential biophysical parameters for crop evapotranspiration monitoring. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) spectral information, this study performed a comparative analysis of empirical (vegetation indices), semi-empirical (CLAIR model with fixed and calibrated extinction coefficient) and artificial neural network S2 products derived from the Sentinel Application Platform Software (SNAP) biophysical processor (ANN S2 products) approaches for the estimation of LAI and CCC. Four independent in situ collected datasets of LAI and CCC, obtained with standard instruments (LAI-2000, SPAD) and a smartphone application (PocketLAI), were used. The ANN S2 products present good statistics for LAI (R-2 > 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.86) and CCC (R-2 > 0.75, RMSE < 0.68 g/m(2)) retrievals. The normalized Sentinel-2 LAI index (SeLI) is the index that presents good statistics in each dataset (R-2 > 0.71, RMSE < 0.78) and for the CCC, the ratio red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge) (R-2 > 0.67, RMSE < 0.62 g/m(2)). Both indices use bands located in the red-edge zone, highlighting the importance of this region. The LAI CLAIR model with a fixed extinction coefficient value produces a R-2 > 0.63 and a RMSE < 1.47 and calibrating this coefficient for each study area only improves the statistics in two areas (RMSE approximate to 0.70). Finally, this study analyzed the influence of the LAI parameter estimated with the different methodologies in the calculation of crop potential evapotranspiration (ETc) with the adapted Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM), using a multi-temporal dataset. The results were compared with ETc estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and on the crop coefficient (K-c) derived from FAO table values. In the absence of independent reference ET data, the estimated ETc with the LAI in situ values were considered as the proxy of the ground-truth. ETc estimated with the ANN S2 LAI product is the closest to the ETc values calculated with the LAI in situ (R-2 > 0.90, RMSE < 0.41 mm/d). Our findings indicate the good validation of ANN S2 LAI and CCC products and their further suitability for the implementation in evapotranspiration retrieval of agricultural areas.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature in Global Analyses: Gains from the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) derived from passive microwave (PMW) observations benefit global ocean and SST analyses because of their near-all-weather availability. Present PMW SSTs have a real aperture-limited spatial resolution in excess of 50 km, limiting the spatial fidelity with which SST features, reflecting ocean dynamics, can be captured. This contrasts with the target resolution of global analyses of 5 to 10 km. The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is a mission concept under consideration as a high-priority candidate mission for the expansion of the Copernicus space programme. This instrument would be capable of real aperture resolution < 15 km with low total uncertainties in the range 0.4-0.8 K for channels between 1.4 and 36.5 GHz, and a dual-view arrangement that further reduces noise. This paper provides a comparative study of SST uncertainty and feature resolution with and without the availability of CIMR in the future SST-observing satellite constellation based on a detailed simulation of CIMR plus infrared observations and the processing of global SST analyses with 0.05 degrees final grid resolution. Simulations of CIMR data including structured errors were added to an observing system consisting of the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on Sentinel-3A and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on MetOp-A. This resulted in a large improvement in the global root-mean-square error (RMSE) for SST from 0.37 K to 0.21 K for January and 0.40 K to 0.25 K for July. There was a particularly noticeable improvement in the performance of the analysis, as measured by the reduction in RMSE, for dynamical and persistently cloudy areas. Of these, the Aghulas Current showed an improvement of 43% in January and 48% in July, the Gulf Stream showed 70% and 44% improvements, the Southern Ocean showed 57% and 74% improvements, and the Maritime Continent showed 50% and 40% improvements, respectively.

TI  - Exceptionally High 2018 Equilibrium Line Altitude on Taku Glacier, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP) has been examining the glaciers of the Juneau Icefield since 1946. The height of the transient snowline (TSL) at the end of the summer represents the annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA) for the glacier, where ablation equals accumulation. On Taku Glacier the ELA has been observed annually from 1946 to 2018. Since 1998 multiple annual observations of the TSL in satellite imagery identify both the migration rate of the TSL and ELA. The mean ELA has risen 85 +/- 10 m from the 1946-1985 period to the 1986-2018 period. In 2018 the TSL was observed at: 900 m on 5 July; 975 m on 21 July; 1075 m on 30 July; 1400 m on 16 September; and 1425 m on 1 October. This is the first time since 1946 that the TSL has reached or exceeded 1250 m on Taku Glacier. The 500 m TSL rise from 5 July to 30 July, 8.0. md(-1), is the fastest rate of rise observed. This combined with the observed balance gradient in this region yields an ablation rate of 40-43 mmd(-1), nearly double the average ablation rate. On 22 July a snow pit was completed at 1405 m with 0.93 m w.e. (water equivalent), that subsequently lost all snow cover, prior to 16 September. This is one of eight snow pits completed in July providing field data to verify the ablation rate. The result of the record ELA and rapid ablation is the largest negative annual balance of Taku Glacier since records began in 1946.

TI  - Risk of Low Productivity is Dependent on Farm Characteristics: How to Turn Poor Performance into an Advantage
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The principle role of agriculture is to produce food for the increasing human population. However, the environmental footprint needs to be simultaneously reduced. Data from the Finnish Food Authority (181,108 parcels in the south-western crop production region of Finland) were used to identify the farming system, farm type, farm size, field parcel scale, physical parcel characteristics, cultivated crops, crop rotations and cultivars. Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were used to identify fields with very low productivity. Thereby, the impacts of farm and field characteristics on risks of low NDVI values and their associated means of coping by the farmer were studied. High variations in field parcel characteristics and growth capacity were typical in the studied area. Although it is challenging for farmers, high variation can provide many opportunities for the development of multifunctional and resource-smart production systems, e.g., by optimizing land use: allocating high-quality fields for food production, and poorly performing fields for extensification, i.e., the production of environmental benefits. Many usable policy instruments are available to support such a transition, but more focus should be put onto the most efficient means to enable progress towards environmentally, economically and socially sustainable high-latitude agricultural systems.

TI  - Estimating the Aboveground Biomass for Planted Forests Based on Stand Age and Environmental Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at local to regional scales is critical to understanding their role in regional and global carbon cycles. The Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TNSFP) is the largest ecological restoration project in the world, and has been ongoing for over 40 years. In this study, we developed models to estimate the planted forest aboveground biomass (PF_AGB) for Yulin, a typical area in the project. Surface reflectances in the study area from 1978 to 2013 were obtained from Landsat series images, and integrated forest z-scores were constructed to measure afforestation and the stand age of planted forest. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was combined with stand age to develop an initial model to estimate PF_AGB. We then developed additional models that added environment variables to our initial model, including climatic factors (average temperature, total precipitation, and total sunshine duration) and a topography factor (slope). The model which combined the total precipitation and slope greatly improved the accuracy of PF_AGB estimation compared to the initial model, indicating that the environmental variables related to water distribution indirectly affected the growth of the planted forest and the resulting AGB. Afforestation in the study area occurred mainly in the early 1980s and early 21st century, and the PF_AGB in 2003 was 2.3 times than that of 1998, since the fourth term TNSFP started in 2000. The PF_AGB in 2013 was about 3.33 times of that in 2003 because many young trees matured. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach showed that our estimated PF_AGB had a significant correlation with field-measured data (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.89, p < 0.001, root mean square error (RMSE) = 6.79 t/ha). Our studies provided a method to estimate long time series PF_AGB using satellite repetitive measures, particularly for arid or semi-arid areas.

TI  - Modelling riparian forest distribution and composition to entire river networks
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Developing a methodology to map the distribution of riparian forests to entire river networks and determining the main environmental factors controlling their spatial patterns. Location: Cantabrian region, northern Spain. Methods: We mapped the riparian forests at a physiognomic and phytosociological level by delimiting riparian zones and generating vegetation distribution models based on remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI and LiDAR PNOA). We built virtual watersheds to define a spatial framework where the catchment environmental information can be specified for each river reach, in combination with the vegetation map. In order to determine the drivers that play a significant role in the observed spatial patterns in riparian forests, based on our data sets we modelled interactions between environmental information and riparian vegetation by using the Random Forest algorithm. Results: The modelling results obtained reliably reproduced the variation of riparian forest structure and composition across Cantabrian watersheds. The produced maps were highly accurate, with a more than 70% overall accuracy for forest occurrence. A clear differentiation between Eurosiberian (habitats 91E0 and 9160) and Mediterranean (92E0) riparian forests was shown on both sides of the mountain range. Topography and land use were the main drivers defining the distribution of riparian forest as a physiognomic unit. In turn, altitude, climate and percentage of pasture were the most relevant factors determining their composition (phytosociological approach). Conclusions: Our study confirms that anthropic control ultimately defines the distribution of vegetation in the riparian area at a regional to local scale. Human disturbances constrain the extension of forest patches across their potential distribution defined by topoclimatic boundaries, which establish a clear limit between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian biogeographical regions.

TI  - Using 3D robust smoothing to fill land surface temperature gaps at the continental scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products has been widely applied in environmental studies, and natural disaster management. However missing data in space and time due to cloud contamination, cloud shadows and atmospheric conditions has hindered its application. Accurate gap filling algorithms for a large spatiotemporal scale of LST data are necessary to enhance the utility of this product. This study applied a three-dimensional (3-D) gap-filling method to fill gaps in 9 years of LST data over Australia (2002-2011). As the gap-filling method relies on a smoothing parameter that controls the accuracy of the reconstruction algorithm, we estimated optimal smoothing parameters to separately reconstruct daytime and nighttime LST products. The reconstructed LST were validated against ground-based LST obtained from the OzFlux network and recommendations made on appropriate smoothing parameters. The results demonstrate that the gap-filling algorithm provides an accurate approach to generating reconstructed LST products for a long period over large spatial scales.

TI  - Mitotic rate as an important prognostic factor in cutaneous malignant melanoma
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recently, the quantification of mitoses in cutaneous melanoma has been discharged from the main prognostic variables of the TNM classification. Objective To investigate the prognostic value of the presence of mitoses in primary cutaneous melanoma and to establish the number of mitoses per mm(2) that may have prognostic significance. Methods A retrospective observational study was performed on 141 patients treated for cutaneous melanoma, who were assessed by the same pathologist, and who had a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Clinical, epidemiological, histopathological and follow-up variables were gathered and compared with the number of mitoses to distinguish the significance of differences by means of univariate, multivariate, and survival analyses. Results The cut-off level related to a better sensitivity and specificity was 1.50 mitoses per mm(2). The presence of two or more mitoses/mm(2) showed a better relationship with prognostic variables and both the overall and disease-free survival than the presence of 1 or more mitoses/mm(2). This happens especially in melanomas thicker than 0.8 mm and it could affect the staging in cases with Breslow between 1 and 2 mm. Conclusions A mitotic rate of two or more mitoses per mm(2) in cutaneous melanoma should be considered as a more accurate prognostic factor than one or more mitoses per mm(2), particularly in tumors equal or greater than 0.8 mm in thickness.

TI  - Assessment of Phytoecological Variability by Red-Edge Spectral Indices and Soil-Landscape Relationships
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a relation of vegetation physiognomies with soil and geological conditions that can be represented spatially with the support of remote sensing data. The goal of this research was to map vegetation physiognomies in a mountainous area by using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data and morphometrical covariates through data mining techniques. The research was based on red-edge (RE) bands, and indices, to classify phytophysiognomies at two taxonomic levels. The input data was pixel sampled based on field sample sites. Data mining procedures comprised covariate selection and supervised classification through the Random Forest model. Results showed the potential of bands 3, 5, and 6 to map phytophysiognomies for both seasons, as well as Green Chlorophyll (CLg) and SAVI indices. NDVI indices were important, particularly those calculated with bands 6, 7, 8, and 8A, which were placed at the RE position. The model performance showed reasonable success to Kappa index 0.72 and 0.56 for the first and fifth taxonomic level, respectively. The model presented confusion between Broadleaved dwarf-forest, Parkland Savanna, and Bushy grassland. Savanna formations occurred variably in the area while Bushy grasslands strictly occur in certain landscape positions. Broadleaved forests presented the best performance (first taxonomic level), and among its variation (fifth level) the model could precisely capture the pattern for those on deep soils from gneiss parent material. The approach was thus useful to capture intrinsic soil-plant relationships and its relation with remote sensing data, showing potential to map phytophysiognomies in two distinct taxonomic levels in poorly accessible areas.

TI  - Spatial deforestation patterns and the accuracy of deforestation mapping for the Brazilian Legal Amazon
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1988, the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (Institute Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE) has been executing the annual inventory of forest cover loss in the Legal Amazon using satellite data under the Program for Deforestation Monitoring in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES). This survey comprises mapping more than four million squared kilometers and the produced information are employed by the Brazilian government to evaluate and establish public policies related to the control and counter deforestation. This data has been produced and published annually since 1988. However, its accuracy is not known. Therefore, this work objective is to develop a methodology to estimate the accuracy of the deforested areas mapped by PRODES for the year 2014 using stratified sampling of the deforestation patterns mapped in 50 by 50 Km cells. Mapping these patterns was accomplished by establishing and using a typology of deforestation patterns, landscape metrics and data mining techniques. Typical sample points of each deforestation pattern of were randomly drawn and analyzed visually by independent experts. This evaluation results established that the global accuracy level of the mapping under study is estimated to be 93%, with omission and commission indices estimates being 7% and 1.5%, respectively. Patterns such as fishbone, multidirectional and consolidated ones, which are considered the most complexes, present the lowest indexes of correctness, showing coherence and indicating that they should be mapped with more rigor. The presented results are consistent in a general way, indicating that the developed methodology can be applied to similar mappings.

TI  - Landsats 1-5 Multispectral Scanner System Sensors Radiometric Calibration Update
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - First launched in 1972, the Landsat satellite sensors have provided the longest continuous record of high-quality images of the earth's surface that are used in both civilian and military applications. The Landsat Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) sensor was onboard Landsat-1 through Landsat-5. In fact, the MSS sensors provide the only systematic global multi-spectral space-based imagery of the earth's surface from 1972 to 1982. This paper focuses on the radiometric calibration update of the Landsats 1-5 MSS sensors. The radiometric calibration was performed in both radiance- and reflectance-based scales through the cross-calibration approach. Simultaneous or near-simultaneous image collections were available for MSS sensor pairs and used for the cross-calibration. The estimated uncertainties for this calibration update exhibit progressively decreasing calibration accuracy, ranging from 5.1% for MSS-5 to 8.8% for MSS-1 in the green spectral band, for example. Finally, the new radiometric calibration coefficients were validated through the use of pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS). The temporal Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) radiance and TOA reflectance over the Sonoran Desert were plotted with the purpose of verifying the lifetime radiometric stability of MSS sensors. With the previous calibration, the agreement between the measurements of TOA reflectance over the Sonoran Desert was around 7.5% for all spectral bands. With the calibration update implemented in this study, the agreement between MSS sensors is 3.6%, 2.9%, 3.5%, and 5.9% for the green, red, near-infrared response (NIR-1), and NIR-2 spectral bands, respectively. This study ties all the Landsat legacy instruments from Landsat-1 MSS through Landsat-8 OLI to a consistent radiometric

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in Northern Coastal Bay of Bengal Using Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI Sensors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a can be used as a proxy for phytoplankton and thus is an essential water quality parameter. The presence of phytoplankton in the ocean causes selective absorption of light by chlorophyll-a pigment resulting in change of the ocean color that can be identified by ocean color remote sensing. The accuracy of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) estimated from remote sensing sensors depends on the bio-optical algorithm used for the retrieval in specific regional waters. In this work, it is attempted to estimate Chl-a from two currently active satellite sensors with relatively good spatial resolutions considering ocean applications. Suitability of two standard bio-optical Ocean Color (OC) Chlorophyll algorithms, OC-2 (2-band) and OC-3 (3-band) in estimating Chl-a for turbid waters of the northern coastal Bay of Bengal is assessed. Validation with in-situ data showed that OC-2 algorithm gives an estimate of Chl-a with a better correlation of 0.795 and least bias of 0.35 mg/m(3). Further, inter-comparison of Chl-a retrieved from the two sensors, Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI was also carried out. The variability of Chl-a during winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons over the study region were inter-compared. It is observed that during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, Chl-a from MSI is over estimated compared to OLI. This work is a preliminary step toward estimation of Chl-a in the coastal oceans utilizing available better spatially resolved sensors.

TI  - Current state of surgical management for male breast cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Management guidelines for male breast cancer have long been extrapolated from those for female breast cancer, which are based on large, randomised-controlled trials. While there are no randomised-controlled trials for male breast cancer management mainly due to the rarity of the disease, the only type of evidence available comes from retrospective studies, subject to selection biases and small sample sizes. Male breast cancer, while similar to female breast cancer in many respects, has some important differences that can affect management choices. Most cancers are oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and usually more advanced at presentation than female breast cancer. This is likely due to less breast parenchyma in male patients and delay to diagnosis. The classical management option for male patients with breast cancer is mastectomy, due to small tumour-to-breast ratio and often central position of the tumour. Breast conserving surgery is still useful in selected cases and has similar outcomes when compared to mastectomies in these patients. For patients with clinically negative lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node biopsy offers the same prognosis as axillary lymph node dissection, but with less associated morbidity. Endocrine therapy is of particular use, due to high levels of receptor positivity. Adjuvant endocrine therapy seems to significantly improve overall survival of male patients with breast cancer and while no prospective evidence exists for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, there is hope that this is a useful management option as well. Radiotherapy is also useful in an adjuvant setting, particularly when combined with endocrine therapy. Better identification of patients, less delay from presentation to diagnosis and more collaborative efforts are key in improving the management, prognosis and outcomes of patients with male breast cancer.

TI  - Annual continuous fields of woody vegetation structure in the Lower Mekong region from 2000-2017 Landsat time-series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and temporally consistent vegetation structure time-series have great potential to improve the capacity for national land cover monitoring, to reduce latency and cost of international reporting, and to harmonize regional land cover characterizations. Here we present a semi-automatic, operational algorithm for mapping and monitoring of woody vegetation canopy cover and height at a regional scale using freely available Landsat time series data. The presented algorithm employs automatic data processing and mapping using a set of lidar-based vegetation structure prediction models. Changes in vegetation cover are detected separately and integrated into the structure time-series. Sample-based validation and inter-comparison with existing datasets demonstrates the spatial and temporal consistency of our regional data time-series. The dataset reliably reflects changes in tree cover (tree cover loss user's accuracy of 0.84 and producer's accuracy of 0.75) and can serve as a tool to map annual forest extent (user's accuracy of 0.98 and producer's accuracy of 0.81 for 10% canopy cover threshold to define the forest class). The tree height estimates are consistent with a GLAS-based global map (mean average error of 3.7 m, the correlation coefficient of 0.92 and the R-2 of 0.85). The algorithm was prototyped within the Lower Mekong region where it revealed an intensive woody vegetation dynamic. Of the year 2000 forest area (defined using canopy cover threshold of 10% and tree height threshold of 5 m), 9.4% was deforested by the year 2017, and 16.6% was affected by stand-replacement disturbance followed by reforestation. The average annual area of stand-level forest disturbance within the region was 2.34 Mha, and increased by 34% from 2001 (1.85 Mha) to 2017 (2.48 Mha). Total forest area decreased by 6.2% within the region, and 11.1% of year 2000 primary forest area was lost by 2017. At the national level, Cambodia demonstrated the highest rate of deforestation, with a net forest area loss of 22.5%. We estimated that 21.3% of 2017 forest cover had an age of 17 years or less, illustrating the intensive forest land uses within the region. The time-series product is suitable for mapping annual land cover and inter-annual land cover change using customized class definitions. The regionally-consistent data are publicly available for download (https://glad.umd.edu/), and online analysis (https://rlcms-servir.adpc.net/en/forest-monitor/), and serve as an input to the SERVIR-Mekong Regional Land Cover Monitoring System.

TI  - Multidrug-Resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. in Houseflies and Blowflies from Farms and Their Environmental Settings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is rising globally at an alarming rate. While multiple active surveillance programs have been established to monitor the antimicrobial resistance, studies on the environmental link to antimicrobial spread are lacking. Methods: A total of 493 flies were trapped from a dairy unit, a dog kennel, a poultry farm, a beef cattle unit, an urban trash facility and an urban downtown area to isolate Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus spp. for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular characterization. Results: E. coli, K. pneumoniae and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were recovered from 43.9%, 15.5% and 66.2% of the houseflies, and 26.0%, 19.2%, 37.0% of the blowflies, respectively. In total, 35.3% of flies were found to harbor antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and 9.0% contained multidrug-resistant isolates. Three Staphylococcus aureus isolates were recovered from blowflies while three extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-carrying E. coli and one ESBL-carrying K. pneumoniae were isolated from houseflies. Whole genome sequencing identified the antimicrobial resistance genes bla(CMY-2) and bla(CTXM-1) as ESBLs. Conclusion: Taken together, our data indicate that flies can be used as indicators for environmental contamination of antimicrobial resistance. More extensive studies are warranted to explore the sentinel role of flies for antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Landsat-8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, and WorldView-3 Multispectral Satellite Imagery for Prospecting Copper-Gold Mineralization in the Northeastern Inglefield Mobile Belt (IMB), Northwest Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several regions in the High Arctic still lingered poorly explored for a variety of mineralization types because of harsh climate environments and remoteness. Inglefield Land is an ice-free region in northwest Greenland that contains copper-gold mineralization associated with hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages. In this study, Landsat-8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and WorldView-3 multispectral remote sensing data were used for hydrothermal alteration mapping and mineral prospecting in the Inglefield Land at regional, local, and district scales. Directed principal components analysis (DPCA) technique was applied to map iron oxide/hydroxide, Al/Fe-OH, Mg-Fe-OH minerals, silicification (Si-OH), and SiO2 mineral groups using specialized band ratios of the multispectral datasets. For extracting reference spectra directly from the Landsat-8, ASTER, and WorldView-3 (WV-3) images to generate fraction images of end-member minerals, the automated spectral hourglass (ASH) approach was implemented. Linear spectral unmixing (LSU) algorithm was thereafter used to produce a mineral map of fractional images. Furthermore, adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) algorithm was applied to visible and near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VINR + SWIR) bands of ASTER using laboratory reflectance spectra extracted from the USGS spectral library for verifying the presence of mineral spectral signatures. Results indicate that the boundaries between the Franklinian sedimentary successions and the Etah metamorphic and meta-igneous complex, the orthogneiss in the northeastern part of the Cu-Au mineralization belt adjacent to Dallas Bugt, and the southern part of the Cu-Au mineralization belt nearby Marshall Bugt show high content of iron oxides/hydroxides and Si-OH/SiO2 mineral groups, which warrant high potential for Cu-Au prospecting. A high spatial distribution of hematite/jarosite, chalcedony/opal, and chlorite/epidote/biotite were identified with the documented Cu-Au occurrences in central and southwestern sectors of the Cu-Au mineralization belt. The calculation of confusion matrix and Kappa Coefficient proved appropriate overall accuracy and good rate of agreement for alteration mineral mapping. This investigation accomplished the application of multispectral/multi-sensor satellite imagery as a valuable and economical tool for reconnaissance stages of systematic mineral exploration projects in remote and inaccessible metallogenic provinces around the world, particularly in the High Arctic regions.

TI  - Global Sensitivity Analysis of the SCOPE Model in Sentinel-3 Bands: Thermal Domain Focus
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-3 satellite has provided simultaneous observations in the optical (visible, near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR)) and thermal infrared (TIR) domains since 2016, with a revisit time of 1-2 days. The high temporal resolution and spectral coverage make the data of this mission attractive for vegetation monitoring. This study explores the possibilities of using the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model together with Sentinel-3 to exploit the two sensors onboard of Sentinel-3 (the ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) and sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR)) in synergy. Sobol' variance based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance produced with a coupled SCOPE-6S model was conducted for optical bands of OLCI and SLSTR, while another GSA of SCOPE was conducted for the land surface temperature (LST) product of SLSTR. The results show that in addition to ESA level-2 Sentinel-3 products, SCOPE is able to retrieve leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf water content (Cw), leaf senescent material (Cs), leaf inclination distribution (LAD). Leaf dry matter content (Cdm) and soil brightness, despite being important, were not confidently retrieved in some cases. GSA of LST in TIR domain showed that plant biochemical parameters-maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and stomata conductance-photosynthesis slope (Ball-Berry m)-can be constrained if prior information on near-surface weather conditions is available. We conclude that the combination of optical and thermal domains facilitates the constraint of the land surface energy balance using SCOPE.

TI  - Supply and Demand Assessment of Solar PV as Off-Grid Option in Asia Pacific Region with Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in isolated areas which are far from the main grid has provided energy to non-electrified households. Such off-grid technology is very promising in the Asia Pacific region where increase in population and regional development has brought an increase in energy demand. This paper presents a methodology to assess the available supply of energy from solar PV systems and the corresponding demand from non-electrified areas. Non-electrified high population density areas were extracted using global population distribution and nightlight data, while the suitability of installing solar PV systems in those areas were identified based on slope, land cover and estimated solar PV power output. Moreover, the cost and benefits of installation were estimated based on the levelized cost of electricity generation from PV (LCOEPV) and the percentage in the total household budget that can shoulder the said expense. Lastly, this study also proposed a novel and simple method to extract the power transmission lines (TLs) based on global road network and nightlight data used for defining off-grid areas. Results show that there are three general types of electrification trend in the region with only 11 out 28 countries exhibiting the ideal trend of decreasing population living in unlit areas with increasing GDP. This study also generated maps showing the spatial distribution of high potential areas for solar PV installation in Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as case studies. To date, the high estimated household income allotted for PV electricity is still experienced in most countries in the region, but these countries also have high initial generated electricity from PV systems. Outputs from this study can provide stakeholders with relevant information on the suitable areas for installations in the region and the expected socio-economic benefits.

TI  - Fast velocity estimation method for moving targets based on complex SAR image
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast estimation of ship velocity remains a significant gap in ocean applications despite the increasing interest in space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study proposed a fast velocity estimation method for moving targets based on complex SAR image. Here, the authors first applied several defocusing filters to the imagining results, estimating the along-track velocity of all moving targets by discerning the differences in the maximum of the filtered images. They then derived the cross-track velocity based on Doppler centroid drift. The results showed that the proposed method is effective in real TerraSAR-X dataset and is able to estimate velocity for moving targets in SAR complex image.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-2 fAPAR products using ground observations across three forest ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) such as the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) are essential for assessing global carbon balances. ESA's Sentinel-2 (S2) mission with its decametric resolution enables to derive fAPAR information at single forest stand. Validation studies on previously existing satellite-derived fAPAR products have found considerable discrepancies, especially in forest ecosystems that exceed relative discrepancies of 10% (i.e. 0.05 for absolute values) set as target accuracy by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).This study presents the validation of S2 fAPAR products using direct radiation measurements of 2017 at three different forests, located in Central Europe (mixed-coniferous forest in temperate mid-latitude), North America (boreal-deciduous forest) and Central America (tropical dry forest, TDF). We measured incoming and transmitted PAR every 10 min synchronously using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and calculated a two-flux fAPAR estimate. We validated the S2 fAPAR product with different instantaneous ground fAPAR estimates (e.g. instantaneous fAPAR at 10:00 and 14:00 local solar time) and daily average fAPAR. We considered uncertainties of ground data, i.e. bias related to the presence of colored autumn leaves and influences of solar zenith angle.Overall, we found high discrepancies between the S2 fAPAR product and ground measurements, indicating that the S2 fAPAR product systematically underestimated (negative values for bias in percent) the ground observations. The highest agreement was observed at the boreal-deciduous forest stand with a bias of -13% (R-2 = 0.67). The Central American and European sites reported deviations of -20% (R-2 = 0.68) and -25% (R-2 = 0.26), respectively. At all sites, we found evidence that particularly the influence of colored leaves during the senescence periods lead to bias of the ground data. Further, the choice of temporal fAPAR estimate, i.e. daily average fAPAR or a certain instantaneous fAPAR estimate, lead to partly different results in the correlation analysis with the S2 fAPAR product. However, considering sources of uncertainties of ground data, we emphasize that only the boreal-deciduous site in Canada fulfilled the accuracy requirements set by the GCOS.In contrast to absolute values, we found strong agreement on phenological changes at all three sites. Specifically, the influence of species composition on seasonal variability of fAPAR across the European mixed coniferous site was well-represented in the S2 fAPAR product. As for the representation of spatial variability, we found highest agreement at the boreal-deciduous forest stand (BIAS = -22%, R-2 = 0.93), whereas spatial variability was least represented at the TDF site (BIAS = 125%, R-2 = 0.97). We conclude that the S2 fAPAR product has strong capabilities for assessing temporal variability of fAPAR, but due to low accuracy of absolute values currently limited options to feed global production efficiency models and assess global carbon balances.

TI  - Forest biomass estimation over three distinct forest types using TanDEM-X InSAR data and simulated GEDI lidar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission has been successfully launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on December 5th, 2018. While the sampling pattern of GEDI (8 transects with about 600 m across-track spacing) is sufficient to provide accurate biomass maps at the mission's required gridded resolution of 1 km, it is of significant interest to fuse GEDI data with ancillary, wall-to-wall remote sensing data from other sensors to provide increased accuracy, potentially higher resolution, and to fill gaps caused by track spacing, clumping in the ISS orbital tracks, as well as from clouds. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining simulated GEDI lidar observations with acquisitions from DLR's TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TDX) InSAR mission to improve forest biomass estimation at a moderate resolution of 1 km, and to produce biomass maps at a much finer resolution of one hectare. We statistically characterize uncertainties before and after fusing simulated GEDI observations with TDX data across three different biomes: a temperate mixed deciduous forest, a temperate and mountainous coniferous forest, and a tropical forest. We implement the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model to derive canopy heights from TDX, using GEDI observations to parameterize key variables in the model. Our uncertainty framework is based on application of what are known as hybrid and hierarchical model-based inference, which allows for the parametric estimation of the variance of biomass estimation using both sampled and modeled data. We found improved accuracies after applying our fusion methods, with uncertainties at 1 km resolution ranging from 11%-20% across the different study sites of the mean biomass from the use of GEDI data alone, compared to 7%-12% achieved after the fusion. At one hectare resolution, comparison of the fusion derived biomass with field plots showed uncertainties associated with mean biomass predictions between 11%-27% across sites. Our results suggest that the use of ancillary data that are sensitive to biomass, such as heights from TDX, with observations of ecosystem structure from GEDI, has the potential to both improve accuracies and/or provide finer spatial resolution, than what is achievable through either mission by itself. We further demonstrate that the GEDI data themselves may be used to parameterize models that invert height from TDX, leading to more accurate height maps for use in biomass estimation. Lastly, our results illustrate the benefits of using parametric estimation theory to quantify uncertainties from both sampling and modeling errors that arise in the fusion of multi-modal remote sensing data at various spatial scales.

TI  - Crop Growth Condition Assessment at County Scale Based on Heat-Aligned Growth Stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data have been used in crop condition monitoring for decades. Traditionally, crop growth conditions were assessed by comparing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the current year and past years at a pixel scale on the same calendar day. The assumption of this comparison is that the different years' crops were at the same growing stage on the same day. However, this assumption is often violated in reality. This paper proposes to combine remotely sensed data and meteorological data to assess corn growth conditions at the same growth stages at county level. The proposed approach uses the active accumulated temperature (AAT) computed from Daymet, a daily weather data product, to align different years of NDVI time series at the same growth stages estimated from AATs. The study area covers Carroll County, Iowa. The best index slope extraction (BISE) method and Savitzky-Golay filter are used to filter noise and to reconstruct 11 years of corn growing season NDVI time series from 250 m MODIS daily surface reflectance data product (MOD09GQ). The corn growth stages are identified every year with precise Julian dates from AAT time series. The corn growth conditions are assessed based on the aligned growth stages. The validation of the assessed crop conditions is performed based on National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports. The study indicates that the crop condition assessment results based on aligned growth stages are consistent with the NASS reported results and they are more reliable than the results based on the same calendar days. The proposed method provides not only crop growth condition information but also crop phenology information. Potentially, it can help improve crop yield prediction since it can effectively measure crop growth changes with NDVI and AAT data.

TI  - ECRG4: a new potential target in precision medicine
T2  - FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Given the rapid development in precision medicine, tremendous efforts have been devoted to discovering new biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment. Esophageal cancer-related gene-4 (ECRG4), which is initially known as a new candidate tumor suppressor gene, is emerging as a sentinel molecule for gauging tissue homeostasis. ECRG4 is unique in its cytokine-like functional pattern and epigenetically-regulated gene expression pattern. The gene can be released from the cell membrane upon activation and detected in liquid biopsy, thus offering considerable potential in precision medicine. This review provides an updated summary on the biology of ECRG4, with emphasis on its important roles in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The future perspectives of ECRG4 as a potential molecular marker in precision medicine are also discussed in detail.

TI  - Finer Resolution Estimation and Mapping of Mangrove Biomass Using UAV LiDAR and WorldView-2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To estimate mangrove biomass at finer resolution, such as at an individual tree or clump level, there is a crucial need for elaborate management of mangrove forest in a local area. However, there are few studies estimating mangrove biomass at finer resolution partly due to the limitation of remote sensing data. Using WorldView-2 imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and field survey datasets, we proposed a novel method for the estimation of mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB) at individual tree level, i.e., individual tree-based inference method. The performance of the individual tree-based inference method was compared with the grid-based random forest model method, which directly links the field samples with the UAV LiDAR metrics. We discussed the feasibility of the individual tree-based inference method and the influence of diameter at breast height (DBH) on individual segmentation accuracy. The results indicated that (1) The overall classification accuracy of six mangrove species at individual tree level was 86.08%. (2) The position and number matching accuracies of individual tree segmentation were 87.43% and 51.11%, respectively. The number matching accuracy of individual tree segmentation was relatively satisfying within 8 cm <= DBH <= 30 cm. (3) The individual tree-based inference method produced lower accuracy than the grid-based RF model method with R-2 of 0.49 vs. 0.67 and RMSE of 48.42 Mg ha(-1) vs. 38.95 Mg ha(-1). However, the individual tree-based inference method can show more detail of spatial distribution of mangrove AGB. The resultant AGB maps of this method are more beneficial to the fine and differentiated management of mangrove forests.

TI  - Burn Severity and Post-Fire Land Surface Albedo Relationship in Mediterranean Forest Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study explores the relationship between land surface albedo (LSA) changes and burn severity, checking whether the LSA is an indicator of burn severity, in a large forest fire (117.75 km(2), Spain). The LSA was obtained from Landsat data. In particular, we used an immediately-after-fire scene, a year-after-fire scene and a pre-fire one. The burn severity (three levels) was assessed in 111 field plots by using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The potentiality of remotely sensed LSA as an indicator for the burn severity was tested by a one-way analysis of variance, correlation analysis and regression models. Specifically, we considered the total shortwave, visible, and near-infrared LSA. Immediately after the fire, we observed a decrease in the LSA for all burn severity levels (up to 0.631). A small increase in the LSA was found (up to 0.0292) a year after the fire. The maximum adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)) of the linear regression model between the immediately post-fire LSA image and the CBI values was approximately 67%. Fisher's least significance difference test showed that two burn severity levels could be discriminated by the immediately post-fire LSA image. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude of the changes in the LSA is related to the burn severity with a statistical significance, suggesting the potentiality of immediately-after-fire remotely sensed LSA for estimating the burn severity as an alternative to other satellite-based methods. However, the persistency of these changes in time should be evaluated in future research.

TI  - Sentinel Node Lymph Node Surgery After Neoadjuvant Therapy: Principles and Techniques
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical management of the axilla in breast cancer has been a topic of great interest. While sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an established approach for patients undergoing surgical treatment as the first element of their care, there is continued debate regarding surgical management of the axilla in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In clinically node-negative patients, it has been debated whether or not SLNB should be performed before chemotherapy to accurately determine the clinical stage, or after chemotherapy, thus prioritizing the response to therapy and potentially minimizing axillary surgery. Node-positive patients have undergone axillary lymph node dissection in the past, however this paradigm has been challenged in recent years. Thus, surgeons must understand the importance of accurate axillary information both before and after NAC, and its role in multidisciplinary planning. We present a summary of the data surrounding axillary management in patients receiving NAC, and recommendations for surgical technique.

T2  - ANTHROPOLOGY SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 54th national conference of the African National Congress, the ruling party in South Africa, resolved amongst other things to review the country's constitution such that it enables the government to implement land expropriation without compensation. This resolution has faced an array of contestations, ranging from the question of the original owners of the land to that of ownership in relation to title deeds. However, the contestations seem to be premised on an understanding of identity as fixed and of land as a commodity. Whilst there is significant literature on the different understanding of identity and land from an African perspective, there is very little consideration of this worldview in the debates on land. It would seem that African societies are understood as a "field from which to mine raw data," as Nhemachena has stated, but not as having fully developed knowledge systems that can inform the debates and discourses on land. The expression singabantu bendawo [we are people of this place], which was commonly used by community members of Esihlengeni in KwaZulu-Natal province, reveals an understanding of identity as fluid and of land as a place of belonging.

TI  - Change Vector Analysis, Tasseled Cap, and NDVI-NDMI for Measuring Land Use/Cover Changes Caused by a Sudden Short-Term Severe Drought: 2011 Texas Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sudden short-term severe droughts have major impacts on ecosystem balance. Synoptic and replicable measurements from remotely sensed data are essential for calculating changes to land use/cover caused by severe drought conditions. In the US, Texas experienced a particularly severe drought in 2011, which adversely affected forest and grassland ecosystems in addition to $7.62 billion of agricultural loss. To assess the extent and severity of the drought we use satellite sensor data and image processing techniques to measure changes in land use/cover. Our methodology uses change vector analysis (CVA), the normalized difference vegetation index, the normalized difference moisture index, and three variables-brightness, greenness, and wetness-extracted from tasseled cap transforms (TCT). All are established techniques in remote sensing but have as yet been applied in combination to measure land use/cover changes affected by intense short-term drought conditions. Our objective is to calculate not only vegetation and bare soil indices, but also the intensity of change (magnitude) and the type of change (direction). For CVA direction, we include an improved methodology using the arctangent function based on two arguments, ATAN2 which produces results in all four possible quadrants, and complete characterization of all possible change directions. The three variables of TCT are applied to CVA magnitude and direction using vectors in three dimensions, resulting in eight change categories. Our results are based on Landsat TM sensor data for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011, which represent a short period of severe drought, above average precipitation, and severe drought respectively, for two study sites in Texas. Results indicate that land use/cover changes were affected by both an increase in precipitation in 2010 as well as a considerable decrease of precipitation in 2011 resulting in the devastating sudden drought.

TI  - Assessment of accuracy of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in medially located breast cancer using methylene blue injection technique: our institute experience
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary lymph node status is the single most important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can give an idea about the axillary nodal status, with a high rate of identification. Because the upper outer quadrant is the most common site for breast cancer, most studies of SLNB of the breast have been performed in patients with breast cancer mostly located in this quadrant of the breast, whereas the medial quadrants have much been less studied. In this study, we evaluate the axillary SLNB in medially located breast cancer only, using methylene blue injection technique, regarding identification rate, accuracy rate, and false negativity rate (FNR).Patients and methods The study included 42 female patients with medially located breast cancer and negative axilla, scheduled for modified radical mastectomy or conservative breast surgery. Overall, 4 milliliters of methylene blue 1% was injected in the peritumoral tissue. Sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN) and other axillary nodes were individually sent for pathological assessment.Results Average time taken from methylene blue injection until SLN(s) identification and dissection reached 45 min. SLN identification rate was 92.9% of the patients. The number of SLN removed per patient ranged from 1 to 3 nodes. The number of axillary lymph node removed during axillary lymph node dissection ranged from 10 to 22 nodes. Accuracy rate was 88.1%, and SLN FNR was 4.8%.Conclusion Axillary SLNB is highly valid in medially located breast cancer, with high identification and accuracy rates and low FNR.

TI  - ICG lymphography and fluorescence in pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder and prostate cancer
T2  - ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: ICG navigation in cancer surgery may help during pelvic lymphadenectomy.METHODS: We performed a systematic review combining the terms: bladder cancer or radical cystectomy and ICG, and prostate cancer or radical prostatectomy and ICG. We used the PRISMA guidelines recommendations. We describe the populations studied in each work, the pathological results, as well as the parameters specificity, sensitivity and predictive values.RESULTS: In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, 4 case series analyzed the performance of lymphography with ICG. The most accepted injection method is under endoscopic vision. Several punctures are done in the submucosa and the detrusor surrounding the scar. Sentinel nodes were found in up to 92% of patients with a technique sensitivity to find metastases of 88% in the series with largest casuistry.In prostate cancer, we collected data from 11 case series. Nine of them apply transrectal or transperineal dilution immediately before surgery. Sensitivity in the detection of all adenopathies ranged between 44% and 100%. The sensitivity of the technique to know the lymph node stage ranges between 67% and 100%.CONCLUSIONS: There is little experience of ICG-guided lymph node dissedction in bladder tumors. Endoscopic fluorophore injection allows us to find the nodes that drain the infiltrated area. However, the use of this technique is not widespread. In prostate cancer, it is a reproducible and efficient technique for staging patients with prostate cancer.

TI  - Study of the Behavior of Super Resolution on Soft-Classified Output
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Once the satellite sensor is in orbit, no hardware enhancement of the lens assembly can be done to improve spatial and spectral resolution. Super resolution (SR) as single frame or multi-frame can solve this problem up to a large extent. In this study, single- and multi-frame SR techniques were applied and tested on Worldview-2 datasets as well as on across-spatial datasets of LISS III and LISS IV. Study of soft classifier's behavior on super-resolved images was performed through possibilistic C-means classifier. Quantitative methods based on calculation of peak signal-to-noise ratio, mean square error, root means square error, image quality index and qualitative methods of visual interpretation proved that both super-resolution methods remove outliers in an efficient way and resulted in images containing sharp edges. The single-frame super-resolution technique was found relatively inferior in terms of contrast and spatial resolution. Overall, multi-frame SR method outperformed other methods.

TI  - The Impacts of Landscape Changes on Annual Mean Land Surface Temperature in the Tropical Mountain City of Sri Lanka: A Case Study of Nuwara Eliya (1996-2017)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although urbanization has contributed to improving living conditions, it has had negative impacts on the natural environment in urbanized areas. Urbanization has changed the urban landscape and resulted in increasing land surface temperature (LST). Thus, studies related to LST in various urban environments have become popular. However, there are few LST studies focusing on mountain landscapes (i.e., hill stations). Therefore, this study investigated the changes in the landscape and their impacts on LST intensity (LSTI) in the tropical mountain city of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. The study utilized annual median temperatures extracted from Landsat data collected from 1996 to 2017 based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) interface. The fractions of built-up (BL), forested (FL) and agricultural (AL) land, were calculated using land use and cover maps based on urban-rural zone (URZ) analysis. The urban-rural margin was demarcated based on the fractions of BL (<10%), and LSTI that were measured using the mean LST difference in the urban-rural zone. Besides, the mixture of land-use types was calculated using the AL/FL and BL/FL fraction ratios, and grid-based density analysis. The results revealed that the BL in all URZs rapidly developed, while AL decreased during the period 1996 to 2017. There was a minimal change in the forest area of the Nuwara Eliya owing to the government's forest preservation policies. The mean temperature of the study area increased by 2.1 degrees C from 1996 to 2017. The magnitude of mean LST between urban-rural zones also increased from 1.0 degrees C (1996) to 3.5 degrees C (2017). The results also showed that mean LST was positively correlated with the increase and decrease of the BL/FL and AL/FL fraction ratios, respectively. The grid-based analysis showed an increasing, positive relationship between mean LST and density of BL. This indicated that BL density had been a crucial element in increasing LST in the study area. The results of this study will be a useful indicator to introduce improved landscape and urban planning in the future to minimize the negative impact of LST on urban sustainability.

TI  - A Reconfigurable Reflector Antenna System With a Hybrid Scanning Method: Imaging antennas for simultaneous multiple spot and wide coverage beams
T2  - IEEE ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit beam reconfiguration and beam scanning are the two most important features for future satellite antenna payloads. There are several ways of achieving the desired flexibility using different types of antennas and different scanning methods. This article presents singleand dual-reflector antenna systems where reconfiguration is achieved using high-gain multiple beams (HGMBs) employing imaging reflector configurations. Beam scanning over the global coverage is achieved using a combination of precise electronic scanning over a small coverage region and a coarse mechanical scanning over a wide global coverage. This method results in significant improvement in gain relative to conventional methods that employ element beams and can simultaneously provide both HGMBs and wide-area coverage beams with lowcost payloads.

TI  - Mapping potential, existing and efficient wetlands using free remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wetlands remain threatened by human pressures and climate change, monitoring and managing them are challenging due to their high spatial and temporal dynamics within a fine-grained pattern. New satellite time-series at high temporal and spatial resolutions provide a promising opportunity to map and monitor wetlands. The objective of this study was to develop an operational method for managing valley bottom wetlands based on available free remote sensing data. The Potential, Existing, Efficient Wetlands (PEEW) approach was adapted to remote sensing data to delineate three wetland components: (1) potential wetlands, mapped from a digital terrain model derived from LiDAR data; (2) existing wetlands, delineated from land cover maps derived from Sentinel-1/2 time-series; and (3) efficient wetlands, identified from functional indicators (i.e. annual primary production, vegetation phenology, seasonality of carbon flux) derived from MODIS annual time-series. Soil and vegetation samples were collected in the field to calibrate and validate classification of remote sensing data. The method was applied to a 113 000 ha watershed in northwestern France. Results show that potential wetlands were successfully delineated (82% overall accuracy) and covered 21% of the watershed area, while 44% of existing wetlands had been lost. Small wetlands along headwater channels, which are considered as ordinary, cover 56% of wetland area in the watershed. Efficient wetlands were identified as contiguous pixels with a similar temporal functional trajectory. This method, based on free remote sensing data, provides a new perspective for wetland management. The method can identify sites where restoration measures should be prioritized and enables better understanding and monitoring of the influence of management practices and climate on wetland functions.

TI  - Persistent Scatterers continuous streaming for landslide monitoring and mapping: the case of the Tuscany region (Italy)
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the continuous monitoring of ground deformation throughout the Tuscany region using radar images acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite constellation of the European Space Agency (ESA) are presented here. This new monitoring approach, based on systematic imagery processing and analysis of deformation time series, is discussed at regional (for the entire Tuscany) and at local scale in the context of a case study of the Carpineta landslide, which is a large, active earth slide in the Northern Apennines (Pistoia province). The landslide registered an acceleration during the winter and spring of 2018 as a direct consequence of rainfall and snow melt. The increase in the deformation rate of the landslide, which led to the damage of several buildings, was promptly detected and monitored due to the enhanced temporal repetitiveness offered by the Sentinel-1 constellation. The results demonstrate that advances in satellite sensors, increases in computing capacity and the refinement of processing approaches and data screening tools can contribute to the development of new paradigms in satellite-based monitoring systems. Sentinel-1 data, which are systematically acquired with short revisiting times and then promptly processed, can now be used as a tool for the systematic tracking of ground deformation at the regional scale and for the continuous monitoring of slow and very slow landslides.

TI  - A raster version of the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra biome. However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70% accuracy, up from 39% for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems.

TI  - Fallowing temporal patterns assessment in rainfed agricultural areas based on NDVI time series autocorrelation values
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fallowing is a common practice in Mediterranean areas where water scarcity becomes a limiting factor, affecting soil productivity, crop yield and biodiversity. In mainland Spain, fallow lands expand across three million hectares every year, constituting around 30% of rainfed arable lands and 6% of the national surface. There is a need of monitoring fallow lands to better map land use intensity and therefore achieve a sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture. However, most of current land use classification systems do not include lands under fallowing practices as a specific class. In this research, a new and highly operative methodology based on NDVI time series autocorrelation values to assess fallowing temporal patterns across rainfed agricultural areas is proposed. This approach was tested in mainland Spain, using the autocorrelation function of MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2012 at 250 m spatial resolution. The field observational database from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was used for validation purposes. The dataset used includes 338 pixels with annual information about the cultivated and fallowed surface within the entire study period. It was demonstrated that specific autocorrelation values at lags corresponding to one, two, and three years contained relevant information to identify lands under fallowing practices and assess their temporal pattern. Integrating autocorrelation variables in a random forest model made it possible to improve the assessment. The classification results were in agreement with the field dataset with an overall accuracy higher than 80%. Results revealed that approximately half of rainfed agricultural areas were regularly cultivated and distributed mainly in the northwestern Spain. The other half mainly located across northeast, center and south of Spain, showed crop-fallow rotation patterns. This methodology is a promising technique to map land management intensity using the entire time series in a highly operative manner. It is expected that in the near future the availability of remote sensing time series with better spatial resolution will make it possible to improve the assessment of agricultural intensification.

TI  - The Australian Northwest Cloudband: Climatology, Mechanisms, and Association with Precipitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Australian northwest cloudbands (NWCBs) are continental-scale bands of continuous cloud that stretch from northwest to southeast Australia. In earlier studies, where the characteristics of NWCBs and their relationship with precipitation were identified from satellite imagery, there was considerable uncertainty in the results due to limited quality and availability of data. The present study identifies NWCBs from 31 years of satellite data using a pattern-matching algorithm. This new climatology is the longest record based entirely on observations. Our findings include a strong annual cycle in NWCB frequency, with a summer maximum and winter minimum, and a statistically significant increase in annual NWCB days over the period 1984-2014. Physical mechanisms responsible for NWCB occurrences are explored to determine whether there is a fundamental difference between summer and winter NWCBs as hypothesized in earlier studies. Composite analyses are used to reveal that a key difference between these is their genesis mechanisms. Whereas summer NWCBs are triggered by cyclonic disturbances, winter NWCBs tend to form when meridional sea surface temperature gradients trigger baroclinic instability. It was also found that while precipitation is enhanced over parts of Australia during a cloudband day, it is reduced in other regions. During a cloudband day, precipitation extremes are more likely over northwest, central, and southeast Australia, while the probability of extreme precipitation decreases in northeast and southwest Australia. Additionally, cold fronts and NWCBs can interact, leading to enhanced rainfall over Australia.

TI  - Rapid expansion of coastal aquaculture ponds in China from Landsat observations during 1984-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing animal food production sectors mainly developed in fertile coastal areas. Monitoring and mapping of aquaculture ponds are of utmost importance for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems. In this study, an integrated updating and object-based classification approach was developed to generate maps of coastal aquaculture ponds in China from 1984 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The current extent and change of coastal aquaculture ponds in China were analyzed over the course of 32 years. In addition, spatial-temporal dynamics of coastal aquaculture ponds were examined by buffer and overlay analyses. The results showed that the total area of coastal aquaculture ponds in China expanded by 10,463 km(2), with the largest gain occurring from 1990 to 2000 (4,207 km(2)). The coastal provinces of Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Hebei had significant increases of aquaculture ponds areas, accounting for 83% of totally expanded ponds in the coastal zone of China. Rapid expansion of coastal aquaculture ponds was observed in the 0-10 km inshore buffer and the loss of wetlands and arable land contributed more than 50% to the expansion. Socio-economic factors helped drive the continual increase of coastal aquaculture ponds in China. Scientific environmental regulations and planning and management strategies at the national and international policy levels should be enhanced to consider the ecological impacts of aquaculture expansion.

TI  - Ecohydrology of Interannual Changes in Watershed Storage
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed studies often rely on the assumption that interannual storage changes are negligible in the hydrologic balance of a watershed. The assumption can be useful and is sometimes necessary, but it is widely acknowledged as unrealistic. Identifying and understanding systematic deviations from hydrologic steady state has important implications for both hydrologic research and water management. To that end, we evaluated the magnitude of interannual changes in storage for nearly 1000 watersheds in the conterminous United States for the 10-year period 2002 to 2011 using ground-based and remotely sensed data. We evaluated relationships between changes in storage (i.e., deviations from hydrologic steady state), vegetation cover, and hydroclimatic variables. Analysis of results using a Budyko framework revealed that, in general, greater evaporative partitioning led to smaller deviations from hydrologic steady state. Additional analysis using gradient boosted regression tree modeling identified an inverse relationship between forest cover and the magnitude of deviations from hydrologic steady state. In fact, modeling showed forest cover to be a stronger driver of variability in deviations from steady state than any hydroclimatic variable. We discuss ecohydrological feedbacks capable of contributing to steady-state conditions in forested watersheds, and we discuss implications of these results for the coevolution of watersheds, vegetation, and climate.

TI  - A data driven technique applying GIS, and remote sensing to rank locations for waste disposal site expansion
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfilling is the most common method for final treatment of municipal solid waste worldwide. Canadians generated 973 kg/cap of waste in 2016, and 73% of that was sent to landfills or incinerators. This study proposes a novel method which combines remote sensing and vector data to rank the suitability of current landfill sites and their area of influence for expansion in Saskatchewan, Canada; where there are currently more than 500 active landfills. This study found that using average normalized data, 55.3% of the land in the study area was suitable or moderately suitable for landfill expansion while 45% of the area was unsuitable for landfill expansion. Polygon 32, an area dominated by agriculture and pasture land, is the most suitable for landfill expansion based on the mean normalized rank and was ranked 9th (out of 39) in terms of standard deviation. Polygon 27 is the least suitable for landfill expansion, having the largest mean normalized rank, and was ranked 38th (out of 39) in terms of standard deviation. This method is advantageous compared to other decision-making tools which rely on expert opinion. This method relies solely on remote sensing and vector data; but is flexible enough that weighting of data sets can be applied by policy makers if so desired. Results show that using remote sensing data and vector data together are capable of capturing distinctly different aspects of the study area, and that vector data can be used as a proxy for imagery where cloud cover is present.

TI  - An integrated fluvial and flash pluvial model using 2D high-resolution sub-grid and particle swarm optimization-based random forest approaches in GIS
T2  - COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two types of flooding, namely fluvial flood (FF) and pluvial flash flood (PFF), exist in tropical cities located close to permanent rivers, where extreme precipitation intensity occurs. Although several methods are available for assessment of FF, however, PFF has received minimal attention from the researchers. Studies rarely presented joint FF and PFF hazards. Therefore, the current study not only aims to evaluate probability and hazards for FF and PFF independently but also implements combined FF with PFF probabilistic inundation analysis. First, an integrated model was developed to analyze probability using fully distributed geographic information system (GIS)-based algorithms. These methods were performed on Damansara River Catchment in Kuala Lumpur, because yearly monsoon triggers FFs and simultaneously coincides with heavy local rainfalls. A hydraulic 2D high-resolution sub-grid model of Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System was performed to simulate FF probability and hazard. Nine significant contributing parameters were trained with PFF inventory by GIS-based random forest (RF) model and each RF parameter was optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to model the PFF probabilistic hazard. Finally, PFF was combined with FF probabilities to discover the impact and contribution of each type of urban flood hazard. This study is the first attempt to model PFF hazard using GIS and physical-based PSO-RF model and combined FF and PFF probabilistic map. The results provide detailed flood information for urban managers to smartly equip infrastructures, such as highways, roads, and sewage network.

TI  - Applicability of ENCHANTED trial results to current acute ischemic stroke patients eligible for intravenous thrombolysis in England and Wales: Comparison with the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme registry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Randomized controlled trials provide high-level evidence, but the necessity to include selected patients may limit the generalisability of their results. Methods: Comparisons were made of baseline and outcome data between patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) recruited into the alteplase-dose arm of the international, multi-center, Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke study (ENCHANTED) in the United Kingdom (UK), and alteplase-treated AIS patients registered in the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) registry, over the study period June 2012 to October 2015. Results: There were 770 AIS patients (41.2% female; mean age 72 years) included in ENCHANTED at sites in England and Wales, which was 19.5% of alteplase-treated AIS patients registered in the SSNAP registry. Trial participants were significantly older, had lower baseline neurological severity, less likely Asian, and had more premorbid symptoms, hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Although ENCHANTED participants had higher rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage than those in SSNAP, there were no differences in onset-to-treatment time, levels of disability (assessed by the modified Rankin scale) at hospital discharge, and mortality over 90 days between groups. Conclusions: Despite the high level of participation, equipoise over the dose of alteplase among UK clinician investigators favored the inclusion of older, frailer, milder AIS patients in the ENCHANTED trial.

TI  - Mastectomy is no longer an indication for postoperative opioid prescription at discharge
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A 10-step protocol employing multimodal analgesia was implemented in patients undergoing mastectomy to decrease the quantity of opioids prescribed at discharge.Methods: Patients who received the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol were compared to a control group. Inpatient and discharge prescription of opioids were compared using oral morphine equivalents (OMEs), along with postoperative pain scores.Results: Between 2017 and 2018, fifty-seven patients were eligible for inclusion: 20 patients received ERAS and 37 received usual care (UC). The ERAS group received a mean of 2.4 (0-13) inpatient OMEs and the UC group received 13.7 (0-80) (p = 0.002). The ERAS group received 2.0 (0-40) OMEs at discharge and the UC group received 59.8 (0-120) (p <0.001). Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in the patients who received the ERAS protocol.Conclusions: Patients who received the ERAS protocol required less postoperative opioids and reported lower pain scores when compared to a control group.

TI  - Decreasing rates of axillary lymph node dissections over time: Implications for surgical resident exposure and operative skills development
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 71st Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society-of-Surgical-Oncology
CL  - Chicago, IL
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy has supplanted axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in clinically node-negative breast cancer and select node-positive disease. We hypothesized a decreasing rate of both ALND and resident exposure over time.Methods: We identified women with clinical Stage I-Ill breast cancer in the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2014). Adjusted multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of various factors on receipt of ALND. Yearly procedural rates for residents were extracted from surgical case log reports for comparison against procedural rates.Results: 1,131,363 patients were identified; 255,306 received ALND, 876,057 underwent non-ALND management. ALND rates declined from 2004 (32%) to 2014 (16%, p <0.001), with the largest decline occurring between 2010 and 2011 (24%-20%). After adjustment, this effect was maintained, with ALND rates decreasing with each additional year (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.89-0.90). Resident procedure volumes similarly declined from 1999 to 2017 (p <0.001).Conclusions: Significant declines in both ALND rates and procedural volume in residency may impact outcomes, as ALNDs are being performed in ever more challenging oncologic scenarios by potentially less-experienced surgeons.

TI  - AN INVESTIGATION OF DROUGHT AROUND CHI WATERSHED DURING TEN-YEAR PERIOD USING TERRA/MODIS DATA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To examine the drought affected area is highly challenging because the drought is a natural disaster that starts and expands slowly. The severity of the drought is different when the rainfall is imbalance in the area. The objective of this study was to analyze the drought around Chi watershed with total area of 49,131.920 km(2) by using data from Terra/MODIS satellite during 10 years (2007-2016). On part of method operation, the NDVI data was obtained from Terra/MODIS satellite, and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) analysis was performed to examine the condition of plants which could identify the condition of drought in the area. According to the study, it was found that in 2015, it was the time when the drought affected area was at most which was equal to 91.54 percent, or 44975.23 km(2). When the analysis results of these ten years were brought to find relationship with rainfall, it was found that the decision coefficient was R-2 = 0.913. It can be concluded from the results of this study that VCI could be used as indicator and could identify the drought in Chi watershed in terms of area and time reasonably.

TI  - <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> Oocyst Infectivity Assessed Using a Sporocyst-Based Cell Culture Assay Combined with Quantitative PCR for Environmental Applications
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous foodborne protozoan that can infect humans at low dose and displays different prevalences among countries in the world. Ingestion of food or water contaminated with small amounts of T. gondii oocysts may result in human infection. However, there are no regulations for monitoring oocysts in food, mainly because of a lack of standardized methods to detect them. The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a reliable method, applicable in biomonitoring, for the rapid detection of infectious oocysts by cell culture of their sporocysts combined with quantitative PCR (sporocyst-CC-qPCR) and (ii) to adapt this method to blue and zebra mussels experimentally contaminated by oocysts with the objective to use these organisms as sentinels of aquatic environments. Combining mechanical treatment and bead beating leads to the release of 84% +/- 14% of free sporocysts. The sporocyst-CC-qPCR detected fewer than ten infectious oocysts in water within 4 days (1 day of contact and 3 days of cell culture) compared to detection after 4 weeks by mouse bioassay. For both mussel matrices, oocysts were prepurified using a 30% Percoll gradient and treated with sodium hypochlorite before cell culture of their sporocysts. This assay was able to detect as few as ten infective oocysts. This sporocyst-based CC-qPCR appears to be a good alternative to mouse bioassay for monitoring infectious T. gondii oocysts directly in water and also using biological sentinel mussel species. This method offers a new perspective to assess the environmental risk for human health associated with this parasite.IMPORTANCE The ubiquitous protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is the subject of renewed interest due to the spread of oocysts in water and food causing endemic and epidemic outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in humans and animals worldwide. Displaying a sensitivity close to animal models, cell culture represents a real alternative to assess the infectivity of oocysts in water and in biological sentinel mussels. This method opens interesting perspectives for evaluating human exposure to infectious T. gondii oocysts in the environment, where oocyst amounts are considered to be very small.

TI  - Ambient fine particulate matter and ozone higher than certain thresholds associated with myopia in the elderly aged 50 years and above
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although myopia has been largely ignored among the elderly population, there is an increased risk of myopia with advancing age. Ambient air pollution is one potential contributor to vision impairments, but few epidemiological studies have demonstrated such an association. This cross-sectional survey collected the information of 33,626 subjects aged >= 50 years in six developing countries during 2007-2010. Myopia was identified based on questions related to symptoms of myopia. The annual concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) were estimated with the satellite data and chemical transport model. We examined the associations between the two pollutants and myopia using mixed-effect Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation (sandwich estimation). We observed J-shaped associations between the two pollutants and myopia, and identified 12 and 54 mu g/m(3) as the threshold concentrations. The adjusted prevalence ratio was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.38) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations above their threshold, respectively. In addition, the interaction analysis suggested a synergistic interaction of these two pollutants on myopia in the additive model, with a synergistic index of 1.81 (Bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.92, 4.94). Our results indicate that long-term exposures to PM2.5 and O-3 might be important environmental risk factors of myopia in the elderly, and suggest that more efforts should be taken to reduce airborne PM2.5 and O-3 levels to protect vision health.

TI  - A Review of Protocols for Fiducial Reference Measurements of Water-Leaving Radiance for Validation of Satellite Remote-Sensing Data over Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews the state of the art of protocols for measurement of water-leaving radiance in the context of fiducial reference measurements (FRM) of water reflectance for satellite validation. Measurement of water reflectance requires the measurement of water-leaving radiance and downwelling irradiance just above water. For the former there are four generic families of method, based on: (1) underwater radiometry at fixed depths; or (2) underwater radiometry with vertical profiling; or (3) above-water radiometry with skyglint correction; or (4) on-water radiometry with skylight blocked. Each method is described generically in the FRM context with reference to the measurement equation, documented implementations and the intra-method diversity of deployment platform and practice. Ideal measurement conditions are stated, practical recommendations are provided on best practice and guidelines for estimating the measurement uncertainty are provided for each protocol-related component of the measurement uncertainty budget. The state of the art for measurement of water-leaving radiance is summarized, future perspectives are outlined, and the question of which method is best adapted to various circumstances (water type, wavelength) is discussed. This review is based on practice and papers of the aquatic optics community for the validation of water reflectance estimated from satellite data but can be relevant also for other applications such as the development or validation of algorithms for remote-sensing estimation of water constituents including chlorophyll a concentration, inherent optical properties and related products.

TI  - Glacier decline in the Central Andes (33°S): Context and magnitude from satellite and historical data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Andes (33 degrees S) represent a water-scarce region. During arid years, glacier runoff may constitute the main hydrological input at warm season and hence a steadfast deglacierization may represent a decrease in the regional water-budget. Ice-retreat enables landscape transitions from proglacial towards a paraglacial environment, allowing the formation of newly formed cryogenic deposits. Ice-surface changes in the Central Andes (33 S), including the high-mountain areas from Aconcagua, Mendoza and Maipo basins (Argentina and Chile), were studied using digitalized maps, aerial photographs, Landsat (1-8) and Sentinel-2A data for the period between 1956 and 2015. Band ratio and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) methods were tested using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A data for comparison. Geomorphological changes were assessed at Monos de Agua catchment (2750-4000 m a.s.l.) in the Aconcagua basin (Chile) as a regionally representative landscape transition case. Regional glacier shrinkage of 46 +/- 5% between 1956 and 2016 was observed for the Central Andean sub-basins in both Argentina and Chile at 33 degrees S. Overall, 107.1 +/- 5 km(2) of newly exposed surfaces are subject to permafrost conditions. Such insights raise concern in terms of current and future environmental assessments for newly formed cryospheric elements in water scarce regions.

TI  - The proportion of endometrial cancers associated with Lynch syndrome: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis
T2  - GENETICS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Endometrial cancer (EC) is often the sentinel cancer in women with Lynch syndrome (LS). However, efforts to implement universal LS screening in EC patients have been hampered by a lack of evidence detailing the proportion of EC patients that would be expected to screen positive for LS.Methods: Studies were identified by electronic searches of Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science. Proportions of test positivity were calculated by random and fixed-effects meta-analysis models. I-2 score was used to assess heterogeneity across studies.Results: Fifty-three studies, including 12,633 EC patients, met the inclusion criteria. The overall proportion of endometrial tumors with microsatellite instability or mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.28, I-2: 71%) and 0.26 (95% CI 0.25-0.27, I-2: 88%), respectively. Of those women with abnormal tumor testing, 0.29 (95% CI 0.25-0.33, I-2: 83%) had LS-associated pathogenic variants on germline testing; therefore around 3% of ECs can be attributed to LS. Preselection of EC cases did increase the proportion of germline LS diagnoses.Conclusion: The current study suggests that prevalence of LS in EC patients is approximately 3%, similar to that of colorectal cancer patients; therefore our data support the implementation of universal EC screening for LS.

TI  - Contributory factors and potentially avoidable neonatal encephalopathy associated with acute peripartum events: An observational study
T2  - AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 25% of affected babies, neonatal encephalopathy results from acute peripartum events, but rigorous review of these cases for quality improvement is seldom reported. New Zealand has maintained a national database of all babies diagnosed with Sarnat moderate and severe neonatal encephalopathy since 2010 under the Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review Committee. Aims To determine the rate of contributory factors, potentially avoidable mortality or morbidity, and to identify key areas for improvements to maternity and neonatal care among cases of neonatal encephalopathy following an acute peripartum event. Materials and methods Sarnat moderate and severe cases identified from the national collection of neonatal encephalopathy with a history of an acute peripartum event were reviewed using a standardised independent multidisciplinary methodology and a tool for assessing contributory factors and potential avoidability, with the addition of a human factors lens. Results Forty-seven cases from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. The most common acute peripartum events were placental abruption (12) and shoulder dystocia (11). Contributory factors were identified in 89%, and the severity of outcome was potentially avoidable in 66%. Key modifiable areas included dynamic risk assessment, preparedness for obstetric and neonatal emergencies, best practice for maternal and fetal surveillance in labour, and documentation. Conclusions There is significant potential to improve quality and safety in acute peripartum care to reduce the risk of neonatal encephalopathy. Human factors were not well captured by the clinical notes or review tool. Attention to human factors by improved methodology can enhance review of neonatal encephalopathy.

M3  - Article
AB  - A chasm reported on Suswa area of African rift zone during the last week of March 2018 and widely published as "Africa is splitting''. We studied the chasm and the surrounding region using differential interferometry technique to understand the ground deformation during this period. We did not observe any significant ground deformation in the interferogram at the chasm location. Interestingly, we observed a vertical deformation of 5-7.5 cm along the line of sight of the satellite along the fault located at Mosiro, Suswa region, between March 15-27 (subsidence) and March 27-April 04, 2018 (surface uplift). We present the analyses and discuss the factors that led to the surface deformation and possible association with the reported chasm in the East African rift system.

TI  - INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO STRENGTHEN THE LEARNING OF TSA'FIKI IN TSA'CHILAS EDUCATIONAL UNITS
T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The preservation of the historical memory of a native language is essential to maintain the identity of indigenous peoples and to preserve ancestral knowledge, as well as other aspects that derive in the economy such, that generates the tsa'chila culture in Santo Domingo Ecuador. However, there are few teaching tools in tsa'fiki (tsa'chila language), which makes it difficult to learn the language in the bilingual students of the tsa'chilas educational units, which causes the language to be lost, and therefore the cultural identity of this nationality. Thus, the objective of this work is to offer an alternative, for the conservation of tsa'fiki through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), observing the precepts of the tsa'chila cultural worldview, in such a way that natives can naturally assimilate the proposed technology and therefore to motivate others to learn their language. Methodologically, first an analysis of the cultural and learning aspects of the tsa'fiki that must be taken into account to implement the technological solution was made, then an evaluation of technological components was carried out to implement the solution, the prototypes were built, finally, the satisfaction of the solution was verified, inducing that ICT contribute to the learning of tsa'fiki

TI  - Evanescent-Mode Ridge-Waveguide Radiating Filters for Space Applications
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a new family of all-metallic radiators based on below-cutoff apertures fed by evanescent-mode ridge-waveguide filters. The passband of the filters and the polarization of the apertures are configured to radiate orthogonal signals at a different center frequencies. The simultaneous operation of these radiators in an array configuration results in interleaved apertures producing overlapped fields. This strategy reduces the volume and weight of the antenna system, which is an especially appealing characteristic in satellite antennas. Each isolated evanescent-mode filter ends in a small-size aperture and is designed following a novel synthesis procedure. Next, the radiating elements are combined, and the resulting array is analyzed as a multiplexer from the input ports to the free-space region, thus accounting for all mutual couplings between different apertures. To validate the theoretical formulations, a prototype has also been manufactured. The results obtained show very good agreement between simulation and measurements in terms of reflection coefficient, sidelobe level, and realized gain, thereby fully validating the new family of radiating arrays.

TI  - Land use and land cover mapping in wetlands one step closer to the ground: Sentinel-2 versus landsat 8
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental studies with Landsat images have revealed many of the problems faced by wetland ecosystem, which are crucial for the conservation of biodiversity and the natural values of our planet. The study of LULC changes in wetlands through remote sensing constantly helps to identify and combat their main environmental threats improving the conservation of these natural habitats. Starting in mid-2015, the Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities in the field of earth observation thanks to its higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolution becoming a powerful source of information for LULC monitoring in wetland areas. However, researchers may ask them selves to what extent Sentinel-2 is an improvement over Landsat 8 for general purposes. This research test if there is a real difference in the quality of the results delivered by both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery when basic classification methods are applied.The study uses Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery to produce LULC maps in a Mediterranean wetland area applying an object based classification method in order to compare the accuracy and reliability in the surface detected by both satellites. The results show that an object based classification using only the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 image information, without band indexes or ancillary data, offers very similar results for most LULC classes, being the overall accuracy around 87-88% with slightly better results when using Sentinel-2. Although using Sentinel-2 leads to an increase in file size and processing times, the analysis of certain LULC classes presents an improvement compared to Landsat 8, detecting more linear and small size elements with a better delineation of image features in the classified map. However, these improvements should not underestimate the value of Landsat imagery in the future since both satellites provide high precision information, so they can and should coexist and be used together to increase data availability in order to have the best possible results in remote sensing research.

TI  - Intra- and inter-annual variability in dynamic discharge from the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap, Severnaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic, and its role in modulating mass balance
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We determined ice velocities for the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap, Severnaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic, during November 2016-November 2017, by feature-tracking 54 pairs of Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images. Seasonal velocity variations with amplitudes up to 10% of the yearly-averaged velocity were observed. Shorter-term (<15 d) intra-annual velocity variations had average and maximum deviations from the annual mean of up to 16 and 32%, respectively. This indicates the errors that could be incurred if ice discharge values determined from a single pair of images were extrapolated to the whole year. Average ice discharge for 2016-2017 was 1.93 +/- 0.12 Gt a(-1). The difference from an estimate of similar to 1.4 Gt a(-1) for 2003-2009 was attributed to the initiation of ice stream flow in Basin BC. The total geodetic mass balance over 2012-2016 was - 1.72 +/- 0.67 Gt a(-1) (- 0.31 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1)). The climatic mass balance was not significantly different from zero, at 0.21 +/- 0.68 Gt a(-1) (0.04 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1)), and has remained near zero at decadal-scale for the last four decades. Therefore, the total mass balance has been controlled largely by variations in ice discharge, whose long-term changes do not appear to have responded to environmental changes but to the intrinsic characteristics of the ice cap governing tidewater glacier dynamics.

TI  - EFFECTS OF REPEATED SPRINTS WITH CHANGES OF DIRECTION ON YOUTH SOCCER PLAYER'S PERFORMANCE: IMPACT OF INITIAL FITNESS LEVEL
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an 8-week repeated sprint with change of direction (RS-COD) training program on RS, intermittent endurance, and change of direction performance in youth soccer players with different aerobic fitness levels. Athletes were randomly assigned into a soccer-only (n = 9; age, 14.9 +/- 0.4 years) and soccer plus RS-COD training programs for players with high (n = 10; age, 14.4 +/- 0.5 years) and low (n = 10; age, 14.4 +/- 0.5 years) aerobic fitness. Repeated sprint with change of direction was completed 2 days per week, involving 3 sets of ten 18-m sprints with 2 changes of direction of 90 degrees. The soccer-only group achieved greater improvements in intermittent endurance (effect size [ES] = 0.61) and sprint decrement during RS ability test (ES = 0.77) compared with the RS-COD groups (ES = 0.19-0.24; ES = -0.27 to 0.02; respectively). Repeated sprint with change of direction training improved RS (ES = 0.16-0.38) and change of direction (ES = 0.48) performance in high but not in low-fitness players (ES = 0.03-0.13; ES = 0.16; respectively). Moreover, improvements in RS and change of direction were (possibly) greater in high compared with low fitness and soccer-only trained players (possibly to very likely). In conclusion, although RS-COD training may positively affect RS and change of direction performance, its effects may vary according to the initial aerobic fitness of youth soccer players, with trivial effect on intermittent endurance in high-aerobic fitness players and possible beneficial effect on low-aerobic fitness players.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Heat Island Patterns in Bangkok Metropolitan Area Using Time-Series of LANDSAT Thermal Infrared Data
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangkok is a rapidly expanding city with existing natural areas being replaced by developed areas creating an urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon in the city. LANDSAT imagery, near-infrared wavelength data, and time series information were used to study and to monitor the phenomenon of surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Bangkok. The variation of land surface temperature (LST) and the urban heat island intensity (UHII) phenomenon during 2008-2014 were investigated and the relationship between the UHII phenomenon and urban sprawl in Bangkok was studied. Using the UHII, we compared nine LST images of the investigated areas defined as inner, urban fringe and suburb zones. The UHI in Bangkok in the winter (dry) is higher than in the summer. Satellite imageries were used to classify the land use types as open spaces with high-rise buildings, very high density of buildings and high-rise buildings. Low vegetation index was found in urban fringe areas and inner city area with high surface temperature. The vegetation index value is high in areas of agricultural land, and low density building, it appears in suburb areas with low surface temperature. The results indicate that NDVI and High-rise building zones influence LST distribution and UHII phenomenon.

TI  - Unmanned aerial system and satellite-based high resolution imagery for high-throughput phenotyping in dry bean
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry bean breeding programs are crucial to improve the productivity and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Phenotyping is a key process in breeding that refers to crop trait evaluation. In recent years, high-throughput plant phenotyping methods are being developed to increase the accuracy and efficiency for crop trait evaluations. In this study, aerial imagery at different resolutions were evaluated to phenotype crop performance and phenological traits using genotypes from two breeding panels, Durango Diversity Panel (DDP) and Andean Diversity Panel (ADP). The unmanned aerial system (UAS) based multispectral and thermal data were collected for two seasons at multiple time points (about 50, 60 and 75 days after planting/DAP in 2015; about 60 and 75 DAP in 2017). Four image-based features were extracted from multispectral images. Among different features, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were found to be consistently highly correlated with performance traits (above ground biomass, seed yield), especially during imaging at about 60-75 DAP (early pod development). Overall, correlations were higher using NDVI in ADP than DDP with biomass (r = -0.67 to -0.91 in ADP; r = -0.55 to -0.72 in DDP) and seed yield (r = 0.51 to 0.73 in ADP; r = 0.42 to 0.58 in DDP) at about 60 and 75 DAP. For thermal data, a temperature data normalization (utilizing common breeding plots in multiple thermal images) was implemented and the MEAN plot temperatures generally correlated significantly with biomass (r = 0.28-0.88). Finally, lower resolution satellite images (0.05-5 m/pixel) using UAS data was simulated and image resolution beyond 50 cm was found to reduce the relationship between image features (NDVI) and performance variables (biomass, seed yield). Four different high resolution satellite images: Pleiades-1A (0.5 m), SPOT 6 (1.5 m), Planet Scope (3.0 m), and Rapid Eye (5.0 m) were acquired to validate the findings from the UAS data. The results indicated sub-meter resolution satellite multispectral imagery showed promising application in field phenotyping, especially when the genotypic responses to stress is prominent. The correlation between NDVI extracted from Pleiades-1A images with seed yield (r = 0.52) and biomass (r = -0.55) were stronger in ADP; where the strength in relationship reduced with decreasing satellite image resolution. In future, we anticipate higher spatial and temporal resolution data achieved with low-orbiting satellites will increase applications for high-throughput crop phenotyping,

AB  - Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) calculated by six different institutions (Brazil Center for Weather Prediction and Climate Studies/CPTEC/INPE, European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites/EUMETSAT, Japan Meteorological Agency/JMA, Korea Meteorological Administration/KMA, Unites States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NOAA, and the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Nowcasting and Very short range forecasting/NWCSAF) with JMA's Himawari-8 satellite data and other common input data are here compared. The comparison is based on two different AMV input datasets, calculated with two different image triplets for 21 July 2016, and the use of a prescribed and a specific configuration. The main results of the study are summarized as follows: (1) the differences in the AMV datasets depend very much on the 'AMV height assignment' used and much less on the use of a prescribed or specific configuration; (2) the use of the 'Common Quality Indicator (CQI)' has a quantified skill in filtering collocated AMVs for an improved statistical agreement between centers; (3) Among the six AMV operational algorithms verified by this AMV Intercomparison, JMA AMV algorithm has the best overall performance considering all validation metrics, mainly due to its new height assignment method: 'Optimal estimation method considering the observed infrared radiances, the vertical profile of the Numerical Weather Prediction wind, and the estimated brightness temperature using a radiative transfer model'.

TI  - Quantifying stochastic uncertainty in detection time of human-caused climate signals
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Large initial condition ensembles of a climate model simulation provide many different realizations of internal variability noise superimposed on an externally forced signal. They have been used to estimate signal emergence time at individual grid points, but are rarely employed to identify global fingerprints of human influence. Here we analyze 50- and 40-member ensembles performed with 2 climate models; each was run with combined human and natural forcings. We apply a pattern-based method to determine signal detection time t(d) in individual ensemble members. Distributions of t(d) are characterized by the median t(d){m} and range t(d){r}, computed for tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures over 1979 to 2018. Lower stratospheric cooling-primarily caused by ozone depletion-yields t(d){m} values between 1994 and 1996, depending on model ensemble, domain (global or hemispheric), and type of noise data. For greenhouse-gas-driven tropospheric warming, larger noise and slower recovery from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption lead to later signal detection (between 1997 and 2003). The stochastic uncertainty t(d){r} is greater for tropospheric warming (8 to 15 y) than for stratospheric cooling (1 to 3 y). In the ensemble generated by a high climate sensitivity model with low anthropogenic aerosol forcing, simulated tropospheric warming is larger than observed; detection times for tropospheric warming signals in satellite data are within t(d){r} ranges in 60% of all cases. The corresponding number is 88% for the second ensemble, which was produced by a model with even higher climate sensitivity but with large aerosolinduced cooling. Whether the latter result is physically plausible will require concerted efforts to reduce significant uncertainties in aerosol forcing.

TI  - Combining Machine Learning and Compact Polarimetry for Estimating Soil Moisture from C-Band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed at exploiting the joint use of machine learning and polarimetry for improving the retrieval of surface soil moisture content (SMC) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions at C-band. The study was conducted on two agricultural areas in Canada, for which a series of RADARSAT-2 (RS2) images were available along with direct measurements of SMC from in situ stations. The analysis confirmed the sensitivity of RS2 backscattering (sigma degrees) to SMC. The comparison of SMC with the compact polarimetry (CP) parameters, computed from the RS2 acquisitions by the CP data simulator, pointed out that some CP parameters had a sensitivity to SMC equal or better than sigma degrees, with correlation coefficients up to R similar or equal to 0.4. Based on these results, the potential of machine learning (ML) for SMC retrieval was exploited by implementing and testing on the available data an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The algorithm was implemented using several combinations of sigma degrees and CP parameters. Validation results of the algorithm with in situ observations confirmed the promising capabilities of the ML techniques for SMC monitoring. Furthermore, results pointed out the potential of CP in improving the SMC retrieval accuracy, especially when used in combination with linearly polarized sigma degrees. Depending on the considered input combination, the ANN algorithm was able to estimate SMC with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between 3% and 7% of SMC and R between 0.7 and 0.9.

TI  - Applying the remotely sensed data to identify homogeneous regions of watersheds using a pixel-based classification approach
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of homogeneous areas within watersheds can help managers and decision makers to administer watershed policies and sustainable environmental management. These homogeneous areas do not follow the boundaries of sub-watersheds. This study presents a pixel-based classification approach to demarcate more realistic homogeneous areas within watersheds with greater details, instead of classification using average watershed attributes. Remotely sensed indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), and information on land use, elevation, slope, aspect, relative slope position (RSP), and topographic wetness index (TWI), were derived from MODIS, Landsat, and Terra/ASTER and employed to identify homogeneous areas in the Karkheh Watershed, west of Iran. The association among variables was tested for multicollinearity, then fuzzy c-mean clustering approach was used to classify pixels. Two validation criteria of Xie-Beni (XB) and Fukuyama-Sugeno (FS) were applied to determine the best number of classes. Results of the fuzzy clustering indicated that the optimum number of homogeneous areas was equal to four (XB = 4E-06, and FS = -7232). The homogeneous areas identified in this study need different management and protection policies, which can help managers with sustainable environmental management.

TI  - Flood Mapping with Convolutional Neural Networks Using Spatio-Contextual Pixel Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology in recent years has been regarded the most important source to provide substantial information for delineating the flooding extent to the disaster management authority. There have been numerous studies proposing mathematical or statistical classification models for flood mapping. However, conventional pixel-wise classifications methods rely on the exact match of the spectral signature to label the target pixel. In this study, we propose a fully convolutional neural networks (F-CNNs) classification model to map the flooding extent from Landsat satellite images. We utilised the spatial information from the neighbouring area of target pixel in classification. A total of 64 different models were generated and trained with a variable neighbourhood size of training samples and number of learnable filters. The training results revealed that the model trained with <mml:semantics>3x3</mml:semantics> neighbourhood sized training samples and with 32 convolutional filters achieved the best performance out of the experiments. A new set of different Landsat images covering flooded areas across Australia were used to evaluate the classification performance of the model. A comparison of our proposed classification model to the conventional support vector machines (SVM) classification model shows that the F-CNNs model was able to detect flooded areas more efficiently than the SVM classification model. For example, the F-CNNs model achieved a maximum precision rate (true positives) of 76.7% compared to 45.27% for SVM classification.

TI  - Linkage of aerosol optical depth with rainfall and circulation parameters over the Eastern Gangetic Plains of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important physical parameter and dimensionless number. The possible link between AOD and variability of summer monsoon rainfall and surface temperature over the densely populated Gangetic Plain may be used to assess change in weather and climate over the Plain. For examining the impact of AOD on summer monsoon rainfall and surface temperature, monthly data of AOD for the period of 2000-2015 are obtained from a remotely sensed moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer sensor at 550 nm and at a surface resolution of 1 degrees x1 degrees. For the period of 2000-2015, rainfall and surface temperature data at a resolution of 1 degrees x1 degrees are obtained from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and surface wind data are obtained from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Summer monsoon rainfall and AOD are inversely related during 2000-2015. On an average, a difference in the mean monthly surface maximum and minimum temperatures increases (decreases) with a decrease (increase) of AOD. The high degree of correlation exists between AOD and a difference in Tmax and Tmin during January to June-July. In winter months, relative strength of negative vorticity over the Gangetic Plain and positive vorticity in the adjacent area may be cause of more dispersion of AOD in February in comparison with that in December and January and therefore more AOD is noticed in January and December.

TI  - An Ocean-Colour Time Series for Use in Climate Studies: The Experience of the Ocean-Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean colour is recognised as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS); and spectrally-resolved water-leaving radiances (or remote-sensing reflectances) in the visible domain, and chlorophyll-a concentration are identified as required ECV products. Time series of the products at the global scale and at high spatial resolution, derived from ocean-colour data, are key to studying the dynamics of phytoplankton at seasonal and inter-annual scales; their role in marine biogeochemistry; the global carbon cycle; the modulation of how phytoplankton distribute solar-induced heat in the upper layers of the ocean; and the response of the marine ecosystem to climate variability and change. However, generating a long time series of these products from ocean-colour data is not a trivial task: algorithms that are best suited for climate studies have to be selected from a number that are available for atmospheric correction of the satellite signal and for retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration; since satellites have a finite life span, data from multiple sensors have to be merged to create a single time series, and any uncorrected inter-sensor biases could introduce artefacts in the series, e.g., different sensors monitor radiances at different wavebands such that producing a consistent time series of reflectances is not straightforward. Another requirement is that the products have to be validated against in situ observations. Furthermore, the uncertainties in the products have to be quantified, ideally on a pixel-by-pixel basis, to facilitate applications and interpretations that are consistent with the quality of the data. This paper outlines an approach that was adopted for generating an ocean-colour time series for climate studies, using data from the MERIS (MEdium spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor of the European Space Agency; the SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor) and MODIS-Aqua (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua) sensors from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (USA); and VIIRS (Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USA). The time series now covers the period from late 1997 to end of 2018. To ensure that the products meet, as well as possible, the requirements of the user community, marine-ecosystem modellers, and remote-sensing scientists were consulted at the outset on their immediate and longer-term requirements as well as on their expectations of ocean-colour data for use in climate research. Taking the user requirements into account, a series of objective criteria were established, against which available algorithms for processing ocean-colour data were evaluated and ranked. The algorithms that performed best with respect to the climate user requirements were selected to process data from the satellite sensors. Remote-sensing reflectance data from MODIS-Aqua, MERIS, and VIIRS were band-shifted to match the wavebands of SeaWiFS. Overlapping data were used to correct for mean biases between sensors at every pixel. The remote-sensing reflectance data derived from the sensors were merged, and the selected in-water algorithm was applied to the merged data to generate maps of chlorophyll concentration, inherent optical properties at SeaWiFS wavelengths, and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. The merged products were validated against in situ observations.The uncertainties established on the basis of comparisons with in situ data were combined with an optical classification of the remote-sensing reflectance data using a fuzzy-logic approach, and were used to generate uncertainties (root mean square difference and bias) for each product at each pixel.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy following previous axillary surgery in recurrent breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Ipsilateral breast recurrence or second primary breast cancer can develop in patients who have undergone breast conserving surgery (BCS) and axillary surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of a reoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as a repeated axillary staging procedure.Patients and methods: From August 2014 through January 2017 patients with locally recurrent breast cancer or with BRCA mutation requiring risk reduction mastectomy as a second surgical procedure, underwent repeat SLNB in three Hungarian Breast Units with a radiocolloid (and blue dye) technique.Results: Hundred and sixty repeat SLNBs were analysed, 80 after previous SLNB and 80 after previous total or partial axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). SLN identification was successful in 106 patients (66%); 77/80 (77.5%) and 44/80 (55%) in the SLNB and ALND groups, respectively. (p < 0.003). Extra-axillary lymph drainage was more frequent in the ALND group (19/44, 43,2% versus 7/62, 11,3%; p < 0.001). Lymphatic drainage to the contralateral axilla was observed in 14 patients (11 in the ALND group, p = 0.025), isolated parasternal drainage was detected in 4 patients (p = 0.31). Only 9/106 patients with successful repeat SLNB (8,8%, all with 1 SLN removed) had SLN metastasesConclusions: Repeat SLNB is feasible in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or new ipsilateral primary tumor after previous BCS and axillary staging. Repeat SLNB should replace routine ALND as the standard axillary restaging procedure in recurrent disease with a clinically negative axilla. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is important to explore extra-axillary lymphatic drainage in this restaging setting. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The association of major life events with chronic fatigue
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Major life events have been associated with the onset of unexplained chronic fatigue (CF) and with variability in illness course. The purpose of this study was to characterize the associations of major life events with illness status over time.Method. Sentinel measures of clinical status were collected four times over 18 months in a cohort of 99 persons with CF; participants also were interviewed regarding major life events, which were independently rated by observers.Results: Over time, more major life events attributed to CF predicted a worse clinical course, suggesting that illness-related major life events rather than stressful life events in general are associated with worse clinical status for persons with CF.Conclusion: This study adds to the literature regarding specific types of life events' relationship to illness course, which has implications for the management of CF.

TI  - Prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia and nasal colonization in a free-ranging koala population
T2  - MEDICAL MYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryptococcosis, caused by environmental fungi in the Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species complexes, affects a variety of hosts, including koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). Cryptococcal antigenemia and nasal colonization are well characterized in captive koalas, but free-ranging populations have not been studied systematically. Free-ranging koalas (181) from the Liverpool Plains region of New South Wales, Australia, were tested for cryptococcal antigenemia (lateral flow immunoassay) and nasal colonization (bird seed agar culture). Results were related to environmental and individual koala characteristics. Eucalypt trees (14) were also randomly tested for the presence of Cryptococcus spp. by bird seed agar culture. In sum, 5.5% (10/181) and 6.6% (12/181) of koalas were positive for antigenemia and nasal colonization, respectively, on at least one occasion. And 64.3% (9/14) of eucalypts were culture-positive for Cryptococcus spp. URA5 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis identified most isolates as C. gattii VGI, while C. neoformans VNI was only found in one koala and one tree. Colonized koalas were significantly more likely to test positive for antigenemia. No associations between antigenemia or colonization, and external environmental characteristics (the relative abundance of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and season), or individual koala characteristics (body condition, sex, and age), could be established, suggesting that antigenemia and colonization are random outcomes of host-pathogen-environment interactions. The relationship between positive antigenemia status and a relatively high abundance of E. camaldulensis requires further investigation. This study characterizes cryptococcosis in a free-ranging koala population, expands the ecological niche of the C. gattii/C. neoformans species complexes and highlights free-ranging koalas as important sentinels for this disease.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This is an official guideline, published and coordinated by the Gynecological Oncology Working Group (AGO) of the German Cancer Society (DKG) and the German Society for Gynecology and Obstetrics (DGGG). Vaginal cancers are rare tumors, which is why there is very little evidence on these tumors. Knowledge about the optimal clinical management is limited. This first German S2k guideline on vaginal cancer has aimed to compile the most current expert knowledge and offer new recommendations on the appropriate treatment as well as providing pointers about individually adapted therapies with lower morbidity rates than were previously generally available. The purpose of this guideline is also to set up a register to record data on treatment data and the course of disease as a means of obtaining evidence in future.Methods The present S2k guideline was developed by members of the Vulvar und Vaginal Tumors Commission of the AGO in an independently moderated, structured, formal consensus process and the contents were agreed with the mandate holders of the participating scientific societies and organizations.Recommendations To optimize the daily care of patients with vaginal cancer: 1. Monitor the spread pattern; 2. Follow the step-by-step diagnostic workup based on initial stage at detection; 3. As part of individualized clinical therapeutic management of vaginal cancer, follow the sentinel lymph node protocol described here, where possible; 4. Participate in the register study on vaginal cancer.

TI  - The Annual Cycle of Fractional Atmospheric Shortwave Absorption in Observations and Models: Spatial Structure, Magnitude, and Timing
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the best currently available in situ and satellite-derived surface and top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiation observations to explore climatological annual cycles of fractional (i.e., normalized by incoming radiation at the TOA) atmospheric shortwave absorption a similar to on a global scale. The analysis reveals that a similar to is a rather regional feature where the reported nonexisting a similar to in Europe is an exception rather than the rule. In several regions, large and distinctively different a similar to are apparent. The magnitudes of a similar to reach values up to 10% in some regions, which is substantial given that the long-term global mean atmospheric shortwave absorption is roughly 23%. Water vapor and aerosols are identified as major drivers for a similar to while clouds seem to play only a minor role for a similar to. Regions with large annual cycles in aerosol emissions from biomass burning also show the largest a similar to. As biomass burning is generally related to human activities, a similar to is likely also anthropogenically intensified or forced in the respective regions. We also test if climate models are able to simulate the observed pattern of a similar to. In regions where a similar to is driven by the annual cycle of natural aerosols or water vapor, the models perform well. In regions with large a similar to induced by biomass-burning aerosols, the models' performance is very limited.

TI  - UoNGBR: A Regional Assimilation Barotropic Tidal Model for the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea Based on Satellite, Coastal and Marine Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - All available satellite altimetry, coastal and marine data have been used to develop a new assimilative barotropic tidal model over the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and Coral Sea using the Oregon State University Tidal Inverse Software (OTIS) with the specific consideration of bathymetry and drag coefficients. The model, named the University of Newcastle Great Barrier Reef (UoNGBR), has a 2 ' x 2 ' spatial resolution and includes 37 major and shallow water tidal constituents. The key to the development of UoNGBR is the use of a high-resolution bathymetry model gbr100 (3.6 '' x 3.6 '', corresponding to 100 meters resolution) and a recent baroclinic GBR1 hydrodynamic model. The gbr100 provides more detailed and accurate bottom topography, while the GBR1 hydrodynamic model provides spatially variable drag coefficients. These are particularly important in our study area due to the existence of numerous islands, coral reefs and complex bottom topography. The UoNGBR and seven existing tidal models have been used to detide independent datasets from the coastal tide gauges and Sentinel-3A altimeter mission. The detided datasets are then compared to the UoNGBR-detided data. The results show that UoNGBR has the minimum root sum square value (25.1 cm) when compared to those (between 26.1 and 66.7 cm) from seven other models, indicating that UoNGBR is among the best models in predicting tidal heights in the GBR and Coral Sea. Over coastline and coastal zones, the UoNGBR's mean RMS errors are 18 and 5 cm, respectively, smaller than TPXO models, as well as about 1-5 cm smaller than FES2012 and FES2014. These suggest that the UoNGBR model is a major improvement over other models in coastline and coastal zones.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of multi-scale watersheds impermeability for urban hydrological evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surface coverage is an important parameter to understand effects of hydro-environment on the process of urbanization. Impervious surfaces have altered urban hydrological process, spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and water environment quality and led to increasing frequency and intensity of urban waterlogging. In view of the impact of the increase of impervious surface on urban hydrological environment, there are two problems in current research and application: (1) urban hydrological modeling and impermeability ratio are computed according to multi-level administrative units rather than watersheds; (2) the entire urban hydrological environment is an organic whole, but the urban watersheds system within a city have not been monitored dynamically by considering adjacent watersheds. In view of these two problems, the main innovative points in this research work include (1) first, urban multi-scale watersheds are defined, and impermeability ratios are calculated at multi-scale watersheds level for urban hydrological modeling. (2) Based on urban DEM analysis, considering the interconnection of multiple urban water systems by calculating the dynamic impermeability ratios, the dynamic impact of urban rainfall and runoff changes on the whole urban hydrological environment is monitored. The results show overall impervious surface ratio of each watershed is proportional to the runoff. The ratio of the impervious surface reaches 20%, and the discharge is more than twice that when impervious ratio is 4%. It can be concluded that at watershed level a higher the degree of urbanization can lead to a larger change in the total run off, and the earlier shift of the peak flow.

TI  - A semi-analytical approach for remote sensing of trophic state in inland waters: Bio-optical mechanism and application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic state index (TSI) is a vital parameter for aquatic ecosystem assessment. Thus, information on the spatial and temporal distribution of TSI is critical for supporting scientifically sound water resource management decisions. We proposed a semi-analytical approach to remotely estimate TSI based on Landsat 8 OLI data for inland waters. The approach has two major steps: deriving the total absorption coefficient of optically active constituents (OACs) and building the relationship between the total absorption coefficient and TSI. First, version 6.0 of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA_V6, developed by Zhongping Lee) was implemented with Landsat 8 OLI data to derive the total absorption coefficients of the 'OACs. Second, we modeled TSI using the total absorption coefficients of OACs at 440 nm based on a large in situ measurement dataset. The total absorption coefficient of OACs at 440 nm gave satisfactory validation results for modeling TSI with a mean absolute percent error of 6% and a root-mean-square error of 5.77. Then, we performed this approach in three inland waters with various eutrophic statuses to validate its results, and the approach demonstrated a robust and satisfactory performance. Finally, an application of the approach was demonstrated in Lake Qiandaohu. Our semi-analytical approach has a sound optical mechanism and extensive application for different trophic inland waters.

T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Taking the Xiushui township of Baisha county in Hainan province as the research area,the random forest algorithm with obvious advantages in feature selection and classification extraction was used to extract the information of the Callicarpa nudiflora planting in the study area. Firstly,four kinds of different characteristic variables were generated based on World View-3 data,including spectral features,principal component features,vegetation index and texture features. Secondly,the spatial distribution of the C. nudiflora in the study area was extracted by remote sensing by random forest classification algorithm. Finally,the feature space of the random forest classification algorithm was optimized based on the feature importance to obtain the best random forest classification results,and this result is compared with the classification result of the random forest algorithm of the unoptimized feature space. The results showed that:①The overall accuracy of the C. nudiflora extracted by World View-3 image was 89. 97%,and the Kappa coefficient was 0. 84,which indicates that the random forest algorithm had higher classification accuracy and better applicability in Hainan C. nudiflora recognition.② The overall accuracy of extracting C. nudiflora with the dimension reduction feature was 90. 4,and the Kappa coefficient was 0. 85,which indicates that the random forest algorithm can effectively select features. At the same time as the feature variable data mining,the precision of the information extraction of the C. nudiflora was still guaranteed,and the operation efficiency was improved. This study provides a new idea,method and technical means for information extraction of cultivated medicinal plant resources in terms of feature selection and method selection.

TI  - Derivation of Tasseled Cap Transformation Coefficients for Sentinel-2 MSI At-Sensor Reflectance Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tasseled cap transformation (TCT) is a commonly used remote-sensing technique and has been successfully used in various remote sensing-related applications. However, the TCT coefficient set is sensor-specific, and therefore, in this article, we developed the TCT coefficients specifically for Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument at-sensor reflectance data. A total of ten synchronous image pairs of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, collected from the different parts of the world, were used for this approach. Instead of using the traditional Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) method, we derived the coefficients using a principal component-based Procrustes analysis (PCP) method. This was done by rotating principal component axes of Sentinel-2 data to align to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager tasseled cap axes via the Procrustes analysis. The results show that the TCT coefficients derived from our PCP method can effectively enhance brightness, greenness, and wetness characteristics of the Sentinel-2 imagery. The results have also been compared with those of a previous study that derived the Sentinel-2 TCT data using the GSO method instead. Landsat-8 and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived TCT data have been used as references for comparison. The comparison shows that the PCP method outperforms the GSO method, as the PCP's results generally have lower root mean square errors and higher correlation coefficients (R) when compared with the corresponding TC components of Landsat-8 and MODIS data, respectively. The greatest difference between the PCP and GSO methods lies in the wetness component. The PCP method can correctly highlight vegetation and soil moisture, as well as water features in the component.

TI  - REAL-TIME VISUALIZATION OF LYMPHATIC FLOW TO SENTINEL LYMPH NODES BY CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASONOGRAPHY WITH SONAZOID IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with Sonazoid (SNZ) enables real-time visualization, resulting in more precise identification of lymphatic flow to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). This study aimed to classify lymphatic drainage patterns to SLNs. Patients (n = 75) with T1-2 N0 M0 breast cancer received a periareolar injection of SNZ to identify SNZ-enhanced SLNs (SNZ-SLNs), followed by SLN biopsy with blue dye. The lymphatic drainage patterns were classified into four types: type A, single lymphatic route/single SLN; type B, multiple lymphatic routes/single SLN; type C, single lymphatic route/multiple SLNs; and type D, multiple lymphatic routes/ multiple SLNs. SLNs were successfully identified in all patients using both blue dye and SNZ. The drainage lymphatic pathways identified were as follows: type A in 53 cases (70.7%), type B in seven (9.3%), type C in eight cases (10.7%) and type D in seven (9.3%). SNZ-SLN biopsy is a technically simple method with a 100% identification rate, enabling the real-time visualization of lymphatic flow to SNZ-SLNs.

TI  - A Synergetic Analysis of Sentinel-1 and-2 for Mapping Historical Landslides Using Object-Oriented Random Forest in the Hyrcanian Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing efforts in the mapping of landslides using Sentinel-1 and -2, research on their combination for discerning historical landslides in forest areas is still lacking, particularly using object-oriented machine learning approaches. This study was accomplished to test the efficiency of Sentinel-derived features and digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives for mapping old and new landslides, using object-oriented random forest. Two forest subsets were selected including a protected and non-protected forest in northeast Iran. Landslide samples were obtained from CORONA images and aerial photos (old landslides), and also field mensuration and high-resolution images (new landslides). Segment objects were generated from a set combination of Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-2A, and some topographic-derived indices using multiresolution segmentation algorithm. Various object features were derived from the main channels of Sentinel images and DEM derivatives in the seven main groups, including spectral layers, spectral indices, geometric, contextual, textural, topographic, and hydrologic features. A single database was created, including landslide samples and Sentinel- and DEM-derived object features. Roughly 20% of landslide-affected objects and non-landslide-affected objects were randomly selected as an input for training the random forest classifier. Two-thirds of the selected objects were assigned as learning samples for classification, and the remainder were used for testing the accuracy of landslide and non-landslide classification. Results indicated that: (1) The sensitivity of mapping historical landslides was 86.6% and 80.3% in the protected and non-protected forests, respectively; (2) the object features of Sentinel-2A and DEM obtained the highest importance with the total scores of 55.6% and 32%, respectively in the protected forests, and 65.4% and 21% respectively in the non-protected forests; (3) the features derived from the combination of Sentinel-1 and -2A demonstrated a total importance of 10% for mapping new landslides; and (4) textural features were obtained in approximately two-thirds of the total scores for mapping new landslides, however a combination of topographic, spectral, textural, and contextual features were the effective predictors for mapping old landslides. This research proposes applying a synergetic analysis of Sentinel- and DEM-derived features for mapping historical landslides; however, there are no uniformly pre-defined influential variables for mapping historical landslides in different forest areas.

TI  - Repeat-pass SAR interferometry for land cover classification: A methodology using Sentinel-1 Short-Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we explore the potential of repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR) for land cover classification purposes. We introduce a novel approach for the generation of large-scale thematic maps, based on the use of multi-temporal data, acquired over short observation intervals (short-time-series). A larger interferometric coherence loss is expected with the increasing time difference between two interferometric acquisitions. This phenomenon is normally indicated as temporal decorrelation whose amount differs depending on the type of imaged target on ground. The basic idea is therefore to accurately model the evolution in time of the temporal decorrelation and use the estimated parameters, together with backscatter, as input features for the Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. The work has been carried out on the case study of land cover mapping over central Europe, considering Sentinel-1 C-band interferometric stacks, acquired over a time span of about one month. Three different land cover classes have been considered: artificial surfaces as e.g. urban areas, forests, and non-forested areas as the ensemble of low vegetation, bare soil, and agricultural areas. The results show a level of agreement above 91%, when compared to the CORINE land cover map product of 2012, which has been used as external reference for both training and testing of the classification algorithm.

TI  - Habitat amount, quality, and fragmentation associated with prevalence of the tick-borne pathogen <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</i> and occupancy dynamics of its vector, <i>Amblyomma americanum</i>
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Tick-borne diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent world-wide. This is likely due in part to land-cover change, particularly forest fragmentation, but this evidence is largely limited to Lyme disease. It is unknown whether this is generalizable to other, emergent tick-borne pathogens. Objectives Motivated by hypotheses regarding landscape context and vertebrate hosts, we asked how landscape context, namely habitat amount, quality, and fragmentation, is related to the distribution of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a tick-borne pathogen of increasing concern, and the interannual occupancy dynamics of its vector, the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). Methods We collected nymphal ticks from 130 plots in southeastern Virginia, U.S., for 5 years and tested for E. chaffeensis via targeted PCR. We derived metrics of landscape context from Landsat data and related these to pathogen prevalence and tick turnover using hierarchical Bayesian models. Results Landscape context was associated with both pathogen prevalence and tick turnover. Pathogen prevalence was negatively associated with total forest landcover, coniferous forest landcover, and forest edge density. Tick turnover was positively associated with coniferous landcover and with an interaction between total forest landcover and edge. This interaction was such that turnover was predicted to be lowest in small contiguous forests, and highest in small fragmented forests. Conclusions Landscape context affects E. chaffeensis prevalence and occupancy dynamics of its tick host, though these processes appear decoupled. We hypothesize that pathogen prevalence may be more driven by reservoir host movement and social behavior and tick dynamics are more driven by host population density.

TI  - Reproducibility assessment and uncertainty quantification in subjective dust source mapping
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate dust-source characterizations are critical for effectively modeling dust storms. A previous study developed an approach to manually map dust plume-head point sources in a geographic information system (GIS) framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery processed through dust-enhancement algorithms. With this technique, the location of a dust source is digitized and recorded if an analyst observes an unobscured plume head in the imagery. Because airborne dust must be sufficiently elevated for overland dust-enhancement algorithms to work, this technique may include up to 10km in digitized dust-source location error due to downwind advection. However, the potential for en-or in this method due to analyst subjectivity has never been formally quantified. In this study, we evaluate a version of the methodology adapted to better enable reproducibility assessments amongst multiple analysts to determine the role of analyst subjectivity on recorded dust source location error. Four analysts individually mapped dust plumes in Southwest Asia and Northwest Africa using five years of MODIS imagery collected from 15 May to 31 August. A plume-source location is considered reproducible if the maximum distance between the analyst point source markers for a single plume is <= 10 km. Results suggest analyst marker placement is reproducible; however, additional analyst subjectivity-induced error (7 km determined in this study) should be considered to fully characterize locational uncertainty. Additionally, most of the identified plume heads (> 90%) were not marked by all participating analysts, which indicates dust source maps generated using this technique may differ substantially between users.

TI  - Monitoring sugarcane growth response to varying nitrogen application rates: A comparison of UAV SLAM LiDAR and photogrammetry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The capabilities and utility of UAV LiDAR and surface from motion photogrammetry have been of wide discussion in the remote sensing community and assumptions made, often speculative, about the potential strengths and limitations of these systems. Here, we employ a side-by-side test of the CSIRO Hovermap LiDAR and Micasense RedEdge multispectral camera simultaneously mounted to a single UAV platform to acquire a time-series data set from both sensors over the growth cycle of a sugarcane crop in northeast Queensland, Australia. The primary aim was to compare the ability of each system to accurately measure crop height, over a single growing cycle. A secondary aim examined the correlation between these measures and the sugarcane biophysical parameters of stalk population (stalks.m(-2)), total fresh biomass (TFB, t.ha(-1)) and cane yield (Yield, t cane.ha(-1)). The experimental design included a randomised complete block design of four nitrogen fertiliser treatments (0, 70, 110, 150 and 190 Nkg.ha(-1)) with four replications to assess if either optical measure could detect significant effects of nitrogen application on crop growth. Both systems demonstrated similar capabilities for accurately measuring crop heights throughout the growth period with statistically significant coefficients of determination observed when comparing the maximum (R-Adj(2) = .885, F(1,118) = 910.806, p <= .001) and mean (R-Adj(2) = .929, F(1,118) = 1548.404, p <= .001) crop height estimations of both instruments. In addition, both systems responded similarly in the detection of differences in crop structural properties response to nitrogen treatments. Only Hovermap, however, demonstrated the capacity to obtain sufficient ground returns over the course of the growth period to enable comparisons to the biophysical samples using a ground-to-non-ground return ratio (Stalk Population: R-Adj(2) = .788, F(1,18) = 70.688, p <= .001, TFB: R-Adj(2) = .713, F(1,18) = 48.198, p <= .001, Yield: R-Adj(2) = .707, F(1,18) = 46.921, p <= .001) with the best results of RedEdge obtained when comparing mean height measures (Stalk Population R-Adj(2) = .502, F(1,18) = 20.172, p <= .001, TFB: R-Adj(2) = .309, F(1,18) = 9.481, p = 0.006, Yield: R-Adj(2) = .322, F(1,18) = 10.028, p <= .005). The results suggest that although both systems are comparable for accurate crop height measurements, and as such, provide early detection of potential problems, UAV LiDAR provided more consistent and significant correlations with optical remotely sensed data to the biophysical parameters of sugarcane.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative uses temporally dense Landsat data and time series analyses to characterize landscape change in the United States from 1985 to present. LCMAP will be used to explain how past, present, and future landscape change affects society and natural systems. Here, we describe a modeling framework for producing high-resolution (spatial and thematic) landscape projections at a national scale, using a unique parcel-based modeling framework. The methodology was tested by modeling 11 land use scenarios and 3 climate realizations for the U.S. Great Plains. Results demonstrate 1) an ability to balance competing land-use demands from quite variable, complex scenarios, 2) urban growth that matches theoretical future patterns, 3) the value of remote sensing data sources for model parameterization and for deriving landscape parcels, and 4) a pragmatic approach that facilitates the development of high thematic- and spatial-resolution projections at a national scale.

TI  - The sources of academic localism and globalism in Russian sociology: The choice of professional ideologies and occupational niches among social scientists
T2  - CURRENT SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Why do social scientists choose certain theoretical and methodological stances over others? Three broad explanatory models can be derived from the literature on the sociology of social sciences: (1) worldview, arguing that intellectual preferences reflect general cultural and political orientations of broad social groupings to which an individual belongs; (2) status, according to which all forms of hierarchies are reproduced in the academic field through preferences for innovative research by those occupying dominant positions and their avoidance by agents lacking resources; (3) ecological, holding that opportunity structures existing at the historical moment at which an individual enters the academic field determine the theory choice. This article analyses the adoption of globalist or localist professional ideologies, favouring an international career and global recognition over a domestic one, or vice versa, to explore the biographical antecedents of choosing one side over the other in an important disciplinary divide. In doing so, the study draws on statistical data from a community study of sociology in Leningrad/St Petersburg between 1984 and 2011. The worldview hypothesis finds the strongest support: the preference for national or international scholarship reflects more general liberal or conservative attitudes characteristic of certain milieus existing in Russian society.

AB  - This study attempted to simulate the flood discharge in the Duman River basin containing Hoeryong City and Musan County of North Korea where were damaged from Typhoon Lionrock on August, 2016. For hydrological modelling remotely sensed datasets were used to estimate watershed properties and hydrologic factors because the basin is ungauged where hydrological observation is not exist or sparse. For validation we applied our methodology and datasets to the Soyanggang Dam basin. It has not only similar shape factor and compactness ratio to those of the target basin but also accurate, adequate, and abundant measurements. The results showed that the flood discharge from Typhoon Lionrock corresponded to three to five years design floods in the Duman River basin. This indicate that the Duman River basin has a high risk of flood in the near future. Finally this study demonstrated that remotely sensed data and geographic information could be utilized to simulate flood discharge in an ungauged watershed.

In particular, the Gurvansayhan and Mandalovoo island arc terranes, have high potential for ore deposits. Regional mineral mapping of these terranes using data from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) have provided new geological information on the metallogenic province, revealing potential mineral deposits for future explorations. Iron oxides/hydroxides with high ETM (+) band 1/3 ratio values occur extensively in Quaternary deposits located at the boundary between the Gurvansayhan and Mandalovoo island arcs terranes and basins. The high average band ratios ( > 1.35) registered for the porphyry Cu and Au deposits and their occurrences are associated with iron oxidation which originates from the erosion and weathering of ore zones. Regional mapping of the island arc terranes using the ASTER shortwave infrared (SWIR) logical operators showed circular or semicircular alteration patterns which usually cluster along faults. The mineral assemblages mapped by the ASTER SWIR analysis in five major porphyry Cu districts can be divided into two types. The first type includes argillic, phyllic, and propylitic mineral assemblages, as exemplified by the Shuteen, Ikh Shankhai, and Oyu Tolgoi deposits. The second type of assemblage includes phyllic and propylitic mineral assemblages, as exemplified by the Kharmagtai and Tsagaan Suvarga deposits. Within the deposits of the first type, quartz was also mapped using the ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) mineral index. The difference between the two types may be related to the presence of a lithocap. The results of a field survey including spectral reflectance measurements in the Ikh Shankhai porphyry Cu district, showed a good correlation with the image analysis results.

TI  - Monitoring finer-scale population density in urban functional zones: A remote sensing data fusion approach
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution information on population density is essential for understanding urban dynamics. In recent decades, remote sensing techniques have often been applied to assess population density, particularly night-time light data (NTL). However, such attempts have resulted in mapped population density at coarse/medium resolution, which often limits the applicability of such data for fine-scale territorial planning. The improved quality and availability of multi-source remote sensing imagery and location-based service data (LBS) (from mobile networks or social media) offers new potential for providing more accurate population information at the micro-scale level. In this paper, we developed a fine-scale population distribution mapping approach by combining the functional zones (FZ) mapped with high-resolution satellite images, NTL data, and LBS data. Considering the possible variations in the relationship between population distribution and nightlight brightness in functional zones, we tested and found spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between NTL and the population density of LBS samples. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was thus implemented to test potential improvements to the mapping accuracy. The performance of the following four models was evaluated: only ordinary least squares regression (OLS), only GWR, OLS with functional zones (OLS&FZ) and GWR with functional zones (GWR&FZ). The results showed that NTL-based GWR&FZ was the most accurate and robust approach, with an accuracy of 0.71, while the mapped population density was at a unit of 30 m spatial resolution. The detailed population density maps developed in our approach can contribute to fine-scale urban planning, healthcare and emergency responses in many parts of the world.

TI  - An Improved Soil Moisture Retrieval Algorithm Based on the Land Parameter Retrieval Model for Water-Land Mixed Pixels Using AMSR-E Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) has been widely used for the retrieval of microwave-based global surface soil moisture (SSM). In the original LPRM algorithm, soil surface effective temperature (SSET) was retrieved from the Ka-band (36.5 GHz) brightness temperature (BT) and then used as input data for the estimation of SSM. In this study, SSET retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer of the Earth Observing System Radiometer (AMSR-E) Ka-band BT was validated against MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, and the results show that when the fraction of water surface (FWS) within an AMSR-E pixel increases in the range from 0-0.01 to 0.15-0.4, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) increases drastically from 1.98 to 11.42 Kelvin (K). When validation was conducted on SSET data retrieved with the K-band (18.7 and 23.8 GHz) BT, the RMSEs were maintained below 2.0 K for FWS ranging from 0 to 0.4. Therefore, in the original LPRM, we substituted the Ka-band BT with the K-band BT to produce more accurate estimations of SSET and hence improved SSM retrievals. Our results show that for FWS ranges of 0-0.01, 0.01-0.05, 0.05-0.15, and 0.15-0.4, the correlation coefficients ( R-values) between SSM retrieved with the improved LPRM and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) measurements are 0.78, 0.75, 0.77, and 0.46, respectively, compared with the corresponding R-values of 0.78, 0.65, 0.56, and 0.34 for SSM retrieved with the original LPRM. This demonstrates that against the original LPRM, our improved LPRM can produce more accurate SSM retrievals under water-land mixed pixels.

TI  - Dynamic assessment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and health risk using remote sensing and geo-spatial big data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few decades, extensive epidemiological studies have focused on exploring the adverse effects of PM2.5 (particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mu m) on public health. However, most of them failed to consider the dynamic changes of population distribution adequately and were limited by the accuracy of PM(2.5 )estimations. Therefore, in this study, location-based service (LBS) data from social media and satellite-derived high-quality PM2.5 concentrations were collected to perform highly spatiotemporal exposure assessments for thirteen cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China. The city-scale exposure levels and the corresponding health outcomes were first estimated. Then the uncertainties in exposure risk assessments were quantified based on in-situ PM2.5 observations and static population data. The results showed that approximately half of the population living in the BTH region were exposed to monthly mean PM2.5 concentration greater than 80 mu g/m(3) in 2015, and the highest risk was observed in December. In terms of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease, the premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 were estimated to be 138,150, 80,945, and 18,752, respectively. A comparative analysis between five different exposure models further illustrated that the dynamic population distribution and accurate PM2.5 estimations showed great influence on environmental exposure and health assessments and need be carefully considered. Otherwise, the results would be considerably over- or under-estimated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Patterns in the Use of Axillary Operations for Patients with Node-Positive Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A National Cancer Database (NCDB) Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Breast-Surgeons
CL  - Dallas, TX
AB  - Background The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1071 and Sentinel Neoadjuvant (SENTINA) trials of sentinel node biopsy for node-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) demonstrated false-negative rates that varied on the basis of surgical technique. This study evaluated trends in axillary operations before and after publication of these trials. Methods This study analyzed patients from National Cancer Database (NCDB) with clinical T0 through T4, N1 and N2, M0 breast cancer who received NAC from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015 and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The patients were divided into the following groups: SNB, ALND, and (SNB + ALND). Results Of the 32,036 evaluable patients identified in this study. 5565 had SNB, 19,930 had ALND, and 6541 had SNB + ALND. Compared with the ALND group, the SNB group was younger, had more invasive ductal cancers, and had lower clinical T- and N-stage disease (p < 0.001). The patients in the SNB group had a higher rate of estrogen receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, but a lower rate of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancer (p < 0.001). The nodal pathologic complete response (PCR) rate, defined as no residual invasive cancer, was 66.5% in the SNB group and 33.1% in the ALND group. Since 2013, the rate of ALND has decreased from 88.7 to 77.1% in both community and academic institutions (p < 0.001). Conclusion Since publication of the ACOSOG Z1071 and SENTINA trials, the national rates of ALND in node positive breast cancer treated with NAC have decreased despite reported false-negative SNB rates and lack of prospective outcome data regarding the oncologic safety of ALND omission.

TI  - CALCULATION OF THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF WATER TEMPERATURE IN THE BLACK SEA BY SATELLITE DATA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The studies on calculation of vertical distribution of water temperature in the Black Sea by satellite data are described. The research was carried out in the active layer of the deep part of the Black Sea at depths of 0 - 50 meters. The initial data of the actual water temperature values were station data or measurement from the ship data (OSD - Ocean Station data), data measured with the help of floats (PFL - Profiling float data) and satellite data of the sea surface temperature. Calculations were based on the definition of statistical dependencies between the values of water temperature at the neighboring levels of vertical temperature distribution in the Black Sea by OSD & PFL data of water temperature and the development of regression equations. Calculations showed statistically significant results in spring-autumn period. Correlation coefficients between the values of the water temperature on the neighboring levels in the Black Sea amounted to 0.88 - 0.99. To increase the accuracy of results the equations for the calculation of adjustments for the temperature of the water at depths: 10, 20, 25 and 50 meters were developed. Standard calculation errors of the vertical distribution of water temperature amounted to 2 degrees C in the Black Sea in 2017 year.

TI  - An Empirical Assessment of the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics and TIMESAT Land Surface Phenology Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of vegetation phenology at regional-to-global scales provide important information regarding seasonal variation in the fluxes of energy, carbon, and water between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Numerous algorithms have been developed to estimate phenological transition dates using time series of remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices. A key challenge, however, is that different algorithms provide inconsistent results. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) phenological transition dates estimated from 500 m MODIS data based on two widely used sources of such data: the TIMESAT program and the MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics (MLCD) product. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of land cover class, criteria used to identify SOS and EOS, and fitting algorithm (local versus global) on the transition dates estimated from time series of MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Satellite-derived transition dates from each source are compared against each other and against SOS and EOS dates estimated from PhenoCams distributed across the Northeastern United States and Canada. Our results show that TIMESAT and MLCD SOS transition dates are generally highly correlated (r = 0.51-0.97), except in Central Canada where correlation coefficients are as low as 0.25. Relative to SOS, EOS comparison shows lower agreement and higher magnitude of deviations. SOS and EOS dates are impacted by noise arising from snow and cloud contamination, and there is low agreement among results from TIMESAT, the MLCD product, and PhenoCams in vegetation types with low seasonal EVI amplitude or with irregular EVI time series. In deciduous forests, SOS dates from the MLCD product and TIMESAT agree closely with SOS dates from PhenoCams, with correlations as high as 0.76. Overall, our results suggest that TIMESAT is well-suited for local-to-regional scale studies because of its ability to tune algorithm parameters, which makes it more flexible than the MLCD product. At large spatial scales, where local tuning is not feasible, the MLCD product provides a readily available data set based on a globally consistent approach that provides SOS and EOS dates that are comparable to results from TIMESAT.

TI  - Radiometric Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance Consistency Assessment for Landsat 8/OLI, Sentinel-2/MSI, PROBA-V, and DEIMOS-1 over Libya-4 and RadCalNet Calibration Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a clear trend toward the use of higher spatial resolution satellite sensors. Due to the low revisit time of these sensors and frequent cloud coverage, many applications require data from different sensors to be combined in order to have more frequent observations. This raises concerns regarding data interoperability and consistency. The initial pre-requisite is that there are no radiometric differences in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. This paper aims to quantitatively assess differences in the TOA signal provided by PROBA-V, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, Landsat-8, and Deimos-1 by using observations over both the Libya-4 desert calibration site and the RadCalNet sites. The results obtained over the Libya-4 site indicate that for all sensors investigated, the inter-sensor deviations are negligible, i.e., within +/- 2% for comparable spectral bands, with the exception of the Deimos-1 Green band. Clear BRDF (bi-directional reflectance distribution function) effects were observed over the RadCalNet sites, thereby preventing consistent conclusions on inter-sensor deviations from being made. In order to fully explore the potential of the RadCalNet sites, it is recommended that BRDF characterizations be additionally incorporated into the RadCalNet simulations and made publicly available through the distribution portal.

TI  - Preoperative PET/CT does not accurately detect extrauterine disease in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer: A prospective study
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The identification of extrauterine disease is critical to the management of patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. The purpose of the current study was to determine the accuracy of preoperative positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in the detection of extrauterine disease. Methods Women with high-risk endometrial cancer were enrolled prospectively and underwent preoperative PET/CT followed by surgery, including sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymphadenectomy. Primary tumor factors on PET/CT were correlated with lymph node pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the detection of lymphadenopathy and peritoneal disease by PET/CT. Results A total of 112 patients were enrolled and underwent PET/CT between April 2013 and May 2016, 108 of whom were evaluable. On PET/CT, 21 patients (19.4%) were found to have extrauterine disease, 18 (17%) had positive lymph nodes, and 8 (7%) had peritoneal disease. A total of 108 patients underwent surgery, 103 of whom (95%) underwent lymphadenectomy. The sensitivity of PET/CT to detect positive lymph nodes was 45.8%, with a specificity of 91.1%, positive predictive value of 61.1%, and negative predictive value of 84.7%. The false-negative rate was 54.2%. There was no difference in primary tumor characteristics on imaging noted between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. The sensitivity of PET/CT to detect peritoneal disease was 37.5%, with a specificity of 97.8%, positive predictive value of 75%, and negative predictive value of 90.0%. The false-negative rate was 62.5%. Conclusions Preoperative PET/CT did not reliably predict the presence of extrauterine disease in women with high-risk endometrial cancer. Given the high false-negative rates, PET/CT should not be used in the preoperative treatment planning of these patients.

TI  - Steric Sea Level Changes from Ocean Reanalyses at Global and Regional Scales
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level has risen significantly in the recent decades and is expected to rise further based on recent climate projections. Ocean reanalyses that synthetize information from observing networks, dynamical ocean general circulation models, and atmospheric forcing data offer an attractive way to evaluate sea level trend and variability and partition the causes of such sea level changes at both global and regional scales. Here, we review recent utilization of reanalyses for steric sea level trend investigations. State-of-the-science ocean reanalysis products are then used to further infer steric sea level changes. In particular, we used an ensemble of centennial reanalyses at moderate spatial resolution (between 0.5 x 0.5 and 1 x 1 degree) and an ensemble of eddy-permitting reanalyses to quantify the trends and their uncertainty over the last century and the last two decades, respectively. All the datasets showed good performance in reproducing sea level changes. Centennial reanalyses reveal a 1900-2010 trend of steric sea level equal to 0.47 +/- 0.04 mm year(-1), in agreement with previous studies, with unprecedented rise since the mid-1990s. During the altimetry era, the latest vintage of reanalyses is shown to outperform the previous ones in terms of skill scores against the independent satellite data. They consistently reproduce global and regional upper ocean steric expansion and the association with climate variability, such as ENSO. However, the mass contribution to the global mean sea level rise is varying with products and its representability needs to be improved, as well as the contribution of deep and abyssal waters to the steric sea level rise. Similarly, high-resolution regional reanalyses for the European seas provide valuable information on sea level trends, their patterns, and their causes.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Turning the challenges of partitioning ecosystem evaporation and transpiration into opportunities
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) respond differently to ongoing changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and land use. It is difficult to partition ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration (ET) measurements into E and T, which makes it difficult to validate satellite data and land surface models. Here, we review current progress in partitioning E and T and provide a prospectus for how to improve theory and observations going forward. Recent advancements in analytical techniques create new opportunities for partitioning E and T at the ecosystem scale, but their assumptions have yet to be fully tested. For example, many approaches to partition E and T rely on the notion that plant canopy conductance and ecosystem water use efficiency exhibit optimal responses to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). We use observations from 240 eddy covariance flux towers to demonstrate that optimal ecosystem response to D is a reasonable assumption, in agreement with recent studies, but more analysis is necessary to determine the conditions for which this assumption holds. Another critical assumption for many partitioning approaches is that ET can be approximated as T during ideal transpiring conditions, which has been challenged by observational studies. We demonstrate that T can exceed 95% of ET from certain ecosystems, but other ecosystems do not appear to reach this value, which suggests that this assumption is ecosystem-dependent with implications for partitioning. It is important to further improve approaches for partitioning E and T, yet few multi-method comparisons have been undertaken to date. Advances in our understanding of carbon-water coupling at the stomatal, leaf, and canopy level open new perspectives on how to quantify T via its strong coupling with photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can be constrained at the ecosystem and global scales with emerging data sources including solar-induced fluorescence, carbonyl sulfide flux measurements, thermography, and more. Such comparisons would improve our mechanistic understanding of ecosystem water fluxes and provide the observations necessary to validate remote sensing algorithms and land surface models to understand the changing global water cycle.

TI  - Determination of Global Geodetic Parameters Using Satellite Laser Ranging Measurements to Sentinel-3 Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-3A/3B (S3A/B) satellites are equipped with a number of precise instruments dedicated to the measurement of surface topography, sea and land surface temperatures and ocean and land surface color. The high-precision orbit is guaranteed by three instruments: Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, laser retroreflector dedicated to Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) antenna. In this article, we check the possibility of using SLR observations and GPS-based reduced-dynamic orbits of active S3A/B satellites for the determination of global geodetic parameters, such as geocenter motion, Earth rotation parameters (ERPs) and the realization of the terrestrial reference frame, based on data from 2016-2018. The calculation process was preceded with the estimation of SLR site range biases, different network constraining tests and a different number of orbital arcs in the analyzed solutions. The repeatability of SLR station coordinates based solely on SLR observations to S3A/B is at the level of 8-16 mm by means of interquartile ranges even without network constraining in 7-day solutions. The combined S3A/B and LAGEOS solutions show a consistency of estimated station coordinates better than 13 mm, geocenter coordinates with a RMS of 6 mm, pole coordinates with a RMS of 0.19 mas and Length-of-day with a RMS of 0.07 ms/day when referred to the IERS-14-C04 series. The altimetry observations have to be corrected by the geocenter motion to obtain unbiased estimates of the mean sea level rise. The geocenter motion is typically derived from SLR measurements to passive LAGEOS cannonball-like satellites. We found, however, that SLR observations to active Sentinel satellites are well suited for the determination of global geodetic parameters, such as Earth rotation parameters and geocenter motion, which even further increases the potential applications of Sentinel missions for deriving geophysical parameters.

TI  - Sea Ice Extent Detection in the Bohai Sea Using Sentinel-3 OLCI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice distribution is an important indicator of ice conditions and regional climate change in the Bohai Sea (China). In this study, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of the Bohai Sea ice in the winter of 2017-2018 by developing sea ice information indexes using 300 m resolution Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) images. We assessed and validated the index performance using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images with higher spatial resolution. The results indicate that the proposed Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index (NDSIIIOLCI), which is based on OLCI Bands 20 and 21, can be used to rapidly and effectively detect sea ice but is somewhat affected by the turbidity of the seawater in the southern Bohai Sea. The novel Enhanced Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index (ENDSIIIOLCI), which builds on NDSIIIOLCI by also considering OLCI Bands 12 and 16, can monitor sea ice more accurately and effectively than NDSIIIOLCI and suffers less from interference from turbidity. The spatiotemporal evolution of the Bohai Sea ice in the winter of 2017-2018 was successfully monitored by ENDSIIIOLCI. The results show that this sea ice information index based on OLCI data can effectively extract sea ice extent for sediment-laden water and is well suited for monitoring the evolution of Bohai Sea ice in winter.

TI  - Joint Retrieval of Growing Season Corn Canopy LAI and Leaf Chlorophyll Content by Fusing Sentinel-2 and MODIS Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous and accurate estimates of crop canopy leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content are of great importance for crop growth monitoring. These estimates can be useful for precision agricultural management and agricultural planning. Our objectives were to investigate the joint retrieval of corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content using filtered reflectances from Sentinel-2 and MODIS data acquired during the corn growing season, which, being generally hot and rainy, results in few cloud-free Sentinel-2 images. In addition, the retrieved time series of LAI and chlorophyll content results were used to monitor the corn growth behavior in the study area. Our results showed that: (1) the joint retrieval of LAI and chlorophyll content using the proposed joint probability distribution method improved the estimation accuracy of both corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content. Corn canopy LAI and chlorophyll content were retrieved jointly and accurately using the PROSAIL model with fused Kalman filtered (KF) reflectance images. The relation between retrieved and field measured LAI and chlorophyll content of four corn-growing stages had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of about 0.6, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranges of mainly 0.1-0.2 and 0.0-0.3, respectively. (2) Kalman filtering is a good way to produce continuous high-resolution reflectance images by synthesizing Sentinel-2 and MODIS reflectances. The correlation between fused KF and Sentinel-2 reflectances had an R-2 value of 0.98 and RMSE of 0.0133, and the correlation between KF and field-measured reflectances had an R-2 value of 0.8598 and RMSE of 0.0404. (3) The derived continuous KF reflectances captured the crop behavior well. Our analysis showed that the LAI increased from day of year (DOY) 181 (trefoil stage) to DOY 236 (filling stage), and then increased continuously until harvest, while the chlorophyll content first also increased from DOY 181 to DOY 236, and then remained stable until harvest. These results revealed that the jointly retrieved continuous LAI and chlorophyll content could be used to monitor corn growth conditions.

TI  - Extraction of Information on Trees outside Forests Based on Very High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sparse Ulmus pumila L. woodland in the Otingdag Sandy Land of China is indispensable in maintaining the ecosystem stability of the desertified grasslands. Many studies of this region have focused on community structure and analysis of species composition, but without consideration of spatial distribution. Based on a combination of spectral and multiscale spatial variation features, we present a method for automated extraction of information on the U. pumila trees of the Otingdag Sandy Land using very high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. In this method, feature images were constructed using fused 1-m spatial resolution GF-2 images through analysis of the characteristics of the natural geographical environment and the spatial distribution of the U. pumila trees. Then, a multiscale Laplace transform was performed on the feature images to generate multiscale Laplacian feature spaces. Next, local maxima and minima were obtained by iteration over the multiscale feature spaces. Finally, repeated values were removed and vector data (point data) were generated for automatic extraction of the spatial distribution and crown contours of the U. pumila trees. Results showed that the proposed method could overcome the lack of universality common to image classification methods. Validation indicated the accuracy of information extracted from U. pumila test data reached 82.7%. Further analysis determined the parameter values of the algorithm applicable to the study area. Extraction accuracy was improved considerably with a gradual increase of the Sigma parameter; however, the probability of missing data also increased markedly after the parameter reached a certain level. Therefore, we recommend the Sigma value of the algorithm be set to 90 (+/- 5). The proposed method could provide a reference for information extraction, spatial distribution mapping, and forest protection in relation to the U. pumila woodland of the Otingdag Sandy Land, which could also support improved ecological protection across much of northern China.

TI  - New On-Orbit Calibration Approach of SNPP VIIRS Reflective Solar Bands Using the Full Profile of Direct Solar Illumination of Solar Diffuser
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodological variant of the standard on-orbit calibration of reflective solar bands (RSBs) is presented for the Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) housed in the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The new variant uses the full profile of direct solar illumination of the solar diffuser (SD), including both full and partial illuminations, to characterize the on-orbit gain change of the RSBs, differing from the standard approach that uses a smaller "sweet spot" subinterval within the full-illumination stage. The extended incident angular range of the solar light requires a new characterization analysis of the impact of the transmission function of the SD screen, SD bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), and other affected calibration steps. Instead of the standard a priori derivation of the known characterization functions for the wider range, this analysis directly characterizes their manifested impact in the instrument data through a step-by-step extraction from a selected three-year period to build up a series of intermediate functions that are applicable mission-long. This newly adopted procedure presents a significant simplification as well as more clarity of the characterization analysis. The new RSB calibration coefficient of the full-profile approach is extracted for all 14 RSBs of SNPP VIIRS and is shown to be stable and smooth at the level of 0.1%. For bands M5 and above, the full-profile result achieves excellent agreement with the standard result, whereas results for bands M1-M4 diverge, in particular up to 2% for band M1, the shortest wavelength RSB at 410 nm. The finding elucidates a key challenge of the on-orbit RSB calibration arising from the nontrivial angular dependence of the on-orbit degradation of SD that introduces calibration error into any SD-based approach, such that the on-orbit RSB calibration result is not stable with different choices of the angular range of incident and outgoing light with respect to the SD. A detailed discussion of the nontrivial angular dependence in SD degradation is provided in the context of the known on-orbit RSB calibration results and recent findings, including discrepancy with the lunar-based calibration for bands M1-M4.

TI  - Evaluating urban heat island intensity and its associated determinants of towns and cities continuum in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is known as a main environmental problem within urban agglomerations due to its associated urban growth, human mobility and socioeconomic expansion. The UHI intensity (UHII) generally varies with the changes in the urban size. Although numerous researches have highlighted the monitoring and quantification of the spatial-temporal dynamics characteristics of UHI effects in larger-scale central cities, there is still limited understanding regarding variations in the UHI effects over smaller human settlements (e.g., towns). This study aims to fill this gap by considering the towns and cities as a continuum to examine the inner-annual dynamics of the UHII and its various determinants within the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations (YRDUA). To investigate the changes in the land surface temperature (LST), we utilized an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to reconstruct the MODIS 8-day LST data with a 1 km(2) resolution in 2015. The results showed that a UHI existed extensively in most of the towns and cities over the YRDUA region during the time. The mean UHII in the summer months was greater than that during the winter, while the nighttime value was lower than that during the daytime. The LST difference between urban and rural areas increased with urban expansion. Compared with the other influencing factors, urban cluster size and the perimeter of urban extent polygon were the relatively important variables to explain the variations in the UHII. This empirical study could provide useful information to mitigate the UHI of towns and cities continuum through top-level design and land-use planning of urban agglomerations.

TI  - Synchronous Response Analysis of Features for Remote Sensing Crop Classification Based on Optical and SAR Time-Series Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop classification is the basis of agricultural research, and remote sensing is the only effective measuring technique to classify crops over large areas. Optical remote sensing is effective in regions with good illumination; however, it usually fails to meet requirements for highly accurate crop classification in cloud-covered areas and rainy regions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can achieve active data acquisition by transmitting signals; thus, it has strong resistance to cloud and rain interference. In this study, we designed an improved crop planting structure mapping framework for cloudy and rainy regions by combining optical data and SAR data, and we revealed the synchronous-response relationship of these two data types. First, we extracted geo-parcels from optical images with high spatial resolution. Second, we built a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifier suitable for remote sensing images on the geo-parcel scale. Third, we classified crops based on the two datasets and established the network. Fourth, we analyzed the synchronous response relationships of crops based on the results of the two classification schemes. This work is the basis for the application of remote sensing data for the fine mapping and growth monitoring of crop planting structures in cloudy and rainy areas in the future.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF RICE FIELD PHENOLOGY USING SENTINEL-1 IMAGE IN KARAWANG REGENCY WEST JAVA, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paddy is an important food crop for Indonesian people. It has become the primary staple food and the most gradually increased crop regarding its productivity. It recorded in 2015 that national production for paddy field was 15.13% produced byWest Java province. With the national food security issues, monitoring in rice field growth becomes important to give some baseline information regarding the provision of staple food. The phase begins when the rice is planted in the ground and ends when the rice is ready for harvesting. Rice phenology divided into five classes, namely, land preparation, early vegetative, late vegetative, generative, and harvesting. One of the effective ways in monitoring is through rapid measurement using a remote sensing system, in this case, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The objective of the study to implement Sentinel-1 image in a spatiotemporal analysis of the rice field phenology. Sentinel-1 images at the C-Band are capable of monitoring rice phenology. The study aims to provide a spatial and temporal assessment of rice phenology in Karawang using Sentinel-1 images. As results, in northern irrigation area, the paddy is grown quickly even it receives water last compared to southern and middle Karawang irrigation areas. Furthermore, we found that the rice phenology phase distribution in Karawang does not follow the irrigation pattern. Rice in northern irrigation areas have the lowest backscatter values. The temporal analysis shows that rice reaches the harvesting stage quicker in dry season compared to the rainy season with the same backscatter values.

TI  - Novel technique for developing flood hazard map by using AHP: a study on part of Mahanadi River in Odisha
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, Odisha state experienced major natural hazards like floods and cyclones. Floods were experienced fifteen times during 2001-2018 and had two major catastrophic cyclones (super-cyclone 1999 and Phailin 2013). Flood is triggered due to meteorological, hydrological, and terrain conditions at any given place. Considering the terrain parameters namely elevation, slope, drainage density, soil and land use/land cover as the contributing factors for flood inundation, a new technique is developed to calculate flood hazard using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Using multi-temporal satellite derived flood extent, spatial flood frequency map (SFFM) were generated based on the frequency of inundation. SFFM which represents the observed flood extent on ground at different magnitudes of flood and the terrain conditions on the ground are used synergistically for generating the hazard map. Part of Mahanadi River in Odisha which is highly flood-prone is taken for analysis in this study. More than 100 satellite data sets both microwave SAR and optical data acquired at different magnitudes of flood during 2001-2018 were analysed to prepare the SFFM maps. Pair wise comparison rating was given among flood producing factors and weightage of each factor was computed by using GIS based AHP and multi-criteria evaluation techniques. The individual derived weights (in percentage) of the contributing factors obtained were 50.874 for SFFM, 22.775 for elevation, 10.966 for drainage density, 7.225 for slope, 5.914 for land use and 2.936 for soil. Further, the layers were used in weighted overlay tool and respective weights in percentage were given for generating the flood hazard map in GIS environment. The flood hazard was classified into five hazard classes i.e. very high, high, moderate, low, and very low and corresponding hazard area was estimated to be 7467 ha, 12,871 ha, 28,700 ha, 35,518 ha and 292 ha respectively. These statistics and hazard map will help the concerned local authorities for formulating strategic policies for land use planning and minimize the effect of flood on agricultural land and human lives.

TI  - Micro-Spatial Analysis of Maize Yield Gap Variability and Production Factors on Smallholder Farms
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Site-specific land management practice taking into account variability in maize yield gaps (the difference between yields in the 90th percentiles and other yields on smallholder farmers' fields) could improve resource use efficiency and enhance yields. However, the applicability of the practice is constrained by inability to identify patterns of resource utilization to target application of resources to more responsive fields. The study focus was to map yield gaps on smallholder fields based on identified spatial arrangements differentiated by distance from the smallholder homestead and understand field-specific utilization of production factors. This was aimed at understanding field variability based on yield gap mapping patterns in order to enhance resource use efficiency on smallholder farms. The study was done in two villages, Mukuyu and Shikomoli, with high and low agroecology regarding soil fertility in Western Kenya. Identification of spatial arrangements at 40 m, 80 m, 150 m and 300 m distance from the homestead on smallholder farms for 70 households was done. The spatial arrangements were then classified into near house, mid farm and far farm basing on distance from the homestead. For each spatial arrangement, Landsat sensors acquired via satellite imagery were processed to generate yield gap maps. The focal statistics analysis method using the neighborhoods function was then applied to generate yield gap maps at the different spatial arrangements identified above. Socio-economic, management and biophysical factors were determined, and maize yields estimated at each spatial arrangement. Heterogeneous patterns of high, average and low yield gaps were found in spatial arrangements at the 40 m and 80 m distances. Nearly homogenous patterns tending towards median yield gap values were found in spatial arrangements that were located at the 150 m and 300 m. These patterns correspondingly depicted field-specific utilization of management and socio-economic factors. Field level management practices and socio-economic factors such as application of inorganic fertilizer, high frequency of weed control, early land preparation, high proportion of hired and family labor use and allocation of large land sizes were utilized in spatial arrangements at 150 and 300 m distances. High proportions of organic fertilizer and family labor use were utilized in spatial arrangements at 40 and 80 m distances. The findings thus show that smallholder farmers preferentially manage the application of socio-economic and management factors in spatial arrangements further from the homestead compared to fields closer to the homestead which could be exacerbating maize yield gaps. Delineating management zones based on yield gap patterns at the different spatial arrangements on smallholder farms could contribute to site-specific land management and enhance yields. Investigating the value smallholder farmers attach to each spatial arrangement is further needed to enhance the spatial understanding of yield gap variation on smallholder farms.

TI  - Tropical bird species richness is strongly associated with patterns of primary productivity captured by the Dynamic Habitat Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity science and conservation alike require environmental indicators to understand species richness and predict species distribution patterns. The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are a set of three indices that summarize annual productivity measures from satellite data for biodiversity applications, and include: a) cumulative annual productivity; b) minimum annual productivity; and c) variation in annual productivity. At global scales and in temperate regions the DHIs predict species diversity patterns well, but the DHIs have not been tested in the tropics, where higher levels of productivity lead to the saturation of many remotely sensed vegetation indices. Our goal was to explain bird species richness patterns based on the DHIs in tropical areas. We related the DHIs to species richness of resident landbirds for five guilds (forest, scrub, grassland, generalist, and all resident birds) based on a) species distribution model (SDM) maps for 217 species, and b) range map for 564 species across Thailand. We also quantified the relative importance of the DHIs in multiple regression models that included two measures of topography, and two climate metrics using multiple regression, best-subsets, and hierarchical partitioning analyses. We found that the three DHIs alone explained forest bird richness best (R-adj(2) 0.61 for both SDM- and rangemap based richness; 0.15-0.54 for the other guilds). When combining the DHIs with topography and climate, the richness of both forest birds and all resident bird species was equally well explained (R-adj(2) 0.85 and 0.67 versus 0.81 and 0.68). Among the three DHIs, cumulative annual productivity had the greatest explanatory power for all guilds based on SDM richness maps (R-adj(2) 0.54-0.61). The strong relationship between the DHIs and bird species richness in Thailand suggests that the DHIs capture energy availability well and are useful in biodiversity assessments and potentially bird conservation in tropical areas.

TI  - Hydroxyl-Group Identification Using O K-Edge XAFS in Porous Glass Fabricated by Hydrothermal Reaction and Low-Temperature Foaming
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Porous glass was prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of sodium borosilicate glass, and oxygen-ion characterization was used to identify the hydroxyl groups in its surface area. A substantial amount of "water" was introduced into the ionic structure as either OH- groups or H2O molecules through the hydrothermal reaction. When the hydrothermally treated glass was reheated at normal pressures, a porous structure was formed due to the low-temperature foaming resulting from the evaporation of H2O molecules and softening of the glass. Although it was expected that the OH- groups would remain in the porous glass, their distribution required clarification. Oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy enables the bonding states of oxygen ions in the surface area and interior to be characterized using the electron yield (EY) and fluorescence yield (FY) mode, respectively. The presence of OH- groups was detected in the O K-edge XAFS spectrum of the porous glass prepared by hydrothermal reaction with a corresponding pre-edge peak energy of 533.1 eV. In addition, comparison of the XAFS spectra obtained in the EY and FY modes revealed that the OH- groups were mainly distributed in the surface area (depths of several tens of nanometers).

T2  - JOURNAL OF CHRISTIAN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Though unpublished in peer-reviewed literature for more than 40 years, the Theory of Nursing for the Whole Person has been, and remains, a highly useful framework for nursing practice, education, and research. Used by the College of Nursing at Oral Roberts University, the theory was developed by the founding dean, I. Tomine Tjelta. Founded on a Christian worldview, the theory is built on the basic nursing paradigm concepts, yet functions as a distinctly scriptural framework.The theory's five conceptual triads describe how nursing addresses the whole-person health-illness continuum for individuals, families, and communities.

TI  - A method for downscaling daily evapotranspiration based on 30-m surface resistance
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a new method for downscaling actual evapotranspiration from resolution of 1-km to 30-m. The disaggregation approach is performed using the Jarvis model to simulate surface resistance, which describes the restriction of vapor from land surface, in the water exchange process without using land surface temperature data. The integrated surface resistance model, which takes climate indicators and canopy conditions into account, is primarily validated using in situ observations and employed in the downscaling model with considerable accuracy covering an entire growing season (April-October) in Zhangye Oasis. Good performance and good agreements between daily downscaled results and flux records from an EC (Eddy Covariance) tower have been obtained. The coefficient of determination (R-2) ranges from 0.80 to 0.91, and the mean bias (MB) ranges from 0.17 to 0.72. The vegetation growth process is also captured well by the downscaled results. The proposed method in this research performs better than downscaling approach based on land surface temperature. The accurate validation results and detailed spatial patterns suggest that the proposed downscaling strategy is reliable for water resource management.

TI  - Sentinel Based Malicious Relay Detection in Wireless IoT Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased device connectivity and information sharing in wireless IoT networks increases the risk of cyber attack by malicious nodes. In this paper, we present an effective and practical scheme for detecting data integrity and selective forwarding attacks launched by malicious relays in wireless IoT networks. The proposed scheme exploits the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and provides a sentinel based approach to intrusion detection. Our detection scheme assumes a general noise model for the network where different wireless links may have different packet error probability (PEP). Further, our detection scheme is effective even in scenarios where different wireless links in the network employ distinct modulation and coding schemes at the physical layer. This detection scheme has application in practical wireless IoT networks, such as those based on the recently introduced IEEE 802.11ah standard.

TI  - Isolation, genetic analysis of the first Akabane virus from goat in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Akabane virus (AKAV) is an important insect-borne virus belonging to the genus Orthobunyavirus, the Peribunyaviridae family. An AKAV defined as GXDH 01 here, was isolated for the first time from blood from a sentinel goat in China in 2016, and its full-length open reading frames (ORFs) were sequenced in this study. Sequence analysis suggested that the isolate GXDH 01 probably had undergone a reassortment incident and acquired L segments from other strain originating from an attenuated vaccine, such as OBE-1. This study aims to provide more understanding as to the origin and epidemiology of AKAV in China.

TI  - Generating High Spatio-Temporal Resolution Fractional Vegetation Cover by Fusing GF-1 WFV and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important indicator to characterize the surface vegetation, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for earth surface process simulation. However, due to technical limitations and the influence of weather, it is difficult to generate temporally continuous FVC with high spatio-temporal resolution based on a single remote-sensing data source. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of generating high spatio-temporal resolution FVC based on the fusion of GaoFen-1 Wide Field View (GF-1 WFV) data and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Two fusion strategies were employed to identify a suitable fusion method: (i) fusing reflectance data from GF-1 WFV and MODIS firstly and then estimating FVC from the reflectance fusion result (strategy FC, Fusion_then_FVC). (ii) fusing the FVC estimated from GF-1 WFV and MODIS reflectance data directly (strategy CF, FVC_then_Fusion). The FVC generated using strategies FC and CF were evaluated based on FVC estimated from the real GF-1 WFV data and the field survey FVC, respectively. The results indicated that strategy CF achieved higher accuracies with less computational cost than those of strategy FC both in the comparisons with FVC estimated from the real GF-1 WFV (CF:R-2 = 0.9580, RMSE = 0.0576; FC: R-2 = 0.9345, RMSE = 0.0719) and the field survey FVC data (CF: R-2 = 0.8138, RMSE = 0.0985; FC: R-2 = 0.7173, RMSE = 0.1214). Strategy CF preserved spatial details more accurately than strategy FC and had a lower probability of generating abnormal values. It could be concluded that fusing GF-1 WFV and MODIS data for generating high spatio-temporal resolution FVC with good quality was feasible, and strategy CF was more suitable for generating FVC given its advantages in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.

TI  - Fusing multi-source data to map spatio-temporal dynamics of winter rape on the Jianghan Plain and Dongting Lake Plain, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping crop distribution with remote sensing data is of great importance for agricultural production, food security and agricultural sustainability. Winter rape is an important oil crop, which plays an important role in the cooking oil market of China. The Jianghan Plain and Dongting Lake Plain (JPDLP) are major agricultural production areas in China. Essential changes in winter rape distribution have taken place in this area during the 21st century. However, the pattern of these changes remains unknown. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of winter rape from 2000 to 2017 on the JPDLP were analyzed. An artificial neural network (ANN)-based classification method was proposed to map fractional winter rape distribution by fusing moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) data and high-resolution imagery. The results are as follows: (1) The total winter rape acreages on the JPDLP dropped significantly, especially on the Jianghan Plain with a decline of about 45% during 2000 and 2017. (2) The winter rape abundance keeps changing with about 20-30% croplands changing their abundance drastically in every two consecutive observation years. (3) The winter rape has obvious regional differentiation for the trend of its change at the county level, and the decreasing trend was observed more strongly in the traditionally dominant agricultural counties.

TI  - Detection of Archaeological Looting from Space: Methods, Achievements and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Illegal excavations in archaeological heritage sites (namely "looting") are a global phenomenon. Satellite images are nowadays massively used by archaeologists to systematically document sites affected by looting. In parallel, remote sensing scientists are increasingly developing processing methods with a certain degree of automation to quantify looting using satellite imagery. To capture the state-of-the-art of this growing field of remote sensing, in this work 47 peer-reviewed research publications and grey literature are reviewed, accounting for: (i) the type of satellite data used, i.e., optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR); (ii) properties of looting features utilized as proxies for damage assessment (e.g., shape, morphology, spectral signature); (iii) image processing workflows; and (iv) rationale for validation. Several scholars studied looting even prior to the conflicts recently affecting the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Regardless of the method used for looting feature identification (either visual/manual, or with the aid of image processing), they preferred very high resolution (VHR) optical imagery, mainly black-and-white panchromatic, or pansharpened multispectral, whereas SAR is being used more recently by specialist image analysts only. Yet the full potential of VHR and high resolution (HR) multispectral information in optical imagery is to be exploited, with limited research studies testing spectral indices. To fill this gap, a range of looted sites across the MENA region are presented in this work, i.e., Lisht, Dashur, and Abusir el Malik (Egypt), and Tell Qarqur, Tell Jifar, Sergiopolis, Apamea, Dura Europos, and Tell Hizareen (Syria). The aim is to highlight: (i) the complementarity of HR multispectral data and VHR SAR with VHR optical imagery, (ii) usefulness of spectral profiles in the visible and near-infrared bands, and (iii) applicability of methods for multi-temporal change detection. Satellite data used for the demonstration include: HR multispectral imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation, VHR X-band SAR data from the COSMO-SkyMed mission, VHR panchromatic and multispectral WorldView-2 imagery, and further VHR optical data acquired by GeoEye-1, IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, and WorldView-3, available through Google Earth. Commonalities between the different image processing methods are examined, alongside a critical discussion about automation in looting assessment, current lack of common practices in image processing, achievements in managing the uncertainty in looting feature interpretation, and current needs for more dissemination and user uptake. Directions toward sharing and harmonization of methodologies are outlined, and some proposals are made with regard to the aspects that the community working with satellite images should consider, in order to define best practices of satellite-based looting assessment.

TI  - Impact of Gene Expression Profile Testing on the Management of Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Dermatologists
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is increasing likely due to improved detection and a growing elderly population. Although the prognosis of cSCC is excellent with complete surgical excision, many patients who go on to develop metastasis are initially classified as low-risk. The most commonly used staging systems, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and Brigham Women's Hospital (BWH), have low sensitivity and low positive predictive value for predicting metastasis. A gene expression profile test (cSCC-GEP) is in development to identify patients with cSCC at high risk for metastasis and death.Objective: To determine the impact of cSCC-GEP test results on management decisions made by dermatologists for cSCC patients.Design, Setting, and Participants: 402 dermatologists attending a national dermatology conference completed an online survey designed to determine the impact of cSCC-GEP test results on management decisions in a variety of clinical situations. Participants answered a series of questions related to three cSCC patient vignettes, each featuring different patient and lesion characteristics.Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of dermatologists who would recommend radiation, chemotherapy/immunotherapy, or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) for each patient vignette (without cSCC-GEP results, with a lower risk result, or with a higher risk result). The effect of the test results on the follow-up intervals recommended by dermatologists was also examined.Results: In the majority of vignettes, a lower risk cSCC-GEP test result led to a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of dermatologists who would recommend radiation, chemotherapy/immunotherapy, SLNBx, or quarterly follow-up. Conversely, a higher risk cSCC-GEP result significantly altered management toward increased intensity (more recommendations for radiation, chemotherapy/immunotherapy, SLNBx, or quarterly follow-up) in all vignettes.Conclusions and Relevance: The results of a cSCC-GEP test appear to significantly impact decisions made by dermatologists regarding subsequent management, SLNBx, and follow-up intervals for patients with cSCC.

TI  - Evaluation of surface shortwave and longwave downwelling radiations over the global tropical oceans
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, daily downwelling shortwave (Q(S)) and longwave radiation (Q(L)) data from one satellite and two hybrid products have been evaluated using Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array during 2001-2009 in the tropical oceans. Daily satellite data are used from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) program. Data are obtained using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (CM) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Coordinated Ocean Research Experiments (CORE-II) and Tropical Flux data (TropFlux) are the other two hybrid products used in this study. The analysis shows that majority of Q(S) observations as well as derived products lie in 200-300 Wm(-2) range in all the three tropical oceans. Both Q(S) and Q(L) in all products overestimated the majority of the observations. Yet, they underestimated the lower (0-100 Wm(-2)) values in Q(S) and higher (300-440 Wm(-2)) values in Q(L). Majority of the Q(L) observations lie within 390-420 Wm(-2) range, and CM slightly overestimated this observed distribution in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. But, majority of the observations in the Indian Ocean lie within 420-450 Wm(-2) range. This implies that the tropical Indian Ocean receives 30 Wm(-2) more energy as compared to the tropical Pacific and the Atlantic in the form of downwelling longwave radiation. Daily observed Q(S) shows dominant seasonal cycle over the central, the eastern Pacific and the eastern Atlantic. On the other hand, the western Pacific, the central Atlantic and the Indian Oceans show intraseasona I variations. All products show this variation with high root-mean-square error (RMSE) values (Q(S) and Q(L) ) over the Indian Ocean than in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. Downwelling radiation from CORE-II shows highest RMSE (for both Q(S) and Q(L) ) with least correlation coefficient (CC), and TropFlux has lowest RMSE and highest CC among all products in all three tropical oceans. CM has intermediate values of standard deviation, CC and RMSE. These results are not seasonally dependent, since the seasonal statistics are consistent with seasonal changes. Assuming that the SST is only driven by the downwelling shortwave and longwave fluxes, the errors associated with monthly SST can be as large as 0.2-0.3 (0.1-0.2) degrees C associated with errors in Q(S) (Q(L)). Both Q(S) and Q(L) in CORE-II have lower spatial variability as compared to other datasets. Q(L) in the tropical oceans shows seasonal spatial variability determined by intertropical convergence zone positions. This variability does not change significantly over the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. The summer and winter monsoon patterns in the Indian Ocean guide the Q(L) variability. Opposite to Q(S), higher Q(L) values have lower variability. Thus, this study aims at finding better radiation dataset to use in the numerical models and deduce that satellite data could be an alternative to existing reanalysis products.

TI  - Trends of land surface phenology derived from passive microwave and optical remote sensing systems and associated drivers across the dry tropics 1992-2012
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in vegetation phenology are among the most sensitive biological responses to global change. While land surface phenological changes in the Northern Hemisphere have been extensively studied from the widely used long-term AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data, current knowledge on land surface phenological trends and the associated drivers remains uncertain for the tropics. This uncertainty is partly due to the well-known challenges of applying satellite-derived vegetation indices from the optical domain in areas prone to frequent cloud cover. The long-term vegetation optical depth (VOD) product from satellite passive microwaves features less sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations and measures different vegetation traits and functioning as compared to optical sensors. VOD thereby provides an independent and complementary data source for studying land surface phonology and here we performed a combined analysis of the VOD and AVHRR NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets for the dry tropics (25 degrees N to 25 degrees S) during 1992-2012. We find a general delay in the VOD derived start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) as compared to NDVI derived metrics, however with clear differences among land cover and continents. Pixels characterized by significant phenological trends (P < 0.05) account for up to 20% of the study area for each phenological metric of NDVI and VOD, with large spatial difference between the two sensor systems. About 50% of the pixels studied show significant phonological changes in either VOD or NDVI metrics. Drivers of phonological changes were assessed for pixels of high agreement between VOD and NDVI phenological metrics (serving as a means of reducing noise-related uncertainty). We find rainfall variability and woody vegetation change to be the main forcing variables of phenological trends for most of the dry tropical biomes, while fire events and land cover change are recognized as second-order drivers. Taken together, our study provides new insights on land surface phonological changes and the associated drivers in the dry tropics, as based on the complementary long-term data sources of VOD and NDVI, sensitive to changes in vegetation water content and greenness, respectively.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy with cervical injection of indocyanine green in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer: predictors of unsuccessful mapping
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To identify predictors of unsuccessful sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) undergoing surgical staging with cervical injection of indocyanine green and SLN biopsy.Methods. We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with EC with attempted SLN biopsy between June 2014 and June 2016 at our institution. Patients were grouped according to whether they had a successful procedure, defined as the bilateral identification of SLNs, or an unsuccessful procedure, defined as unilateral or no SLN mapping. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of an unsuccessful procedure.Results. Among 327 patients included in the analysis, 256 (78.3%) had a successful procedure and 71 (21.7%) had an unsuccessful procedure (15.0% unilateral SLN mapping, 6.7% no mapping). The rate of successful procedure increased from 57.7% to 83.3% between the first and last quarters of the 2-year study period, which represented the learning curve for the technique. The mean (SD) operative time decreased from 164 (55) to 137 (37) minutes. By multivariable analysis, lysis of adhesions at the beginning of surgery (odds ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.56-6.07) and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes (odds ratio, 4.69; 95% CI, 1.82-12.11) were independently associated with an unsuccessful procedure.Conclusions. Lysis of adhesions at the beginning of surgery and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes independently affect the bilateral detection of SLNs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Simulations of starspot anomalies within TESS exoplanetary transit light curves I. Detection limits of starspot anomalies in TESS light curves
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. The primary targets of the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) are K and M dwarf stars within our solar neighbourhood. Young K and M dwarf stars are known to exhibit a high starspot coverage (approximate to 50%), however, older stars are known to show fewer starspots. This implies that TESS transit light curves at 2 min cadence may contain starspot anomalies, and if so, will require transit-starspot models to determine accurately the properties of the system.Aims. The goals are to determine if starspot anomalies can manifest in TESS transit light curves, to determine the detection limits of the starspot anomalies, and to examine the relationship between the change in flux caused by the starspot anomaly and the planetary transit.Methods. We conducted 20 573 simulations of planetary transits around spotted stars using the transit-starspot model, PRISM. In total 3888 different scenarios were considered using three different host star spectral types, M4V, M1V, and K5V. The mean amplitude of the starspot anomaly was measured and compared to the photometric precision of the light curve to determine if the characteristic "blip" of the starspot anomaly was noticeable in the light curve.Results. The simulations show that starspot anomalies are observable in TESS 2 min cadence data. The smallest starspot detectable in TESS transit light curves has a radius of approximate to 1900 km. The starspot detection limits for the three host stars are 4900 +/- 1700 km (M4V), 13 800 +/- 6000 km (M1V), and 15 900 +/- 6800 km (K5V). The smallest change in flux of the starspot (Delta F-spot = 0.00015 +/- 0.00001) can be detected when the ratio of planetary to stellar radii k = 0.082 +/- 0.004.Conclusions. The results confirm known dependencies between the amplitude of the starspot anomaly and the photometric parameters of the light curve. The results facilitated the characterisation of the relationship between the change in flux of the starspot anomaly and the change in flux of the planetary transit for TESS transit light curves.

TI  - The Good, the Bad, and the Ordinary: The Day-of-the-Week Effect on Mood Across the Globe
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The weekly peak of mood has fascinated academics and the mass public alike. However, this phenomenon has not been explored from a global perspective. By analyzing large-scale cross-national survey data collected from the Global Attitude Survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2014-2015, this paper offers cross-national evidence focusing on reporting a good or bad day across 46 countries. It was found that daily moods show a clear weekly cycle of feeling a "good day" (versus "ordinary" or "bad" day), but whether one is having a "best possible life", a cognitive evaluation of life conditions this study uses, does not vary over the week. Religion appears to be a key explanatory factor. While Christians are not more likely to report a "good mood" than Muslims or those identifying with other religions, they appear to enjoy a "best possible life", implying stronger influences by their distinctive worldview and sense of comfort. Also, the percentage of Christians in the whole population constitutes a very important structural context, such that in Christian-majority countries, Saturday and Sunday generated more good day reports than elsewhere. Muslim societies produce a very delightful context on Fridays. Other social structural conditions such as national wealth or income distribution generate mixed evidence. Policy implications are discussed in the conclusion.

TI  - Monitoring land-cover and land-use dynamics in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China is a biodiversity hotspot that is part of a larger, multi-use landscape where tourism, farming, grazing, and other land uses occur. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs that encourage afforestation on farmlands may be important drivers of land-cover and land-use change in the region that surrounds FNNR. Our objective is to monitor and examine vegetation and land-use changes, including PES-related afforestation, between 1989 and 2017. We utilize several image processing techniques, such as illumination normalization approaches to suppress terrain effects, and multi-seasonal image compositing to minimize persistent cloud cover. Ancillary data were also incorporated to generate reliable vegetation and land-use change information. A random forest machine learning image classification routine is implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform and refined using optimal classifier parameter tuning. Land-use transitions are identified and mapped with the implementation of stable training sites, discrete image classification, and logical land-use transition rules. Accuracy assessment results indicate our change detection workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor long-term forest cover and land-use changes in this mountainous, forested, and cloud prevalent region. We quantify the area of new built development and afforestation land and found that most of the land transitions took place in reserve buffer and its adjacent environs. For example, less than 2 km(2) of new built was identified within the reserve boundary compared to 25 km(2) for the entire study area between 1995 and 2016. We also shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of using Google Earth Engine for land-cover and land-use change studies. This efficient and open-access technique is important not only for assessing environmental changes and PES efficacy, but also for evaluating other conservation policies elsewhere.

TI  - Temperature-Correction Method for Directional Polarimetric Camera
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature change affects the accuracy of the radiometric calibration of the directional polarimetric camera (DPC). The first step in scientific remote-sensing data processing is temperature correction. Herein, we analyze the influence of temperature change based on the DPC working principle and the polarization-measurement model. Combined with the thermal-control design and thermal vacuum test, we develop a temperature-compensation -correction method aiming at the influence of radiation measurement. We design a temperature-response test scheme for in-orbit temperature conditions at different stages to monitor external conditions which affect test data and effectively eliminate the influence of the detector-frame transfer effect, and obtain the relationship between the radiation calibration coefficient and the temperature-change response. According to the analysis of experimental data and in-orbit data, the radiation measurement error caused by temperature change reduces to less than + 0.1% through real-time measurement of the dark-background channel and through the temperature-correction method of radiation-response-coefficient compensation, which meets the requirements of in-orbit radiation correction.

TI  - In the Service of World Revolution: Vietnamese Communists' Radical Ambitions through the Three Indochina Wars
T2  - JOURNAL OF COLD WAR STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The terms "decolonization" and "Cold War" refer to specific processes and periods in the international system, but they do not capture the full agency of local actors such as Vietnamese Communists. Based on recently available archival materials from Hanoi, this article maps those terms onto Vietnamese Communist thinking through four specific cases. The declassified materials underscore the North Vietnamese leaders' deep commitment to a radical worldview and their occasional willingness to challenge Moscow and Beijing for leadership of world revolution. The article illuminates the connections (or lack thereof) between global, regional, and local politics and offers a more nuanced picture of how decolonization in Southeast Asia in the 1950s-1980s sparked not only a Cold War confrontation but also a regional war.

TI  - A comparison of remotely-sensed and inventory datasets for burned area in Mediterranean Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimate of observational uncertainty is an essential ingredient to correctly interpret changes in climatic and environmental variables such as wildfires. In this work we compare four state-of-the-art satellite fire products with the gridded, ground-based EFFIS dataset for Mediterranean Europe and analyse their statistical differences. The data are compared for spatial and temporal similarities at different aggregations to identify a spatial scale at which most of the observations provide equivalent results. The results of the analysis indicate that the datasets show high temporal correlation with each other (0.5/0.6) when aggregating the data at resolution of at least 1.0 degrees or at NUTS3 level. However, burned area estimates vary widely between datasets. Filtering out satellite fires located on urban and crop land cover classes greatly improves the agreement with EFFIS data. Finally, in spite of the differences found in the area estimates, the spatial pattern is similar for all the datasets, with spatial correlation increasing as the resolution decreases. Also, the general reasonable agreement between satellite products builds confidence in using these datasets and in particular the most-recent developed dataset, FireCCI51, shows the best agreement with EFFIS overall. As a result, the main conclusion of the study is that users should carefully consider the limitations of the satellite fire estimates currently available, as their uncertainties cannot be neglected in the overall uncertainty estimate/cascade that should accompany global or regional change studies and that removing fires on human-dominated land areas is key to analyze forest fires estimation from satellite products.

TI  - Sentinel-node biopsy in early-stage ovarian cancer: preliminary results of a prospective multicentre study (SELLY)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic paraaortic and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is the standard of a comprehensive surgical staging in presumed early epithelial ovarian cancer, but no prospective randomized evidence suggests a possible therapeutic value. Moreover, this procedure is associated with potential severe morbidity. The Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer trial is a prospective study designed to test whether sentinel node detection can accurately predict nodal status in a cohort of women with early epithelial ovarian cancer.OBJECTIVES: We here present the results of the first part of the Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer trial, regarding the feasibility of the sentinel lymph node technique and the preliminary findings regarding its safety and accuracy.STUDY DESIGN: The Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer trial is a prospective, phase II, single-arm study included patients with presumed stages I-II epithelial ovarian cancer planned for immediate or delayed minimally invasive comprehensive staging. The ovarian pedicle is injected with 2 mL of a 1.25 mg/mL indocyanine green solution. The pelvic and lumboaortic retroperitoneum is then accessed and inspected to identify and remove sentinel nodes. After sentinel node procedure, staging is completed including systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Assuming a sensitivity of 98.5% in predicting positive sentinel lymph nodes at histology, a pathological lymph node prevalence of 14.2%, a precision of estimate (ie, the maximum marginal error) d = 5%, a type I error a = 0.05, a sample size of 160 patients is needed to test the general hypothesis. Here we present the preliminary results on the first 31 patients enrolled.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included. Sentinel node was identified in 21 patients (detection rate, 67.7%). The detection rate was significantly higher in women undergoing immediate vs delayed staging (88.9% vs 41.7%, P = .003). Four patients had positive nodes. In all the patients with lymphatic dissemination, a positive sentinel node was identified (sensitivity, 100%; false-negative rate, 0%; negative predictive value, 100%). One (3.2%) intra- and 2 (6.5%) postoperative grade I complications occurred.CONCLUSION: Our data show that the detection of sentinel node in early epithelial ovarian cancer is low when patients are submitted to delayed-staging surgery. However, sentinel node procedure is feasible and has the potential to provide reliable and useful information on nodal status and may allow the avoidance of systematic lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Quantification of the Relationships between Land Use Land Cover Changes and Surface Temperature over the Lower Himalayan Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and population inflow from other regions has caused urbanization which altered land use land cover (LULC) in the lower Himalayan regions of Pakistan. This LULC change increased the land surface temperature (LST) in the region. LULC and LST changes were assessed for the period of 1990-2017 using Landsat data and the support vector machine (SVM) method. A combined cellular automata and artificial neural network (CA-ANN) prediction model was used for simulation of LULC changes for the period of 2032 and 2047 using transition potential matrix obtained from the data years of 2002 and 2017. The accuracy of the CA-ANN model was validated using simulated and classified images of 2017 with correctness value of 70% using validation modules in QGIS. The thermal bands of Landsat images from the years 1990, 2002 and 2017 were used for LST derivation. LST acquired for this period was then modeled for 2032 and 2047 using urban indices (UI) and linear regression analysis. The SVM land cover classification results showed a 5.75% and 4.22% increase in built-up area and bare soil respectively, while vegetation declined by 9.88% during 1990-2017. The results of LST for LULC classes showed that the built-up area had the highest mean LST as compared to other classes. The future projection of LULC and LST showed that the built-up area may increase by 12.48% and 14.65% in 2032 and 2047, respectively, of the total LULC area which was similar to 11% in 2017. Similarly, the area with temperature above 30 degrees C could be 44.01% and 58.02% in 2032 and 2047, respectively, of the total study area which was 18.64% in 2017. This study identified major challenges for urban planners to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. In order to address the UHI in the study area, an urban planner might focus on urban plantation and decentralization of urban areas.

TI  - Application of the GCOM-C global <i>ET<sub>index</sub></i> estimation algorithm in 40 forests located throughout Japan, North America, Australia, and the tropical region
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration estimates in forested areas are important not only for water resource management on a regional scale but also to better understand the water cycle on a global scale. The objective of this study was to evaluate the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) global Evapotranspiration-index (ETindex) estimation algorithm (GCOM-C ETindex algorithm) applied to forested areas. ETindex, which is the ratio of the actual evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration, is estimated from the actual surface temperature and hypothetical wet and dry surface temperatures, i.e., T-s (wet) and T-s (dry), respectively. Based on the algorithm, evapotranspiration is calculated from thermal satellite images and near-surface weather data. We compared the observed ground-based annual evapotranspiration with the estimated annual evapotranspiration obtained using the GCOM-C ETindex algorithm and thermal images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Sectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite for 40 forests, with 10 sites in four different areas, including Japan, North America, Australia, and the tropical region. We found that the GCOM-C ETindex algorithm well reproduced annual evapotranspiration for most forests. The root mean square errors (RMSE) for the 40 forests was 239 mm. In Japan, North America, and Australia, the overestimation of summer evapotranspiration was offset by the underestimation of winter evapotranspiration. The accuracy of annual evapotranspiration estimates in forests with low annual mean temperatures (<15 degrees C) was less than that in forests with high annual mean temperatures (>= 15 degrees C). Forests with a low annual mean temperature displayed low levels of evapotranspiration in winter. In these forests, the overestimation of summer evapotranspiration was not offset by the underestimation of winter evapotranspiration. The overestimation of T-s (wet) is the primary reason for the overestimation of summer evapotranspiration. Redetermination of the parameters for the T-s (wet) estimates must improve the evapotranspiration estimates in the forested areas, especially the ones with a low annual mean temperature.

TI  - THE LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION (LST) USING LANDSAT SCENES. CASE STUDY: THE INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM SAVINESTI
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - During the communism, the accent of development was put mainly on industry. This is also the case of The Industrial Platform Savinesti, from Neamt county, which assured two major productions: textile fibers and chemical fertilizers. After the fall of the regime, the platform was divised and some of the new owners have sold all the equipments, have demolished the buildings, leaving the place barren. In the present, only a few of the old factories still work, and new stakeholders started their businesses. The study aims to show how the land surface temperature (LST) evolved in association with the events that followed from the flowering period of the factory. Three summer months from different years (1991, 2008 and 2018) where taken into consideration and LST was calculated based on Landsat scenes from missions 5-TM and 8-OLI. In order to make the whole process faster, two models were constructed using ArcMap extesion Model Builder. Besides the land surface temperature, there were calculated another two indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), which offer additional arguments to the changes that took place on the platform. The purpose of the study is to show how land surface temperature changes depending on the use of the territory, thus the importance of remote sensing being emphasised.

TI  - Using Optical Water Types to Monitor Changes in Optically Complex Inland and Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency's Copernicus satellites Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 provide observations with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution which can be used to monitor inland and coastal waters. Such waters are optically complex, and the water color may vary from completely clear to dark brown. The main factors influencing water color are colored dissolved organic matter, phytoplankton, and suspended sediments. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of the optical water type (OWT) classification in the remote sensing of ocean color. Such classification helps to clarify relationships between different properties inside a certain class and quantify variation between classes. In this study, we present a new OWT classification based on the in situ measurements of reflectance spectra for boreal region lakes and coastal areas without extreme optical conditions. This classification divides waters into five OWT (Clear, Moderate, Turbid, Very Turbid, and Brown) and shows that different OWTs have different remote sensing reflectance spectra and that each OWT is associated with a specific bio-optical condition. Developed OWTs are distinguishable by both the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensors, and the accuracy of the OWT assignment was 95% for both the MSI and OLCI bands. To determine OWT from MSI images, we tested different atmospheric correction (AC) processors, namely ACOLITE, C2RCC, POLYMER, and Sen2Cor and for OLCI images, we tested AC processors ALTNNA, C2RCC, and L2. The C2RCC AC processor was the most accurate and reliable for use with MSI and OLCI images to estimate OWTs.

M3  - Historical Article
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to comprehensively disclose the meaning and relevance of the Salerno Health Code as a medieval source of medical and philosophical memo. In the process of writing a scientific article, the authors have used theoretical, empirical, and historical methods of scientific knowledge, in particular, methods of analysis, synthesis, deduction, comparison, the historical method, and the description method. In addition, the analysis of medical legislation, publications in the media and scientific periodicals, allowed us to study the essence and features of the Salerno Health Code. The article gives reason to a correspondence between the treatment methods proposed by the Salerno Health Code and the methods of modern medicine and the reflection of the basic standards of sanitary and epidemic well-being. The individual components of the Salerno Health Code were analyzed, which contributed to the development of bioethical views on sanitation, gerontology, dietetic, pharmaceuticals, disease prevention, medicine philosophy and more. The attention is focused on the author's approach to the formation of a positive worldview by a person and its relationship with the state of his physical health. The author symbolism of the poetic presentation of medical and philosophical ideas is analyzed. The treatise considers the author's approach to the formation of a positive worldview by a person and his relationship with his state of health. The article notes insufficient attention to the work of Arnold de Villanova in the scientific works of modern Ukrainian scientists in medicine and the humanities, which determines the relevance of further scientific research aimed at revealing the importance and potential of this source of medical and philosophical knowledge. Noted the relevance of certain parts of the Salerno Health Code for solving the problems of modern medical science.

TI  - JAXA Annual Forest Cover Maps for Vietnam during 2015-2018 Using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and Auxiliary Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the temporal changes of forests is important for sustainable forest management. In this study, we investigated the potential of using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for mapping annual change in forest cover at a national scale. We assessed the robustness of using multi-temporal Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2/Scanning Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2/ScanSAR) mosaic images for forest mapping by comparison with single-temporal PALSAR-2 mosaic images for three test sites in North, Central, and Southern Vietnam. We then used a combination of multi-temporal PALSAR-2/ScanSAR images, multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) images to map annual forest cover for mainland Vietnam during 2015-2018. Average overall accuracies of our forest/non-forest (FNF) maps (86.6% +/- 3.1%) were greater than recent maps of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA, (77.5% +/- 3.2%)) and European Space Agency (ESA, (85.4% +/- 1.6%)). Our estimates of mainland Vietnam's forest area were close to that of the Vietnamese government. A comparison of the spatial distribution of forest estimated from JAXA and ESA FNF maps showed that our FNF map in 2015 agreed relatively well with the ESA map, with 77% of pixels being consistent. This study demonstrates the merit of using multi-temporal PALSAR-2/ScanSAR images for annual forest mapping at a national scale.

TI  - Annual and seasonal variations in gross primary productivity across the agro-climatic regions in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a vital ecosystem variable that is used as a proxy to study the functional behaviour of a terrestrial ecosystem and its ability to regulate atmospheric CO2 by working as a carbon pool. India, having the potential terrestrial ecosystem dynamics to absorb the atmospheric carbon dioxide to some extent, is one of the least-explored regions in terms of carbon monitoring studies. The current study evaluates the applicability of a newly developed, quantum yield-based, remote sensing data-driven diagnostic model called the Southampton Carbon Flux (SCARF). This model was used to estimate the annual and seasonal variability of the terrestrial GPP over the Indian region with a spatial resolution of 1 km during 2008. This modified version of the conventional production efficiency model successfully predicted GPP using meteorological variables (PAR, air temperature and dew point temperature), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and quantum yield of C3 and C4 plants as the key input parameters. The annual GPP values were in the range from 0 to 4147.55 g C m(-2) year(-1), with a mean value of 1507.32 g C m(-2) year(-1). The maximum and minimum GPP were during the summer monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. The seasonal and annual distributions of GPP over the study area obtained using the SCARF model, and the MODIS GPP product (MOD17A2H) were similar. However, MODIS was found to underestimate the GPP in all regions and an overestimation in eastern Himalaya region. The study reveals that environmental scalars, specifically water stress, are the pivotal controlling variables responsible for the variation of GPP in India. The estimates of the GPP in different regions of the study area were made using SCARF, and an eddy covariance technique was similar. The SCARF model can be used to estimate GPP on a global scale. SCARF appears to be a better model in terms of the simplicity of the algorithm, performance and resolution. Thus, it may give higher accuracy in carbon monitoring studies.

TI  - A MODIS-based spatiotemporal assessment of agricultural residue burning in Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate characterization of the seasonal and inter-annual variability of agricultural residue burning in tropics is needed to devise strategies to control or minimize substantial amounts of particulate matter and pollutants released to the atmosphere through the burning of agricultural residues. The present study quantifies the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural residue burning in Madhya Pradesh, India. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data on the occurrence of fire over a period of 15 years (2002-2016) was used to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural residue burning in Central India. Overall, there was an increasing trend of fire occurrence, which increased from 1268 in 2002 to 7915 in 2016. Most of these fires were in croplands (48.1%) followed by deciduous broadleaf forests (36%). Cropland fires were increased almost 10-fold from 454 in 2002 to 4359 in 2016 at an average annual rate of 64%. The agricultural residue fires were high in Rabi harvesting period (March to May), as compared to that in Kharif harvesting period (October to December). The present study indicates an increased agricultural residue burning activity in the Madhya Pradesh and needs an immediate attention and develop sustainable alternative methods for crop residue management. The present study also suggests that Modis can be used for long-term assessment of small fires. We recommend ploughing of agricultural residues into the soil as a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to the burning of crop residues.

TI  - Profile of tuberculosis mortality in Brazil, 2001-2011
T2  - REVISTA DE EPIDEMIOLOGIA E CONTROLE DE INFECCAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: In the health-disease process of tuberculosis (TB), mortality is one of the health indicators that most reflects the social link with the biological aspect. Death from TB is a sentinel event because it is preventable and indicates a failure of the social network and the health system. Objectives: To describe the sociodemographic and operational characteristics of patients who died of TB and the temporal distribution of the TB mortality rate in Brazil. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative study performed from the database of the Mortality Information System (Portuguese acronym: SIM), in which all deaths with TB as the main cause registered from 2001 to 2011 were considered. Data analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results: During the study period, 53,747 deaths were recorded with TB as the basic cause. There was a higher percentage of cases of male sex (n = 39,597; 73.6%), mixed race (n=21,697; 40.3%), single marital status (n=23,518; 43.8%), schooling of up to eight years (n=19,443; 36.2%). A higher number of deaths occurred at the hospital (n=43,028; 80.1%) and 19,712 cases (36.7%) received medical assistance before death. The annual crude mortality rate decreased during the study period, ranging from 3.2 to 2.4 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants. Conclusion: The results show the need for strategies differentiated by sex, age and education at the local level in TB control programs, as well as for planning health promotion and prevention actions available to populations living in these areas.

TI  - The Case for a Single Channel Composite Arctic Sea Surface Temperature Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperatures derived from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) data are critical inputs for assessing climate change in polar environments. Sea and ice surface temperature (SST, IST) are commonly determined with split window algorithms that use the brightness temperature from the 11 mu m channel (BT11) as the main estimator and the difference between BT11 and the 12 mu m channel (BTD11-12) to correct for atmospheric water vapor absorption. An issue with this paradigm in the Arctic maritime environment is the occurrence of high BTD11-12 that is not indicative of atmospheric absorption of BT11 energy. The Composite Arctic Sea Surface Temperature Algorithm (CASSTA) considers three regimes based on BT11 pixel value: seawater, ice, and marginal ice zones. A single channel (BT11) estimator is used for SST and a split window algorithm for IST. Marginal ice zone temperature is determined with a weighted average between the SST and IST. This study replaces the CASSTA split window IST with a single channel (BT11) estimator to reduce errors associated with BTD11-12 in the split window algorithm. The single channel IST returned improved results in the CASSTA dataset with a mean average error for ice and marginal ice zones of 0.142 K and 0.128 K, respectively.

TI  - Outcome of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stages quamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity with methylene blue dye alone: a prospective validation study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility and role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using methylene blue dye alone in identifying occult lymph node metastases in early oral cancer (cT1, T2, and cN0). The study was done from 2013-15 in 94 patients in a large cancer centre. The blue nodes were dissected and sent for frozen section, routine histopathological examination, and immunohistochemical testing for cytokeratin, and was followed by elective neck dissection in all patients. The identification rate was 93.61%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy for frozen section and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were 84.6%, 100%, 100%, 93.9% and 95.5%, respectively. Occult lymph node metastasis was seen in 27.6% cases. Biopsy of SLN with blue dye alone might be used successfully with good sensitivity and negative predictive value in countries with limited resources in the developing world. Immunohistochemistry contributes to it by increasing the sensitivity and NPV, and thereby improves the diagnostic value.

TI  - The Application of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging During Robotic Liver Resection: A Case-Matched Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The ICG fluorescence properties are progressively gaining momentum in the HPB surgery. However, the exact impact of ICG application on surgical outcomes is yet to be established. Methods Twenty-five patients who underwent ICG fluorescence-guided robotic liver resection were case-matched in a 1:1 ratio to a cohort who underwent standard robotic liver resection. Results In the ICG group, six additional lesions not diagnosed by preoperative workup and intraoperative ultrasound were identified and resected. Four of the lesions were proved to be malignant. Despite the similar operative time (288 vs. 272 min, p = 0.778), the risk of postoperative bile leakage (0% vs. 12%, p = 0.023), R1 resection (0% vs. 16%, p = 0.019) and readmission (p = 0.023) was reduced in the ICG group compared with the no-ICG group. Conclusions The ICG fluorescence is a real-time navigation tool which enables surgeons to enhance visualization of anatomical structures and overcome the disadvantages of minimally invasive liver resection. The procedure is not time-consuming, and its applications can reduce the postoperative complication rate in robotic liver surgery.

TI  - Mapping Annual Urban Change Using Time Series Landsat and NLCD
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual urban change information is important for an improved understanding of urban dynamics and continuous modeling of urban ecosystem processes. This study examined Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for characterizing annual urban change. To reduce impacts from cloud contamination and missing data, United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat Analysis Ready Data were processed to derive annual NDVI layers using a maximum value composite algorithm. National Land Cover Database land cover products from 2001 and 2011 were used as references for generating a decadal urban change mask. Within the decadal urban change mask and using annual NDVI as input, we examined three time-series change detection methods to pinpoint specific year of urban change: (a) minimum-value method, (b) break-point detection, and (c) simple-threshold identification. For accuracy assessment, we divided change pixels into urbanization and urban-intensification pixel groups, defined by initial land cover types. We used Google Earth's High-Resolution Imagery Archive as primary reference data for detailed accuracy assessment. Overall, the urbanization pixel group has good change detection accuracies of above 82% for all three change detection algorithms. The break-point detection method resulted in the highest overall accuracy of 88%. Overall accuracies for urban intensification pixel group were in the range of 35%-76%, depending on choice of change detection algorithm, length of input time-series, and further division of pixel subgroups.

TI  - Quantifying Trends of Land Change in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during 2001-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is among the most sensitive ecosystems to changes in global climate and human activities, and quantifying its consequent change in land-cover land-use (LCLU) is vital for assessing the responses and feedbacks of alpine ecosystems to global climate changes. In this study, we first classified annual LCLU maps from 2001-2015 in QTP from MODIS satellite images, then analyzed the patterns of regional hotspots with significant land changes across QTP, and finally, associated these trends in land change with climate forcing and human activities. The pattern of land changes suggested that forests and closed shrublands experienced substantial expansions in the southeastern mountainous region during 2001-2015 with the expansion of massive meadow loss. Agricultural land abandonment and the conversion by conservation policies existed in QTP, and the newly-reclaimed agricultural land partially offset the loss with the resulting net change of -5.1%. Although the urban area only expanded 586 km(2), mainly at the expense of agricultural land, its rate of change was the largest (41.2%). Surface water exhibited a large expansion of 5866 km(2) (10.2%) in the endorheic basins, while mountain glaciers retreated 8894 km(2) (-3.4%) mainly in the southern and southeastern QTP. Warming and the implementation of conservation policies might promote the shrub encroachment into grasslands and forest recovery in the southeastern plateau. While increased precipitation might contribute to the expansion of surface water in the endorheic basins, warming melts the glaciers in the south and southeast and complicates the hydrological service in the region. The substantial changes in land-cover reveal the high sensitivity of QTP to changes in climate and human activities. Rational policies for conservation might mitigate the adverse impacts to maintain essential services provided by the important alpine ecosystems.

TI  - Emergency Response Using Volunteered Passenger Aircraft Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study on Flood Damage Mapping
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current satellite remote sensing data still have some inevitable defects, such as a low observing frequency, high cost and dense cloud cover, which limit the rapid response to ground changes and many potential applications. However, passenger aircraft may be an alternative remote sensing platform in emergency response due to the high revisit rate, dense coverage and low cost. This paper introduces a volunteered passenger aircraft remote sensing method (VPARS) for emergency response. It uses the images captured by the passenger volunteers during flight. Based on computer vision algorithms and geocoding procedures, these images can be processed into a mosaic orthoimage for rapid ground disaster mapping. Notable, due to the relatively low flight latitude, small clouds can be easily removed by stacking multi-angle tilt images in the VPARS method. A case study on the 2019 Guangdong flood monitoring validates these advantages. The frequent aircraft revisit time, intensive flight coverage, multi-angle images and low cost of the VPARS make it a potential way to complement traditional remote sensing methods in emergency response.

TI  - Snow-Covered Area Retrieval from Himawari-8 AHI Imagery of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily snow-covered area retrieval using the imagery in solar reflective bands often encounters extensive data gaps caused by cloud obscuration. With the inception of geostationary satellites carrying advanced multispectral imagers of high temporal resolution, such as Japan's geostationary weather satellite Himawari-8, considerable progress can now be made towards spatially-complete estimation of daily snow-covered area. We developed a dynamic snow index (normalized difference snow index for vegetation-free background and normalized difference forest-snow index for vegetation background) fractional snow cover estimation method using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) observations of the Tibetan Plateau. This method estimates fractional snow cover with the pixel-by-pixel linear relationship of snow index observations acquired under snow-free and snow-covered conditions. To achieve reliable snow-covered area mapping with minimal cloud contamination, the daily fractional snow cover can be represented as the composite of the high temporal resolution fractional snow cover estimates during daytime. The comparison against reference fractional snow cover data from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the Himawari-8 AHI fractional snow cover ranged from 0.07 to 0.16, and that the coefficient of determination (R-2) reached 0.81-0.96. Results from the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 winters indicated that the daily composite of Himawari-8 observations obtained a 14% cloud percentage over the Tibetan Plateau, which was less than the cloud percentage (27%) from the combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua.

TI  - Estimation of the surface heat transfer coefficient over the east-central Tibetan Plateau using satellite remote sensing and field observation data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The bulk transfer method is commonly used to calculate the surface sensible heat (SSH) flux in climatology and in the numerical model, but in the calculation, the value of the bulk transfer coefficient for heat (C-h) is generally regarded as a fixed value (e.g., 0.004 in the Tibetan Plateau), without considering its seasonal variations and regional differences. In this study, a new method for upscaling data from the local to regional scale is proposed and tested to estimate C-h over the east-central Tibetan Plateau (TP) using the latest version Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset, and micrometeorological observations collected at four field sites. Results suggest that the proposed method is capable of reflecting the variations in C-h at the regional scale in a climatic context. It is a relatively reliable way of estimating the value of C-h using satellite remote sensing data and field observations. Then, the monthly values of C-h and the SSH flux at 70 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations on the east-central TP during the period 1982-2012 are estimated. Results show that the value of C-h ranges from 0.0025-0.0050, with obvious seasonal variations and spatial differences. Because the surface vegetation coverage in the southeastern part of the TP is better than that in the north-central part, the values of C-h are higher than that in the north-central part of the TP throughout the year. The SSH flux also shows obvious seasonal variations and spatial differences, which is strongest in spring, followed by summer and autumn, and smallest in winter. Furthermore, the seasonal mean SSH has undergone a significant interdecadal transition in the early 2000s, from the previous weakening trend to the strengthening trend. Based on the results of this study, the values of C-h obtained from a limited number of local field observations on the plateau can be applied to more CMA stations at the regional scale. Such a method can improve the calculation accuracy of the SSH flux over the TP and aid studies of plateau meteorology and climatology.

TI  - Time-Series Analysis Reveals Intensified Urban Heat Island Effects but without Significant Urban Warming
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have shown an increased surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) in many cities with urban expansion. Few studies, however, have investigated whether such intensification is mainly caused by urban warming, the cooling of surrounding nonurban regions, or the different rates of warming/cooling between urban and nonurban areas. This study aims to fill that gap using Beijing, China, as a case study. We first examined the temporal trends of SUHII in Beijing and then compared the magnitude of the land surface temperature (LST) trend in urban and nonurban areas. We further detected the temporal trend of LST (Trend(LST)) at the pixel level and explored its linkage to the temporal trends of EVI (Trend(EVI)) and NDBI (Trend(NDBI)). We used MODIS data from 2000 to 2015. We found that (1) SUHII significantly increased from 4.35 degrees C to 6.02 degrees C, showing an intensified surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, with an annual increase rate of 0.13 degrees C in summer during the daytime and 0.04 degrees C in summer at night. In addition, the intensification of SUHII was more prominent in new urban areas (NUA). (2) The intensified SUHII, however, was largely caused by substantial cooling effects in nonurban areas (NoUA), not substantial warming in urban areas. (3) Spatially, there were large spatial variations in significant warming and cooling spots over the entire study area, which were related to Trend(NDBI) and Trend(EVI). Trend(NDBI) significantly affected Trend(LST) in a positive way, while the Trend(EVI) had a significant positive effect (p = 0.023) on Trend(LST) only when EVI had an increasing trend. Our study underscores the importance of quantifying and comparing the changes in LST in both urban and nonurban areas when investigating changes in SUHII using time-series trend analysis. Such analysis can provide insights into promoting city-based urban heat mitigation strategies which focused on both urban and nonurban areas.

TI  - Field-Scale Rice Yield Estimation Using Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data in Coastal Saline Region of Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a large number of salterns have been converted into rice fields in the coastal region of Jiangsu Province, Eastern China. The high spatial heterogeneity of soil salinity has caused large within-field variabilities in grain yield of rice. The identification of low-yield areas within a field is an important initial step for precision farming. While optical satellite remote sensing can provide valuable information on crop growth and yield potential, the availability of cloud-free optical image data is often hampered by unfavorable weather conditions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers an alternative due to its nearly day-and-night and all-weather capability in data acquisition. Given the free data access of the Sentinels, this study aimed at developing a Sentinel-1A-based SAR index for rice yield estimation. The proposed SAR simple difference (SSD) index uses the change of the Sentinel-1A backscatter in vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization between the end of the tillering stage and the end of grain filling stage (SSDVH). A strong exponential relationship has been identified between the SSDVH and rice yield, producing accurate yield estimation with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.74 t ha(-1) and a relative error (RE) of 7.93%.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characterization of the urban sprawl and its impacts on urban island in China with DMSP/OLS and MODIS measurements
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of cities has led to the urban sprawl to the suburbs. Studies have shown that urban sprawl leads to the increasing intensity of heat island effect. This paper, based on the DMSP/OLS nighttime light data and the MODIS land surface temperature data during the years 2000, 2005, and 2013, discussed the spatial and temporal characteristics of urban sprawl, urban heat island intensity in China, and their relationship, respectively. The results show that (1) the national urban expansion index showed an upward trend. The urban area was 104,000 km(2) in 2000, 169,000 km(2) in 2005, and 312,000 km(2) in 2013.The average annual growth rate was 10.2% in 2000-2005, 8% in 2000-2013, and 8.8% in 2000-2013. (2) The national heat island index also showed an upward trend; total heat island intensity was 716.73 degrees C in 2000, 812.84 degrees C in 2005, and 995.46 degrees C in 2013. The annual average growth rate was 2.55% in 2000-2005, 2.57% in 2005-2013, and 2.56% in 2000-2013. (3) There is a positive correlation between urban spatial expansion and heat island intensity in China. The urban and suburban range of China can be objectively extracted from the DMSP/OLS nighttime light data every year and superimposed with the MODIS land surface temperature data of the same period, which ensures the correctness of the urban heat island intensity based on the actual changes of suburban areas and main urban areas in each city, and overcomes the calculation error of the traditional method, which neglects that some suburbs have become urban areas and are still regarded as suburbs. These results provide spatiotemporal changes characterization of urban area in China during recent decades, which are helpful in decision-making of land management and planning for sustainable development.

TI  - Comparison and Assessment of Regional and Global Land Cover Datasets for Use in CLASS over Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land cover information is required to initialize land surface and Earth system models. In recent years, new land cover (LC) datasets at finer spatial resolutions have become available while those currently implemented in most models are outdated. This study assesses the applicability of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) LC product for use in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) through comparison with finer resolution datasets over Canada, assisted with reference sample data and a vegetation continuous field tree cover fraction dataset. The results show that in comparison with the finer resolution maps over Canada, the 300 m CCI product provides much improved LC distribution over that from the 1 km GLC2000 dataset currently used to provide initial surface conditions in CLASS. However, the CCI dataset appears to overestimate needleleaf forest cover especially in the taiga-tundra transition zone of northwestern Canada. This may have partly resulted from limited availability of clear sky MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images used to generate the CCI classification maps due to the long snow cover season in Canada. In addition, changes based on the CCI time series are not always consistent with those from the MODIS or a Landsat-based forest cover change dataset, especially prior to 2003 when only coarse spatial resolution satellite data were available for change detection in the CCI product. It will be helpful for application in global simulations to determine whether these results also apply to other regions with similar landscapes, such as Eurasia. Nevertheless, the detailed LC classes and finer spatial resolution in the CCI dataset provide an improved reference map for use in land surface models in Canada. The results also suggest that uncertainties in the current cross-walking tables are a major source of the often large differences in the plant functional types (PFT) maps, and should be an area of focus in future work.

TI  - Parameters determination and sensor correction method based on virtual CMOS with distortion for the GaoFen6 WFV camera
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen6 (GF6) satellite is an optical remote sensing satellite in China's GaoFen series that combines the imaging abilities of high resolution and wide field of view (WFV). The WFV camera, equipped on the GF6, can obtain an image 800 km in width and with a resolution of 16 m, which represents the highest level of observation swath width among similar satellites in the world. Guaranteeing the high geometric quality of the imagery obtained by the WFV camera for subsequent remote sensing applications is a prominent problem that must be solved. This paper presents the key geometry processing method for the WFV camera, in which the parameters relative determination method based on two selected reference bands and the sensor correction based on virtual collinear complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with distortion are proposed. To overcome the challenge of matching the tie points between different bands with large radiation differences, two bands-rather than traditional one band-were chosen as the reference bands for the WFV camera to perform the parameters relative determination. The geometric influence of the virtual CMOS is fully analyzed in the along- and across-track directions. Then, the virtual CMOS with a real calibrated distortion was designed; based on this design, a sensor correction was applied to stitch the whole image generated by single images in each band. This experiment verified the effectiveness of the proposed parameters relative determination and sensor correction methods in improving the internal relative accuracy and the registration accuracy; moreover, the mosaicking accuracy is also guaranteed.

TI  - Analysis of polarisation features of typical targets in Chengdu using GF-3 fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - The fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data contain much backscatter intensity information and have great advantage for land monitoring. Analysing the polarisation features of typical targets is a critical step for landing monitoring, especially the ground objects identification, and thus accurately obtaining and analysing the polarisation features is of importance. Gaofen-3(GF-3) is the first C band fully polarimetric SAR satellite in China, which is widely used in various fields such as land monitoring, disaster reduction and so on. Here, the GF-3 fully polarimetric SAR data at three time-slices were used to obtain and analyse the polarisation features of typical targets in Chengdu. The results revealed the scattering type of the typical targets including artificial buildings and vegetation and indicated that the GF-3 SAR data were suitable to be used for obtaining polarisation features of typical targets and have the potential for discriminate artificial building and further for landing monitoring.

TI  - Ovarian cancer metastasis to the breast 18 years after the initial diagnosis A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Ovarian cancer often metastasizes, but it is unusual to transfer to the breast as an isolated mass. In particular, it is rare for patients to have breast metastases after 18 years of diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Therefore, accurate identification of ovarian cancer mammary gland metastasis can contribute to the treatment of the disease. Patient concerns: This case report shows that an 82-year-old woman was diagnosed with breast metastases from ovarian cancer diagnosed 18 years ago. The patient underwent total uterine attachment, omentum, pelvic lymphadenectomy, pelvic floor tumor reduction, and chemotherapy 18 years ago. Diagnosis: The pathological examination revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining results were negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal receptor-2 (Her-2), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1); and positive for cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK7, and CA125. Interventions: The patient underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy because of breast mass in November, 2018. Outcomes: Currently, she has been followed for more than 1 month without any signs of recurrence. Lessons: Breast metastatic tumors should be distinguished from primary breast tumors to avoid any unnecessary surgery. The correct diagnosis is very important: surgical treatment of patients with secondary breast cancer may be diagnostic and palliative.

TI  - Punishing the Immoral Other: Penal Substitutionary Logic in the War on Drugs
T2  - PASTORAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article contends that penal substitutionary atonement, and its necessary connection between sin, wrath, and punishment, influences the political discourse and practices around America's wars on drugs. In this work, the author is guided by Ryan LaMothe's proposals for pastoral political theology. She suggests that his initial question of "what's going on" in the political realm could include surfacing theology's influence upon political discourses and practices. The author begins by reviewing the history of assigning a spoiled moral identity to marginalized groups through America's wars on drugs. She pays special attention to the current conflation of immigration and drug rhetoric targeting Hispanics. She then considers penal atonement theory and its connection to punitive justice. The author suggests three aspects of the worldview surrounding this theory that motivate a distinct lack of care for those who commit acts deemed immoral: (1) no mercy outside of punishment, (2) pain is essential to justice, and (3) the law is implacable to commonsense reasoning. The necessity of punishment, including the animus of God's personal wrath against the sinner for affronting God's holiness, smooths the way for "tough on crime" stances against those stigmatized as morally corrupt. The apparent commonsense connection between sin and punishment hampers responses to drug selling or using that could engage alternative forms of care and justice.

TI  - Global 500 m clumping index product derived from MODIS BRDF data (2001-2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation clumping index (CI) quantifies the degree to which foliage deviates from a random distribution, and therefore, is an important canopy structural parameter that governs the photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes in terrestrial ecosystems. While the temporal variation of CI has been investigated in many field studies, there has not been a global CI product that captured its seasonal and inter-annual variations. In this study, a look-up table (LUT) method was developed based on an improved Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) method to estimate the daily CI from the MODIS V006 MCD43 BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) product. This new CI product is consistent with field measurements at 33 sites distributed globally (R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.04, and bias = -0.01). CI shows stronger seasonal variations for deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) and mixed forests than other vegetation types. The large seasonal differences between evergreen and deciduous vegetation, especially for DBF and deciduous shrubs, allow the CI to be used to detect seasonal structural changes and classify vegetation. The global CI shows a negative correlation to the leaf area index (LAI) for all land cover types, especially forests. The global CI demonstrates an inter annual variation that correlated with global precipitation (R-2 = 0.34). In addition, the global CI shows a global decreasing trend from 2001 to 2017 (-0.007/decade) that was consistent with the increasing LAI (0.049/decade). The time series of CI provides a new perspective for understanding the structural characteristics of vegetation in global ecosystem studies.

TI  - Estimation of <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>(PAR) in inland waters across China in relation to the light absorption of optically active components
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The comprehensive analysis of the relationships between the attenuation of photosynthetic active radiation (K-d(PAR)) and light absorption is an imperative requirement to retrieve K-d(PAR) from remote sensing data for aquatic environments. The spatial distributions of the K-d(PAR) and light absorption of optically active components (a(OACs)) were routinely estimated in China lakes and reservoirs. Spatial K-d(PAR) was relatively dependent on the inorganic particles (average relative contribution of 57.95%). The a(OACs) could explain 70-87% of K-d(PAR) variations. A linear model is used to predict K-d(PAR), as a function of light absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a(phy)), colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)), and inorganic particles (a(NAP)): K-d(PAR) = 0.41 + 0.57 x a(CDOM) + 0.96 x a(NAP) + 0.57 x a(phy) (R-2 = 0.87, n = 741, p < 0.001). In the lakes with low TSM concentration and non-eutrophic lakes with high TSM, a(CDOM) was the most powerful predicting factor on K-d(PAR). In eutrophic lakes with high TSM, a(NAP) had the most significant impact on K-d(PAR). This study allowed K-d(PAR) to be predicted from a(OACs) values in the inland waters.

TI  - Can Data Assimilation of Surface PM2.5 and Satellite AOD Improve WRF-Chem Forecasting? A Case Study for Two Scenarios of Particulate Air Pollution Episodes in Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model and Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) assimilation tool, a forecasting system was used for two selected episodes (winter and summer) over Eastern Europe. During the winter episode, very high particular matter (PM2.5, diameter less than 2.5 mu m) concentrations, related to low air temperatures and increased emission from residential heating, were measured at many stations in Poland. During the summer episode, elevated aerosol optical depth (AOD), likely related to the transport of pollution from biomass fires, was observed in Southern Poland. Our aim is to verify if there is a relevant positive impact of surface and satellite data assimilation (DA) on modeled PM2.5 concentrations, and to assess whether there are significant differences in the DA's impact on concentrations between the two seasons. The results show a significant difference in the impact of surface and satellite DA on the model results between the summer and winter episode, which to a large degree is related to the availability of the satellite data. For example, the application of satellite DA raises the factor of two statistic from 0.18 to 0.78 for the summer episode, whereas this statistic remains unchanged (0.71) for the winter. The study suggests that severe winter air pollution episodes in Poland and Eastern Europe in general, often related to the dense cover of low clouds, will benefit from the assimilation of surface observations rather than satellite data, which can be very sparse in such meteorological situations. In contrast, the assimilation of satellite data can have a greater positive impact on the model results during summer than the assimilation of surface data for the same period.

TI  - Remote sensing for drought monitoring & impact assessment: Progress, past challenges and future opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a common hydrometeorological phenomenon and a pervasive global hazard. As our climate changes, it is likely that drought events will become more intense and frequent. Effective drought monitoring is therefore critical, both to the research community in developing an understanding of drought, and to those responsible for drought management and mitigation. Over the past 50 years remote sensing has shifted the field away from reliance on traditional site-based measurements and enabled observations and estimates of key drought-related variables over larger spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible. This has proven especially important in data poor regions with limited in-situ monitoring stations. Available remotely sensed data products now represent almost all aspects of drought propagation and have contributed to our understanding of the phenomena. In this review we chart the rise of remote sensing for drought monitoring, examining key milestones and technologies for assessing meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought events. We reflect on challenges the research community has faced to date, such as limitations associated with data record length and spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. This review then looks ahead to the future in terms of new technologies, such as the ESA Sentinel satellites, analytical platforms and approaches, such as Google EarthEngine, and the utility of existing data in new drought monitoring applications. We look forward to the continuation of 50 years of progress to provide effective, innovative and efficient drought monitoring solutions utilising remote sensing technology.

TI  - Sex Differences in Veterans' Cardiovascular Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the U.S. civilian population, sex differences have been identified in cardiovascular health; these differences have been used to inform care. Our objective is to determine if the same sex differences are present in Veterans who use the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System given the additional stressors associated with military service. Materials and Methods: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and conditions among women and men Veterans using VA in fiscal year (FY) 2014 were identified through the presence of International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes in VA administrative records. ICD-9-CM codes were grouped into conditions; prevalence was examined by gender overall, by age, and by race/ethnicity. Results: Within the FY 2014 cohort of VA Veteran patients included in this analysis, 7.1% (n = 412,901) were women and 92.9% were men (n = 5,376,749). Compared with men, women in this cohort were younger and more ethnically diverse. Overall, women were less likely to have traditional CVD risk factors, but more likely to have a nontraditional CVD risk factor (depression) compared with men. Women had higher odds of chest pain/angina (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.03, confidence interval [95% CI] 1.02-1.05), palpitations (AOR 2.04; 95% CI 1.98-2.10), and valvular disease (AOR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.08), but lower odds of coronary artery disease (AOR 0.29; 95% CI 0.29-0.30), acute MI (AOR 0.46; 95% CI 0.43-0.49), and heart failure (AOR 0.55; 95% CI 0.53-0.56) compared with men, overall. Conclusions: In age-adjusted comparisons, sex differences in the prevalence of CVD risk factors and conditions among the VA Veteran patient population was similar in that seen in the civilian population with a few exceptions.

TI  - A Modular Processing Chain for Automated Flood Monitoring from Multi-Spectral Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergency responders frequently request satellite-based crisis information for flood monitoring to target the often-limited resources and to prioritize response actions throughout a disaster situation. We present a generic processing chain that covers all modules required for operational flood monitoring from multi-spectral satellite data. This includes data search, ingestion and preparation, water segmentation and mapping of flooded areas. Segmentation of the water extent is done by a convolutional neural network that has been trained on a global dataset of Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI and Sentinel-2 images. Clouds, cloud shadows and snow/ice are specifically handled by the network to remove potential biases from downstream analysis. Compared to previous work in this direction, the method does not require atmospheric correction or post-processing and does not rely on ancillary data. Our method achieves an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 0.93, Kappa of 0.87 and Dice coefficient of 0.90. It outperforms a widely used Random Forest classifier and a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) threshold method. We introduce an adaptable reference water mask that is derived by time-series analysis of archive imagery to distinguish flood from permanent water. When tested against manually produced rapid mapping products for three flood disasters (Germany 2013, China 2016 and Peru 2017), the method achieves >= 0.92 OA, >= 0.86 Kappa and >= 0.90 Dice coefficient. Furthermore, we present a flood monitoring application centred on Bihar, India. The processing chain produces very high OA (0.94), Kappa (0.92) and Dice coefficient (0.97) and shows consistent performance throughout a monitoring period of one year that involves 19 Landsat OLI (<mml:semantics>mu Kappa=0.92</mml:semantics> and <mml:semantics>sigma Kappa=0.07</mml:semantics>) and 61 Sentinel-2 images (<mml:semantics>mu Kappa=0.92</mml:semantics>, <mml:semantics>sigma Kappa=0.05</mml:semantics>). Moreover, we show that the mean effective revisit period (considering cloud cover) can be improved significantly by multi-sensor combination (three days with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat OLI).

TI  - Anticoagulant rodenticides in <i>Strix</i> owls indicate widespread exposure in west coast forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure of nontarget wildlife to anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) is a global conservation concern typically centered around urban or agricultural areas. Recently, however, the illegal use of ARs in remote forests of California, USA, has exposed sensitive predators, including the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). We used congeneric barred owls (S. varia) as a sentinel species to investigate whether ARs pose a threat to spotted owls and other old-forest wildlife in northern regions of the Pacific Northwest. We analyzed the liver tissue from 40 barred owls collected in Oregon and Washington and confirmed exposure to >= 1 AR compounds in 48% of the owls examined. Brodifacoum, an extremely toxic second-generation AR, was the most common compound detected (89% of positive cases), followed by bromadiolone (11%), difethialone (11%), and warfarin (5%). Brodifacoum was also detected in one barred owl and one spotted owl opportunistically found dead (liver concentrations were 0.091 and 0.049 mu g/g, respectively). We found no evidence that exposure varied with proximity to developed and agricultural areas, or among different study areas, age-classes, and sexes. Rather, exposure was ubiquitous, and the rates we observed in our study (38-64%) were similar to or greater than that reported previously for barred owls in California (40%). Together these studies indicate widespread contamination in forested landscapes used by spotted owls and other wildlife of conservation concern. Owls collected in older forests may have been exposed via illegal use of ARs, highlighting a mounting challenge for land managers and policy makers.

TI  - On the Applicability of Laboratory Thermal Infrared Emissivity Spectra for Deconvolving Satellite Data of Opaque Volcanic Ash Plumes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ASTER Volcanic Ash Library (AVAL) is presented, developed using quantitative laboratory thermal infrared (TIR) emission spectroscopic methods, spanning the 2000-400 cm(-1) (5-25 mu m wavelength) range, including the Earth's TIR atmospheric window (8-12 mu m). Each spectral suite is unique owing to the chemical composition and proportion of glass to crystals per sample and is divided into six size fractions. AVAL, used with an appropriate spectral mixture model applied to orbital multispectral TIR data, provides a unique ability to study active volcanic ash plumes. We present the first example of this application to an ash plume produced by the Sakurajima Volcano in Japan. The emissivity variations measured in ash plumes using an ever-expanding ash spectral library will provide future quantitative inputs for both atmospheric models, where the ash composition is unknown or estimated, as well as compositional probes into ongoing eruptions.

TI  - Risk factors for lymph nodes involvement in obese women with endometrial carcinomas
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To assess risk factors for lymph node involvement in patients with endometrial cancer and a body-mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2).Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis was performed of obese patients diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma between 2007 and 2015, treated in a single center in Montreal. Preoperative variables evaluated were age, BMI, parity, and preoperative ASA score, grade, CA-125 and histology. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models.Results. The study included 230 women with BMI >= 30, 223 (97.0%) had complete staging. Pelvic lymph node involvement was detected in 26 patients (11.3%). Sentinel node detection and pelvic lymph node dissection decreased with increasing BMI (adjusted OR 0.86, 95%CI 0.76-0.97 and 0.76, 95%CI 0.59-0.96, respectively, per 1 kg/m(2) increment). Pelvic lymph node involvement was inversely correlated with BMI (adjusted OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.99) and present in 16/85 (18.8%), 6/56 (10.7%), and 4/82 (4.9%) of patients with a BMI of 30.0-34.9, 35.0-39.9, and >= 40.0 kg/m(2), respectively. Preoperative CA-125 was associated with lymph node involvement (adjusted OR 2.77, 95%CI 1.62-4.73, per quartile increment).Conclusion. Pelvic lymph node dissection might be omitted in selected cases of morbidly obese patients with failed sentinel nodes mapping and a low CA-125. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Background The feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) disease who convert to clinically node-negative (cN0) disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been evaluated in several large clinical trials, but it remains unclear whether the approach has been broadly adopted in the United States. Methods The National Cancer Database was used to identify women diagnosed with cN+ breast cancer who received NAC followed by surgery between 2012 and 2015. Trends in axillary surgery were evaluated and multivariable logistic regression analyses performed to determine factors associated with receipt of SLNB. Results Of 12,965 women cN+ at baseline, the use of SLNB increased from 31.8% in 2012 to 49% in 2015 (p < 0.001). Using axillary pCR as a surrogate for patients who convert to cN0 following NAC, among 5127 (39.5%) ypN0 patients, SLNB increased from 38.2 to 58.4% over the study period (p < 0.001), resulting in avoidance of axillary dissection in 42.2% of ypN0 patients by 2015. In adjusted analyses, factors significantly associated with SLNB attempt included cN1 disease, age < 45 years, treatment facility type, triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes, and year of diagnosis. In women with residual isolated tumor cells (ITCs), micrometastases, and ypN1 disease, SLNB was the only axillary procedure performed in 36.9%, 23.6%, and 13.0% of cases. Conclusions The use of SLNB in cN+ patients receiving NAC increased significantly between 2012 and 2015. SLNB alone was performed in more than 10% of patients with ypN1 disease, 20% with micrometastases, and 35% with ITCs; the oncologic safety of omitting axillary dissection in these patients requires further evaluation.

TI  - Parallel K-Tree: A multicore, multinode solution to extreme clustering
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clustering is a popular technique that can help make large datasets more manageable and usable by grouping together similar objects. Most clustering approaches are too computationally expensive for datasets that are very large or complex. This work presents Parallel K-Tree, a hierarchical data structure and clustering algorithm that takes advantage of modern computing environments to cluster extremely large datasets. Parallel K-Tree produces high-quality clusters and scales more efficiently than traditional, parallelized and state-of-the-art approaches. Parallel K-Tree was applied to a large (8 terabyte) collection of Landsat 5 satellite images. This required clustering of 540 billion objects into eight billion clusters - a two orders of magnitude size increase over any reported alternative approach. Furthermore, Parallel K-Tree was executed on just two commodity servers - rather than a high-performance supercomputer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of AOD Correction and Spatial Scale on the Correlation between High-Resolution AOD from Gaofen-1 Satellite and In Situ PM<sub>2.5</sub> Measurements in Shenzhen City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is widely used to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations. Most AOD products have relatively low spatial resolutions (i.e., >= 1 km). Consequently, insufficient research exists on the relationship between high-resolution (i.e., <1 km) AOD and PM2.5 concentrations. Taking Shenzhen City, China as the study area, we derived AOD at the 16-m spatial resolution for the period 2015-2017 based on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite images and the Dark Target (DT) algorithm. Then, we extracted AOD at spatial scales ranging from 40 m to 5000 m and applied vertical and humidity corrections. We analyzed the correlation between AOD and PM2.5 concentrations, and the impacts of AOD correction and spatial scale on the correlation. It was found that the DT-derived GF-1 AOD at different spatial scales had statistically significant correlations with surface PM2.5 concentrations, and the AOD corrections strengthened the correlations. The correlation coefficients (R) between AOD at different spatial scales and PM2.5 concentrations were 0.234-0.329 and 0.340-0.423 before and after AOD corrections, respectively. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, PM2.5 concentrations had the best correlations with humidity-corrected AOD, uncorrected AOD, vertical and humidity-corrected AOD, and uncorrected AOD, respectively, indicating a distinct seasonal variation of the aerosol characteristics. At spatial scales of 1-5 km, AOD at finer spatial scales generally had higher correlations with PM2.5 concentrations. However, at spatial scales <1 km, the correlations fluctuated irregularly, which could be attributed to scale mismatches between AOD and PM2.5 measurements. Thus, 1 km appears to be the optimum spatial scale for DT-derived AOD to maximize the correlation with PM2.5 concentrations. It is also recommended to aggregate very high-resolution DT-derived AOD to an appropriate medium resolution (e.g., 1 km) before matching them with in situ PM2.5 measurements in regional air pollution studies.

TI  - The Dead, the Living, and the Sacred Patsy Mink, Antimilitarism, and Reimagining the Pacific World
T2  - MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the antinuclear and antimilitarism politics of Patsy Takemoto Mink (1927-2002), the first Japanese American female lawyer in Hawaii, the first woman of color to become a U.S. congressional representative, and the namesake for Title IX. During the late 1960s and 1970s, Mink challenged the use of the Pacific lands, waters, and peoples as sites of military experimentation, subject to nuclear and chemical testing as well as war games. Mink's political worldview, shaped by her experiences and understanding of the interconnectedness between human and nonhuman life as well as water and land, reflected a Pacific World sensibility. She worked with, but also articulated political priorities that differed from, indigenous peoples of the Pacific. Focusing on these connected yet divergent Pacific imaginaries provides an opportunity to explore the significance of these antimilitarism campaigns for the study of transnational feminisms as well as Asian American and Pacific Islander studies. First, the protests of Mink and Native Hawaiian activists against U.S. militarism in the Pacific represented gendered critiques of U.S. empire, although in different ways. Second, Mink's advocacy via political liberalism provided opportunities for coalition formation yet also constrained the range of her gendered arguments and limited possible solutions beyond the U.S. polity. Third, the coalitional possibilities and incommensurabilities reveal the points of convergence and divergence between Asian American demands for full inclusion and Pacific Islander calls for decolonization and sovereignty.

TI  - Microwave Land Emissivity Calculations over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Using FY-3B/MWRI Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan plateau plays an important role in climate change with its unique characteristics, and the surface emissivity is an important parameter to describe the surface characteristics. It is also very important for the accurate retrieval of surface and atmospheric parameters. Different types of surface features have their own radiation characteristics due to their differences in structure, water content and roughness. In this study, the microwave land surface emissivity (10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5 and 89 GHz) of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was calculated using the simplified microwave radiation transmission equation under clear atmospheric conditions based on Level 1 brightness temperatures from the Microwave Radiation Imager onboard the FY-3B meteorological satellite (FY-3B/MWRI) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final (NCEP-FNL) Global Operational Analysis dataset. Furthermore, according to the IGBP (International Geosphere-Biosphere Program) classified data, the spectrum and spatial distribution characteristics of microwave surface emittance in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau were further analyzed. The results show that almost all 16 types of emissivity from IGBP at dual-polarization (vertical and horizontal) increase with the increase of frequency. The spatial distribution of the retrieving results is in line with the changes of surface cover types on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, showing the distribution characteristics of large polarization difference of surface emissivity in the northwest and small polarization difference in the southeast, and diverse vegetation can be clearly seen in the retrieving results. In addition, the emissivity is closely related to the type of land surface. Since the emissivity of vegetation is higher than that of bare soil, the contribution of bare soil increases and the surface emissivity decreases as the density of vegetation decreases. Finally, the source of retrieval error was analyzed. The errors in calculating the surface emissivity might mainly come from spatiotemporal collocation of reanalysis data with satellite measurements, the quality of these auxiliary datasets and cloud and precipitation pixel discrimination scheme. Further quantitative analysis of these errors is required, and even standard procedures may need to be improved as well to improve the accuracy of the calculation.

TI  - A spatiotemporal deep learning model for sea surface temperature field prediction using time-series satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is a vitally important parameter of the global ocean, which can profoundly affect the climate and marine ecosystems. To achieve an accurate and holistic prediction of the short and mid-term SST field, a spatiotemporal deep learning model is proposed which can capture the correlations of SST across both space and time. The model uses the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) as the building block and is trained in an end-to-end manner. Experiments using 36-year satellite-derived SST data in a subarea of the East China Sea demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the persistence model, the linear support vector regression (SVR) model, and two LSTM models with different settings, when judged using multiple statistics and from different perspectives. The results suggest that the proposed model is highly promising for short and mid-term daily SST field prediction accurately and conveniently.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations and trends of MODIS C6.1 Dark Target and Deep Blue merged aerosol optical depth over China during 2000-2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The variations and trends of the AOD (aerosol optical depth, at 550 nm) from 2000 to 2017 in mainland China were analyzed in this paper with monthly, seasonal, and yearly mean data, derived from the NASA combined MODIS Dark Target and Deep Blue AOD retrievals. Particularly, the distribution and variation of AOD over the desert region of the southern Xinjiang basin which is one of the major Asian dust sources was described. To investigate the seasonal and yearly variation trends of the AOD over China, the linear trend was analyzed for each point during the 18 years. The correlations between AOD and terrain, Gross Domestic Product and Population Density were also analyzed. The results were as follows. (1) In China, the all-year high value (tau(MODIS) > 0.50) of the AOD occurred in the Sichuan basin, the Two Lakes Plain, North China, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Guangzhong Plain, and the Jingjinji Metropolitan Region. In particular, the southern Xinjiang basin is not the high value center. While the all-year low value (tau(MODIS) < 0.20) of the AOD occurred in Northwest Sichuan, Southeast Xizang, the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (Tibetan Plateau), Northern Xinjiang, Shanxi, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. (2) The AOD over China varied with years from 2000 to 2017, which increased in the previous decade but gradually decreased from 2011. (3) The AOD changed more significantly with the seasons, with higher AOD in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. (4) The AOD was negatively associated with Digital Elevation Model, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.733, which was positively associated with Gross Domestic Product and Population Density, with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.698 and 0.688.

TI  - Using Landsat observations (1988-2017) and Google Earth Engine to detect vegetation cover changes in rangelands - A first step towards identifying degraded lands for conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the area of agricultural land is shrinking in part due to environmental degradation. Acquisition and restoration of degraded lands no longer used for agriculture may present a major conservation opportunity with minimal social and political opposition. The ability to efficiently and accurately identify these lands from regional to global scales will aid conservation management, ultimately enhancing the global prospects of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Remote Sensing provides a potential tool to identify areas where surface property changes can be mapped and linked with land degradation. In this study, we begin to tackle a small section of this challenge by presenting novel approach to mapping changes in vegetation cover amounts at the pixel level (30 m), using Google Earth Engine (GEE). We illustrate our approach across large-scale rangelands in Queensland Australia, using three decades of Landsat satellite imagery (1988-2017) along with field observations of land condition scores for validation. The approach used an existing method for dynamic reference cover to remove the rainfall variability and focused on the human management effects on the vegetation cover changes.Results showed the identified vegetation cover changes could be categorized into five classes of decrease, increase or stable cover compared with a set reference level, which was obtained from locations of the most persistent ground cover across all dry years. In total, vegetation cover decrease was observed in 20% of our study area, with similar portion of lands recovering and the rest (similar to 60%) staying stable. The lands with decrease in vegetation cover, covering a considerable area of similar to 2 x 10(5) km(2), exhibited a markedly reduced resilience to droughts. The accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 82.6% (+/- 3.32 standard error) with 75.0% (+/- 5.16%) and 70.0% (+/- 4.13%) producer's and user's accuracy for areas experiencing a significant decrease in vegetation cover, respectively. Identifying areas of degraded land will require multiple stages of spatial data analysis and this work provided the first stage for identifying vegetation cover changes in large-scale rangeland environment, and provides a platform for future research and development to identify degraded lands and their utility for achieving conservation endeavours.

TI  - Monitoring the impact of climate change and human activities on grassland vegetation dynamics in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China during 2000-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities can influence vegetation net primary productivity (NPP), a key component of natural ecosystems. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, in spite of its significant natural and cultural values, is one of the most susceptible regions to climate change and human disturbances in the world. To assess the impact of climate change and human activities on vegetation dynamics in the grassland ecosystems of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we applied a time-series trend analysis to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets from 2000 to 2015 and compared these spatiotemporal variations with trends in climatic variables over the same time period. The constrained ordination approach (redundancy analysis) was used to determine which climatic variables or human-related factors mostly influenced the variation of NDVI. Furthermore, in order to determine whether current conservation measures and programs are effective in ecological protection and reconstruction, we divided the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into two parts: the Three-River Headwater conservation area (TRH zone) in the south and the non-conservation area (NTRH zone) in the north. The results indicated an overall (73.32%) increasing trend of vegetation NPP in grasslands throughout the study area. During the period 2000-2015, NDVI in the TRH and NTRH zones increased at the rates of 0.0015/a and 0.0020/a, respectively. Specifically, precipitation accounted for 9.2% of the total variation in NDVI, while temperature accounted for 13.4%. In addition, variation in vegetation NPP of grasslands responded not only to long- and short-term changes in climate, as conceptualized in non-equilibrium theory, but also to the impact of human activities and their associated perturbations. The redundancy analysis successfully separated the relative contributions of climate change and human activities, of which village population and agricultural gross domestic product were the two most important contributors to the NDVI changes, explaining 17.8% and 17.1% of the total variation of NDVI (with the total contribution >30.0%), respectively. The total contribution percentages of climate change and human activities to the NDVI variation were 27.5% and 34.9%, respectively, in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Finally, our study shows that the grassland restoration in the study area was enhanced by protection measures and programs in the TRH zone, which explained 7.6% of the total variation in NDVI.

TI  - Mapping impervious surface fractions using automated Fisher transformed unmixing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial explicit monitoring of impervious surface fractions provides essential information for urban planning, urban disaster prevention and mitigation. Moderate spectral and spatial resolution satellite observation has become a tool to perform such monitoring across different spatial and temporal scales. Yet, one major challenge in urban remote sensing is the high spatial heterogeneity causing the presence of image pixels constituting a mixture of different land cover materials. Here we apply an automated unmixing procedure specifically designed to optimally account for the pronounced spectral variability (i.e. high within-class and low between-class variability) prevailing in urban settings. The approach is based on Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), a data dimensionality reduction technique in which between-class variability is maximized and within-class variability is minimized while transforming spectra from the reflectance to the Fisher feature space. We integrated the FDA transformation in the widely-applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) approach in an attempt to more effectively address the endmember variability problem. We made use of online spectral libraries to train the Fisher transformation parameters and steer the automated selection of image endmembers. Our Fisher transformed MESMA algorithm (F-MESMA) was tested on medium spatial resolution Landsat scenes and impervious fraction maps were generated for five major cities located in different regions of the world. The output of F-MESMA was compared to the output of state-of-the-art spectral mixture analysis approaches which were specifically designed to reduce endmember variability issues. We could demonstrate that compared to other spectral transformation approaches, the ratio of within- vs between-class variability of the endmembers was most strongly reduced after applying the Fisher transformation. As a direct consequence, across all five cities F-MESMA consistently provided the most accurate impervious surface fraction estimates (RMSEF-MESMA = 0.13 vs. RMSEalternative approaches = [0.16-0.17]).

TI  - Detecting Ecological Changes with a Remote Sensing Based Ecological Index (RSEI) Produced Time Series and Change Vector Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing human activities have caused significant global ecosystem disturbances at various scales. There is an increasing need for effective techniques to quantify and detect ecological changes. Remote sensing can serve as a measurement surrogate of spatial changes in ecological conditions. This study has improved a newly-proposed remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) with a sharpened land surface temperature image and then used the improved index to produce the time series of ecological-status images. The Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen estimator were employed to evaluate the significance of the trend of the RSEI time series and the direction of change. The change vector analysis (CVA) was employed to detect ecological changes based on the image series. This RSEI-CVA approach was applied to Fujian province, China to quantify and detect the ecological changes of the province in a period from 2002 to 2017 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The result shows that the RSEI-CVA method can effectively quantify and detect spatiotemporal changes in ecological conditions of the province, which reveals an ecological improvement in the province during the study period. This is indicated by the rise of mean RSEI scores from 0.794 to 0.852 due to an increase in forest area by 7078 km(2). Nevertheless, CVA-based change detection has detected ecological declines in the eastern coastal areas of the province. This study shows that the RSEI-CVA approach would serve as a prototype method to quantify and detect ecological changes and hence promote ecological change detection at various scales.

TI  - Spatial Upscaling of Tree-Ring-Based Forest Response to Drought with Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have integrated the observational capability of satellite remote sensing with plot-scale tree-ring data to upscale the evaluation of forest responses to drought. Satellite data, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), can provide a spatially continuous measure with limited temporal coverage, while tree-ring width index (RWI) provides an accurate assessment with a much longer time series at local scales. Here, we explored the relationship between RWI and NDVI of three dominant species in the Southwestern United States (SWUS) and predicted RWI spatial distribution from 2001 to 2017 based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1-km resolution NDVI data with stringent quality control. We detected the optimum time windows (around June-August) during which the RWI and NDVI were most closely correlated for each species, when the canopy growth had the greatest effect on growth of tree trunks. Then, using our upscaling algorithm of NDVI-based RWI, we were able to detect the significant impact of droughts in 2002 and in 2011-2014, which supported the validity of this algorithm in quantifying forest response to drought on a large scale.

TI  - Fine-Grained Air Quality Inference with Remote Sensing Data and Ubiquitous Urban Data
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality has gained much attention in recent years and is of great importance to protecting people's health. Due to the influence of multiple factors, the limited air quality monitoring stations deployed in cities are unable to provide fine-grained air quality information. One cost-effective way is to infer air quality with records from existing monitoring stations. However, the severe data sparsity problem (e.g., only 0.2% data are known) leads to the failure of most inference methods. We observe that remote sensing data are of high quality and have a strong correlation with the air quality. Therefore, we propose to integrate remote sensing data and ubiquitous urban data for the air quality inference. But there are two main challenges, i.e., data heterogeneity and incompleteness of the remote sensing data. To address the challenges, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we infer and predict air quality conditions of some places leveraging the remote sensing data and meteorological data with two proposed ANN-based methods, respectively. This stage significantly alleviates the data sparsity problem. In the second stage, the records and estimated air quality data are put in a tensor. A tensor decomposition method is applied to complete the tensor. The features extracted from urban data are classified into the spatial features (i.e., road features and POI features) and the temporal features (i.e., meteorological features) as the constraints to further address the data sparsity problem. In addition, an iterative training framework is proposed to improve the inference performance. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as U-Air.

TI  - The 2-Look TOPS Mode: Design and Demonstration With TerraSAR-X
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burst-mode acquisition schemes achieve wide coverage at the expense of a degraded azimuth resolution, reducing, therefore, the performance on the retrieval of ground displacements in the azimuth direction, when interferometric acquisitions are combined. Moreover, the azimuth varying line of sight can induce discontinuities in the interferometric phase when local azimuth displacements are present, e.g., due to ground deformation. In this contribution, we propose the interferometric 2-look terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode, a sustaining innovation, which records bursts of radar echoes of two separated slices of the Doppler spectrum. The spectral separation allows to exploit spectral diversity techniques, achieving sensitivities to azimuth displacements better than with StripMap and eliminating discontinuities in the interferometric phase. Moreover, some limitations of the TOPS mode to compensate ionospheric perturbations, in terms of data gaps or restricted sensitivity to azimuth shifts, are overcome. The design of 2-look TOPS acquisitions will be provided, taking the TerraSAR-X system as reference to derive achievable performances. The methodology for the retrieval of the azimuth displacement is exposed for the case of using pairs of images, as well as for the calculation of mean azimuth velocities when working with stacks. We include results with experimental TerraSAR-X acquisitions demonstrating its applicability for both scenarios.

TI  - A spatio-temporal variation analysis of Fedchenko and Grumm-Grzhimaylo glacier motion pattern with an efficient pixel-tracking method on spaceborne SAR imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive analysis of glacier dynamic evolution is essential to understand the influence of global climate change at different time scales. In this paper, we derive surface velocity fields of Fedchenko and Grumm-Grzhimaylo glacier during four different periods in 2007-2008 with an efficient pixel-tracking (PT) method on ALOS/PALSAR imagery. The improving PT method operates with an ice region mask file and the execution time is reduced to about only a quarter of original one on experimental data or even less with the same computer configurations. The comparison of ice motion monitoring results yields that ice flow velocity in the middle and lower parts of Fedchenko glacier is generally higher than that in the upper part, with the maximum value of 82.60 cm day(-1) in winter. Between winters, respectively, in 2007 and 2008, no pronounced inter-annual variation was found with the average change rate of 2.8%. Besides, the ice flow velocity in the terminus slows down mainly attributing to the impediments of 6.5-km-long glacier debris, while velocity in the spring is significantly faster than that in the winter. And its monthly ice flow velocity increased by 6.5% from February to April and 57.8% from April to May. Besides, the maximum speed of Grumm-Grzhimaylo glacier in winter is 50.91 cm day(-1) along with a significant acceleration in spring. Obviously, the long-term observation of spatio-temporal variation in glacier motion with efficient PT method would benefit the studies of glacier dynamics and climate change.

TI  - Surveillance of <i>Culicoides</i> biting midges in northern Honshu, Japan, during the period of Akabane virus spread
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A surveillance of Culicoides biting midges with light suction traps was conducted in the northern region of Honshu, main island of Japan, during the summers and autumns of 2009 and 2010. A total of 106 trap collections across 37 cattle farms were investigated for the structure and distribution of Culicoides species. Forty-thousand and one hundred forty-nine specimens of Culicoides biting midges were identified at the species level, and >= 19 species were included in the specimens. Culicoides oxystoma, which is a known major vector of Akabane virus (AKAV), appeared not to have expanded in northern Honshu during the surveillance. Of the potential AKAV vectors suggested by a previous laboratory experiment, C. tainanus and C. punctatus widely infested cowsheds across northern Honshu. The AKAV circulation was confirmed by serological surveillance of sentinel cattle in northern Honshu during the summer and autumn of 2010 and, consequently, >200 calves affected by the virus were identified as of spring 2011. Our surveillance demonstrated that C. tainanus and C. punctatus were widely spread and often dominated at cattle farms in/around the seroconverted regions, and our results thus suggest that these species played a critical role in the AKAV transmission in 2010. Because the distribution ranges of C. tainanus and C. punctatus cover almost all of mainland Japan, a potential risk of AKAV transmission might be expected even in areas outside the range of C. oxystoma.

TI  - Detecting Spatiotemporal Features and Rationalities of Urban Expansions within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area of China from 1987 to 2017 Using Time-Series Landsat Images and Socioeconomic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China is one of the major bay areas in the world. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics and rationalities of urban expansions within this region over a relatively long period of time are not well-understood. This study explored the spatiotemporal evolution of 11 cities within the GBA in 1987-2017 by integrating remote sensing, landscape analysis, and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, and further evaluated the rationalities of their expansion using the urban area population elastic coefficient (UPEC) and the urban area gross domestic product (GDP) elastic coefficient (UGEC). The results showed the following: (1) Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai experienced unprecedented urbanization compared with the other cities, and from 1987 to 2017, their urban areas expanded by 10.12, 11.48, 14.21, 24.90, 37.07, and 30.15 times, respectively; (2) several expansion patterns were observed in the 11 cities, including a mononuclear polygon radiation pattern (Guangzhou and Foshan), a double-nucleated polygon pattern (Macau and Zhongshan), and a multi-nuclear urbanization pattern (Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Dongguan, Jiangmen, Huizhou, Zhaoqing, and Zhuhai); (3) with regard to the proportion of area, the edge-expansion and outlying growth types were the predominant types for all 11 cities, and the infilling growth type was the one of the important types during 2007-2017 for Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Dongguan, Zhongshan, and Foshan; (4) the expansion of most cities took on an urban-to-rural landscape gradient, especially for Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Zhongshan, Dongguan, and Zhuhai; and (5) the rationalities of expansion in several time periods were rational for Guangzhou (1997-2007), Hong Kong (2007-2017), Foshan (1987-2007), Huizhou (1987-1997), and Dongguan (1997-2007), and the rationalities of expansion in the other cities and time periods were found to be irrational. These findings may help policy- and decision-makers to maintain the sustainable development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.

TI  - A Simultaneous Imaging Scheme of Stationary Clutter and Moving Targets for Maritime Scenarios with the First Chinese Dual-Channel Spaceborne SAR Sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The technique of azimuth multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system has become a potential solution to the irreconcilable conflict between high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) confronted with in a traditional SAR system. Unambiguous imaging, especially for a scene with moving targets, is one of the crucial research topics in the HRWS SAR system. This paper proposes a simultaneous imaging scheme of moving targets and stationary clutter for maritime scenarios. First, the moving target echoes are extracted from the stationary clutter. After that, two methods working in completely different principles are used to estimate the radial velocity of each moving target, and the estimated result is used for phase compensation. After that, the moving target echoes are added back to the stationary scene echo and sent to the reconstruction filter. Lastly, the reconstructed echo can be processed by the classical Chirp Scaling (CS) algorithm. Experiments are carried out using the Chinese GaoFen-3 dual-channel data. The estimated velocities of the moving targets are verified by automatic identification service (AIS) information, and the imaging results show that the false targets are effectively suppressed and the moving targets also return to their correct positions along the azimuth.

TI  - Monitoring policy-driven crop area adjustments in northeast China using Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To keep pace with increasing demands for food, China is advancing robust policies on food security, and policy-oriented adjustments in crop planting area are needed to strike a balance among environmental sustainability, socio-economic development, agriculture and food security. To this end, the crop area adjustment policy was introduced in northeast China since 2015 and the policy provides incentives for quick planting area changes between different crops. However, geospatial data that quantify the magnitude and direction of these crop area adjustments are grossly inadequate in content and accuracy, thereby limiting our understanding of the overall policy impacts. To fill these data needs, applying the random forest (RF) classification algorithm on temporal images of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (011) acquired over the Heilongjiang Province (1235 scenes) in 2015 and 2016, this study proposed an integrated approach to the identification and monitoring of adjustments in the planting areas of maize, soybean and paddy rice. Overall crop classification accuracies of 88.7% and 87.9% were obtained for 2015 and 2016, respectively, and our approach further accounted for localized error distribution patterns. The result indicated that the area of soybean and maize had a significant change in 2016 (maize area decreased by 22.0% with about 1,261,775 ha and soybean area increased by 39.8% with about 696,653 ha, compared to 2015). The expansion in soybean-planted area recorded in this study is mostly in regions that previously mapped suitable for soybean cultivation based on local agro-climatic factors. The decrease in maize-planted area in tandem with the increase in soybean-planted area is significant in the northern parts of the Songneng Plain where initial profit differentials between the two crops are minimal due to being more suitable for soybean, and where with the introduction of subsidies, soybean recorded higher profits per unit area than maize. This suggests that with more incentives to cover the profit margin between soybean and maize, or the direction of subsidies to areas where soybean naturally records higher yields as a function of land suitability, the crop area adjustment policy is expected to achieve its goal in Heilongjiang. The current study, having provided information on the relative shifts in agricultural land-uses as informed by agricultural policy and land suitability data at a biannual scale, more detailed studies that would apply the proposed approach to multiple years of satellite data are therefore encouraged to provide information on the dynamics of agricultural land-use as informed by climate-induced changes inland suitability, market demand and government policy.

TI  - Modelling of soil organic carbon and bulk density in invaded coastal wetlands using Sentinel-1 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil monitoring information is important to improve our understanding of the role of soil on global environment change such as invasion of foreign species. For regions with dense vegetation cover the use of remote sensing data provides an attractive solution to soil prediction through the relationship between soil and remotely sensed information of vegetation, especially considering the availability of multi-temporal series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data such as Sentinel-1. In this study, we used a structural equation model (SEM) to link soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density (BD) with temporal variation of SAR signals, taking into account possible interacting relationships of the soil-vegetation system. The test area is in the coastal wetlands of east-central China, where Sentinel-1 data were acquired during the vegetation growing season in 2017. A total of fifteen sites were sampled at three depths: 0-30 cm, 30-60 cm, and 60-100 cm. Predictive accuracy was assessed using leave-oneout cross-validation (LOOCV). Results showed that SE models successfully predicted SOC (RMSE = 1.63 g kg(-1), RPD = 1.22) and BD (RMSE = 0.14 g cm(-3), RPD = 1.25) at three depths. We found that SEM supported the idea that the interrelationships exist among soil, vegetation, and remotely sensed information, and improved our ability to investigate relationships between SAR backscatters and soil attributes. The use of time series Sentinel-1 data allowed capturing characteristics of vegetation dynamics and the possible relationships between soil attribute and vegetation. The findings from this study highlight the usefulness of dense temporal SAR data and SEM in soil prediction.

TI  - Weighted Double-Logistic Function Fitting Method for Reconstructing the High-Quality Sentinel-2 NDVI Time Series Data Set
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The time series (TS) of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used to trace the temporal and spatial variability of terrestrial vegetation. However, many factors such as atmospheric noise and radiometric correction residuals conceal the actual variation in the land surface, and thus hamper the TS information extraction. To minimize the negative effects of these noise factors, we propose a new method to produce a synthetic gap-free NDVI TS from the original contaminated observation. First, the key temporal points are identified from the NDVI time profiles based on a generally used rule-based strategy, making the TS segmented into several adjacent segments. Then, the observed data points in each segment are fitted with a weighted double-logistic function. The proposed dynamic weight reassignment process effectively emphasizes cloud-free points and deemphasizes cloud-contaminated points. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on more than 3,000 test points from three selected Sentinel-2 tiles, and is compared with the generally used Savitzky-Golay (S-G) and harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) methods from qualitative and quantitative aspects. The results indicate that the proposed method has a higher capability of retaining cloud-free data points and identifying outliers than the others, and can generate a gap-free NDVI time profile derived from a medium-resolution satellite sensor.

TI  - Remote Sensing Classification of Wetlands based on Object-oriented and CART Decision Tree Method
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Beijing was taken as the research field to discuss the extraction methods for classification of multi-type wetlands in large areas. [Method] Object-oriented multi-scale segmentation algorithm and spectral difference segmentation were used to segment the Landsat8 OLI image, and stratified sampling method was used to generate random training samples and validation samples by Google Earth high-definition image and manual interpretation results for 2015. Subsequently, CART Decision Tree was constructed to extract wetland information by combining spectral, shape, texture features and topological relation. The results were compared with maximum likelihood method and object-oriented and nearest neighbor method. [Result] Using object-oriented and CART Decision Tree, the total accuracy of the results was 88.05%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.844. Compared with the object-oriented and nearest neighbor, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient showed less difference, but for some wetland types, such as rivers and swamp, the accuracy increased by 10% to 20%; the total accuracy was nearly 30% higher than that of the maximum likelihood classification, and the Kappa coefficient increased by 0.355. [Conclusion] Object-oriented and CART Decision Tree is a fast and effective method for wetland classification in the areas with wide distribution, multi-types and quantities of wetland.

TI  - Constructing long-term high-frequency time series of global lake and reservoir areas using Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved monitoring of inundation area variations in lakes and reservoirs is crucial for assessing surface water resources in a growing population and a changing climate. Although long-record optical satellites, such as Landsat missions, provide sub-monthly observations at fairly fine spatial resolution, cloud contamination often poses a major challenge for producing temporally continuous time series. We here proposed a novel method to improve the temporal frequency of usable Landsat observations for mapping lakes and reservoirs, by effectively recovering inundation areas from contaminated images. This method automated three primary steps on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. It first leveraged multiple spectral indices to optimize water mapping from archival Landsat images acquired since 1992. Errors induced by minor contaminations were next corrected by the topology of isobaths extracted from nearly cloud-free images. The isobaths were then used to recover water areas under major contaminations through an efficient vector-based interpolation. We validated this method on 428 lakes/reservoirs worldwide that range from similar to 2 km(2) to similar to 82,000 km(2) with time-variable levels measured by satellite altimeters. The recovered water areas show a relative root-mean-squared error of 2.2%, and the errors for over 95% of the lakes/reservoirs below 6.0%. The produced area time series, combining those from cloud-free images and recovered from contaminated images, exhibit strong correlations with altimetry levels (Spearman's rho mostly similar to 0.8 or larger) and extended the hypsometric (area-level) ranges revealed by cloud-free images alone. The combined time series also improved the monthly coverage by an average of 43%, resulting in a bi-monthly water area record during the satellite altimetry era thus far (1992-2018). The robustness of this method was further verified under five challenging mapping scenarios, including fluvial lakes in humid basins, reservoirs with complex shape geometries, saline lakes with high mineral concentrations, lakes/reservoirs in mountainous regions, and pan-Arctic lakes with frequent snow/ice covers. Given such performance and a generic nature of this method, we foresee its potential applications to assisting water area recovery for other optical and SAR sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 and SWOT), and to estimating lake/reservoir storage variations in conjunction with altimetry sensors.

TI  - Effect of urban function and landscape structure on the urban heat island phenomenon in Beijing, China
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has aggravated the urban thermal risk and highlighted the urban heat island (UHI) effect. To improve understanding on the effect of urbanization on the UHI effect, it is essential to determine the relationship between the UHI effect and the complexities of urban function and landscape structure. For this purpose, 5116 urban function zones (UFZs), representing the basic function units of urban planning, were identified in Beijing. Land cover and land surface temperature (LST) values were extracted based on remote sensing data. UFZ, land cover, and LST were used to represent the urban function, landscape, and UHI characteristics, respectively. Then, the effects of urban function and landscape structure on the UHI effect were examined. The results indicated that the urban thermal environment exhibited obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to the variation of urban function and landscape complexity: (1) UFZs showed significantly different LST characteristics for different functions and seasons, and the mean LST gap among different types of UFZ can reach 1.72-3.85 degrees C. (2) During warm seasons, the UHI region is mainly composed of residential, industrial, and commercial zones, while recreational zones contribute as an important UHI source region during cold seasons. (3) Urban developed land and forest are the most important landscape factors contributing to the UFZ effect in the urban thermal environment. These findings have useful implications for urban landscape zoning to mitigate the UHI effect.

TI  - A Typhoon Wind-Field Retrieval Method for the Dual-Polarization SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is widely used to detect sea surface wind. It has been found that the signals of co-polarization SAR tend to become saturated under high wind-speed conditions. Also, low signal-to-noise ratios of cross-polarization SAR have been observed under low wind-speed conditions. In this letter, a typhoon wind-field retrieval method is developed by compositing the wind speeds retrieved from dual-polarized SAR images. This letter then applies the proposed method to eight typhoons (four from the Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellite and four from the Chinese Gaofen-3 satellite). The results show that the method is successful in regard to fine typhoon wind structure retrieval, with a root-mean-square error of wind direction of 12 degrees and a wind speed of 1.7 m/s, against 12 oceanic buoy measurements in the South China Sea.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Axillary Ultrasound in Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard application for evaluating the axilla in patients with breast cancer. The Z0011 trial conducted by The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) revealed that axillary dissection may be redundant in selected patients with positive sentinel node. This raises questions regarding the application of this result to ultrasound-positive patients. This research therefore aimed to evaluate how accurate an ultrasound scan is for axillary node status in early-stage breast carcinoma. The study included 156 newly diagnosed clinical T1-T2, N0 breast cancer patients attending our breast clinic between January 2010 and February 2016. Sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node clearance in the presence of sentinel lymph node metastasis was performed on all the breast cancer patients. Axillary ultrasound reports were reviewed retrospectively and the results compared with surgical pathology results. The sensitivity and specificity of axillary ultrasound for detecting axillary lymph node disease was 69.2% and 98%, respectively, with a negative predictive value of 86.4% and positive predictive value of 94.7%. Given the high sensitivity and specificity, and high positive predictive value and negative predictive value demonstrated in the present study, axillary ultrasound represents a potential alternative to sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging of the axilla in early breast cancer. Subsequent trials (SOUND) comparing axillary ultrasound alone with sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer patients will provide additional information about the subject.

TI  - Least-Squares Estimation for Pseudo Quad-Pol Image Reconstruction from Linear Compact Polarimetric SAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact polarimetry is a hybrid dual-polarization imaging mode, which is used to enable wide swath coverages and provide more polarimetric information compared with the conventional dual-polarimetric imaging modes (HH/HV and VH/VV). In applications of compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR), pseudo quad-polarimetric (quad-pol) image reconstruction is an important technique. In this study, we propose a least-squares (LS) based method to estimate the quad-pol covariance elements for the linear pi/4 compact polarimetric mode. Different from existing quad-pol reconstruction approaches, which use an iterative approach to refine the model solution based on multi-look data, the LS method uses a set of data points to best fit the reconstruction model and is applicable to both multi-look and single-look complex data. In this study, a decomposition-based three-component reconstruction model is exploited to construct the system of non-linear equations. Then, the minimization problem is addressed in a local window for the cross-polarized term, which is optimized with bound constraints. Furthermore, the m - alpha(s) decomposition for the linear compact mode is developed, which is used to approximate the reconstruction model parameter for the LS model function. Experiments are performed on C-band RADARSAT-2 data collected over agriculture fields, an urban area, and an area with complex terrain types. In comparison with the iterative-based methods, the LS-based reconstruction method shows its superiority in estimating both the cross-polarized term and the co-polarized phase difference.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that intact tropical forests account for half of the total terrestrial sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Here, we analyzed and compared changes in three main tropical forest regions from 2000 to 2014, based on time-series analysis and landscape metrics derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data. We examined spatial-pattern changes in percentage of tree cover and net primary production (NPP) for three tropical forest regions-Amazon basin, Congo basin, and Southeast Asia. The results show that: the Amazon basin region had the largest tropical forest area and total NPP and a better continuity of TC distribution; the Southeast Asia region exhibited a sharp decrease in NPP and had comparatively separate spatial patterns of both TC and NPP; and the Congo basin region exhibited a dramatic increase in NPP and had better aggregation of forest NPP distribution. Results also show that aggregative patterns likely correlate with high NPP values.

TI  - Ultrasound assessment of translation of microbubbles driven by acoustic radiation force in a channel filled with stationary fluid
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this report, a method is proposed to quantify the translation of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) microbubbles driven by acoustic radiation for the detection of channels filled with stationary fluid. The authors subjected UCA microbubbles in a channel with diameters of 0.1 and 0.5mm to ultrasound pulses with a center frequency of 14.4MHz. The translational velocity of the UCA microbubbles increased with the sound pressure and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the transmitted ultrasound. The mean translational velocity reached 0.75 mm/s at a negative peak sound pressure of 2.76 MPa and a PRF of 2 kHz. This trend agreed with the theoretical prediction, which indicated that the translational velocity was proportional to the square of the sound pressure and the PRF. Furthermore, an experiment was carried out with a phantom that mimics tissue and found that the proposed method aided in detection of the channel, even in the case of a low contrast-echo to tissue-echo ratio. The authors expect to develop the proposed method into a technique for detecting lymph vessels. (C) 2019 Acoustical Society of America.

TI  - Ultrasound-based radiomics nomogram: A potential biomarker to predict axillary lymph node metastasis in early-stage invasive breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To establish a radiomics nomogram integrating clinical factors and radiomics features from ultrasound for the preoperative diagnosis axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (EIBC).Materials and methods: Between September 2016 and December 2018, four hundred twenty-six ultrasound manually segmented images of patients with EIBC were enrolled in our retrospective study, which were divided into a primary cohort (n = 300) and a validation cohort (n = 126). A radiomics signature was built with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm in the primary cohort. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to establish a radiomics nomogram model based on radiomics signature and clinical variables. The performance of nomogram was quantified with respect to discrimination and calibration. The radiomics model was further evaluated in the internal validation cohort.Results: The radiomics signature, consisted of fourteen selected ALN-status-related features, achieved moderate prediction efficacy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 and 0.71 in the primary and validation cohorts respectively. The radiomics nomogram, comprising tumor size, US-reported LN status and radiomics signature, showed good calibration and favorite performance for ALN detection (AUC 0.84 and 0.81 in the primary and validation cohort). The decision curve which was demonstrated the radiomics nomogram displayed good clinical utility.Conclusion: The radiomics nomogram could hold promise as a non-invasive and reliable tool in predicting ALN metastasis and may facilitate to develop more effective preoperative decision-making.

TI  - Development of Continuous Ground Deformation Monitoring System using Sentinel Satellite in the Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed the automatic ground deformation monitoring system using Sentinel-1 satellites which is operating by European Space Agency (ESA) for the Korea Peninsula's ground disaster monitoring. Ground deformation occurring over a long-term period are difficult to monitoring because it occurred in a wide area and required a large amount of satellite data for analysis. With the development of satellites, the methods to regularly observe large areas has been developed. These accumulated satellite data are used for time series ground displacement analysis. The National Disaster Management Research Institute (NDMI) established an automation system for all processes ranging from acquiring satellite observation data to analyzing ground displacement and expressing them. Based on the system developed in this research, ground displacement data on the Korean Peninsula can be updated periodically. In the future, more diverse ground displacement information could be provided if automated small regional analysis systems, multi-channel analysis method, and 3D analysis system techniques are developed with the existing system.

TI  - Spectral Characteristics and Remote Sensing Model of Tailings with Different Water Contents
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tailing ponds are widely distributed in China. Once the surface tailings are under low moisture content, the tailing dust would cause severely environmental pollution driven by the wind action. Because of the large area and rapidly variation of moisture content of tailing ponds, the traditional method with the limitation on low efficiency, safety and high cost cannot meet the requirement of quick and dynamic moisture content monitoring. Currently, although the remote sensing technology based on spectral model can provide accurate prediction of soil moisture content, this model is not fit to tailing moisture content prediction because of the different characteristics and components between soil and tails. Therefore, the Fengshuigou tailing pond in Liaoning Province was selected as the study area. First, the samples of tailings at different moisture content were collected and configured. Then, the visible-near infrared spectra of the samples were measured and analyzed. Furthermore, the relationship between moisture contents and spectral characteristics was established. Finally, the remote sensing inversion model for moisture contents prediction was built and applied for mapping the moisture content in this study area. This study yielded the following results: (1) The moisture content has a significant effect on the spectral characteristics of tailings, and the reflectance decreased obviously as the moisture content increased. The longer the wavelength is, the more significant the effect of water content on the spectrum is. (2) The remote sensing model based on the spectral characteristic for tailings moisture content prediction was established. In terms of the band 6 and band 7 from Landsat8-OLI imagery, the ratio index (RTI), normalized difference index (NDTI) and difference index (DTI) of tailings were proposed and selected as the input data for the random forest model. By comparing the random forest model and Log reflectance model, the random forest model can generate more accurate predicting results. (3) The tailings moisture content map was generated by applying the random forest predicting model with spectral index based on the Landsat-OLI imagery. From the field verification, the coefficie of determination (R-2), RMSE, RPD, and ARE is 0. 798, 0. 077, 1. 970 and 20. 1% respectively between the predicted and field measured moisture content. The results could provide an effective and real-time method for large scale moisture content predicting of the tailing ponds from the metamorphic iron ore area.

TI  - Transcriptome Analyses of FY Mutants Reveal Its Role in mRNA Alternative Polyadenylation
T2  - PLANT CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - A crucial step for mRNA polyadenylation is poly(A) signal recognition by trans-acting factors. The mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex components CPSF30 and WD repeat-containing protein33 (WDR33) recognize the canonical AAUAAA for polyadenylation. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the flowering time regulator FY is the homolog of WDR33. However, its role in mRNA polyadenylation is poorly understood. Using poly(A) tag sequencing, we found that >50% of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events are altered in fy single mutants or double mutants with oxt6 (a null mutant of AtCPSF30), but mutation of the FY WD40-repeat has a stronger effect than deletion of the plant-unique Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro-Pro (PPLPP) domain. fy mutations disrupt AAUAAA or AAUAAA-like poly(A) signal recognition. Notably, A-rich signal usage is suppressed in the WD40-repeat mutation but promoted in PPLPP-domain deficiency. However, fy mutations do not aggravate the altered signal usage in oxt6. Furthermore, the WD40-repeat mutation shows a preference for 39 untranslated region shortening, but the PPLPP-domain deficiency shows a preference for lengthening. Interestingly, the WD40-repeat mutant exhibits shortened primary roots and late flowering with alteration of APA of related genes. Importantly, the long transcripts of two APA genes affected in fy are related to abiotic stress responses. These results reveal a conserved and specific role of FY in mRNA polyadenylation.

TI  - Identification and Preservation of Arm Lymphatic System in Axillary Dissection for Breast Cancer to Reduce Arm Lymphedema Events: A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Controversy in axillary reverse mapping in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) possibly results from incomplete recognition of the arm lymphatic system (ALS) and its compromise to oncological safety. The iDEntification and Preservation of ARm lymphaTic system (DEPART) technique facilitates complete identification of ALS; therefore, its use may decrease the occurrence of arm lymphedema. This study aimed to examine the arm lymphedema rate, locoregional recurrence, and feasibility to perform DEPART in ALND. Methods Patients from February 2013 to October 2017 from two tertiary referral centers were randomly assigned to two groups. In the study group, indocyanine green and methylene blue (MB) were utilized to identify arm sentinel nodes, and 0.1 ml MB was injected into the arm sentinel nodes to reveal the subsequent-echelon nodes and lymphatics. Gross arm lymph nodes were examined by intraoperative partial frozen section and were removed if positive. Arm lymphedema, local recurrence, regional recurrence, and distant metastasis were recorded at different follow-up examinations. Results Arm sentinel nodes were identified in 573 (83.2%) patients. Subsequent-echelon nodes and lymphatics were visualized in 558 (97.4%) patients. Metastatic arm nodes were identified in 38 (6.8%) patients. The arm lymphedema rate was 3.3% (18/543) in the study group versus 15.3% (99/648) in the control group (p < 0.001) after 37-month median follow-up. Regional recurrence showed no difference between the two groups (1.4% and 1.2%, respectively) (p = 0.392). Conclusions DEPART can benefit breast cancer patients who undergo ALND, reducing the arm lymphedema rate without adversely affecting the morbidity of regional recurrence.

TI  - Variations in the lake area, water level, and water volume of Hongjiannao Lake during 1986-2018 based on Landsat and ASTER GDEM data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, 329 Landsat images combined with the Deeply Clear Water Extraction Index were applied to delineate boundaries of Hongjiannao Lake during 1986-2018. The net shoreline movement (NSM) and linear regression rate (LRR) achieved by Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) were employed to depict the distance and rate change of lake shorelines. Based on the waterline method and lake boundaries, the water levels were derived from ASTER GDEM V2. Water volume variations were evaluated using the combination of lake area and water level. The variations in Hongjiannao Lake can be grouped into three stages: (i) The lake area, water level, and volume variations slightly declined from 57.25 km(2), 1211.15 m, and - 0.0220 km(3) in 1986 to 56.36 km(2), 1210.66 m, and - 0.036 km(3) in 1997, respectively. The average degradation distance (NSM) and rate (LRR) of lake shorelines were 74.26 m and 3.48 m/a, respectively. Although these three aspects slightly decreased, they maintained a stable high level due to stability of natural factors. (ii) A rapid decrease in these three aspects during 1998-2015 was expressed by rates of - 1.15 km(2)/a (the total decrease was - 21.72 km(2)), - 0.18 m/a (the total decrease was - 3.45 m), and - 0.0068 km(3)/a (the total decrease was - 0.1419 km(3)), respectively. The average shrinkage distance (NSM) and rate (LRR) of lake boundaries were 1049.35 m and 55.00 m/a, respectively, and gradually intensifying human activities were the leading factor. (iii) These three aspects increased from 31.75 km(2), 1207.03 m, and - 0.1852 km(3) in 2016 to 36.19 km(2), 1207.23 m, and - 0.1883 km(3), respectively, in 2018. The average enlargement distance (NSM) and rate (LRR) of lake shorelines were 196.87 m and 67.85 m/a, respectively, mainly caused by closing of small mines, sluicing activities, and increase in annual precipitation.

TI  - The Concept "Honor" and Its Figurative Representations in the Bilingual Writer's Blended Worldview (Based on the Story "Honor" by R. Seisenbayev)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the concept "Honor" as an element of the Russian language worldview and the key concept of the creative blended worldview of the Kazakh bilingual writer Rollan Seisenbayev. The object of the analysis is the concept sphere of the story "Honor", the key element of which is the same-name concept expressed by a set of direct, figurative and symbolic representations at the lexical and narrative level of the text structure. The name of the concept is given in the title of the story, and its semantic content is realized at the level of ideological and artistic content through the system of characters, the event and fable structure, the chronotope, the author's idea of a piece of art. The aim of the article is to identify the universal core and the ethno-specific components of the artistic concept "Honor" that the Kazakh writer aesthetically objectified by by means of the Russian language. Based on the data of previous studies and encyclopedic and explanatory dictionaries' material, the general content of the concept under study is determined, its frame structure and the semantic field of its lexical and phraseological expression in modem Russian are modeled. The conceptual core of the concept "Honor" is an idea of the high-positive individual qualities demonstrated for society's benefit and inspiring public respect. The conceptual frame structure of the concept contains three slots, which correspond to three subframes: (1) `the person has high positive qualities (virtues)', (2) 'personal qualities correspond to the ideas of public welfare (ethical standards)', (3) 'society respects (honors) the person'. The associative-figurative aspect of the concept "Honor" is connected with the metaphorical way of its comprehension and verbalization, with its symbolic expression by means of culture signs (images, symbols, gestures, rituals). Honor is conceptualized through the "top - bottom" orientation metaphor, the "head/arms - foot" body metaphor, the ontological metaphor of a "precious object", a "whole - destroyed object", "pure/light - dirty/dark object". The figurative characteristic of honor presents the symbolism of a "monument", a "sword", a "horseman" as honor and power attributes, as well as action code symbols - gestures and facial expressions of superiority, honor, worship and humiliation. The creative blended worldview expressed by means of the Russian language describes the life, social and cultural lifestyle, mentality and spiritual aspirations of the Kazakhs of the early 18th century, reflects ideological views, ethical values, lifestyle and traditions of the Kazakh people. Universal content is complemented by such important national and historical-cultural meanings as family honor and military valor; while reducing the individual and dominating the collective aspects of honor notions. The situation of honor and dignity humiliation (desecrated honor) is actualized, which requires the restoration of justice: honor protection in battle (fair combat) or blood feud (barymta). The factors of honor and duty deviation such as vanity, pride, resentment, appetite for revenge are highlighted. The importance of such ethical and aesthetic categories as beauty, mercy, love and forgiveness are emphasized as the means of social relations harmonization.

TI  - A Hierarchical Airport Detection Method Using Spatial Analysis and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airports have a profound impact on our lives, and uncovering their distribution around the world has great significance for research and development. However, existing airport databases are incomplete and have a high cost of updating. Thus, a fast and automatic worldwide airport detection method can be of significance for global airport detection at regular intervals. However, previous airport detection studies are usually based on single remote sensing (RS) imagery, which seems an overwhelming burden for worldwide airport detection with traversal searching. Thus, we propose a hierarchical airport detection method consisting of broad-scale extraction of worldwide candidate airport regions based on spatial analysis of released RS products, including impervious surfaces from FROM-GLC10 (fine resolution observation and monitoring of global land cover 10) product, building distribution from OSMs (open street maps) and digital surface model from AW3D30 (ALOS World 3D-30 m). Moreover, narrow-scale aircraft detection was initially conducted by the Faster R-CNN (regional-convolutional neural networks) deep learning method. To avoid overestimation of background regions by Faster R-CNN, a second CNN classifier is used to refine the class labeling with negative samples. Specifically, our research focuses on target airports with at least 2 km length in three experimental regions. Results show that spatial analysis reduced the possible regions to 0.56% of the total area of 75,691 km(2). The initial aircraft detection by Faster R-CNN had a mean user's accuracy of 88.90% and ensured that all the aircrafts could be detected. Then, by introducing the CNN reclassifier, the user's accuracy of aircraft detection was significantly increased to 94.21%. Finally, through an experienced threshold of aircraft number, 19 of the total 20 airports were detected correctly. Our results reveal the overall workflow is reliable for automatic and rapid airport detection around the world with the help of released RS products. This research promotes the application and progression of deep learning.

TI  - Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Urban and Suburban Atmospheres in Central China: Spatiotemporal Patterns, Source Implications, and Health Risk Assessment
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) are hazardous air pollutants and the main precursors of ozone (O-3). In this study, the characteristics of ambient AHs were investigated at an urban site (Ziyang, ZY) and a suburban site (Jiangxia, JX) in Wuhan, Central China, in 2017. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was used to investigate the sources of AHs, and a health risk assessment was applied to estimate the effects of AHs on human health. The concentrations of total AHs at ZY (2048 +/- 1364 pptv) were comparable (p > 0.05) to that (2023 +/- 1015 pptv) at JX. Source apportionment results revealed that vehicle exhaust was the dominant source of both, total AHs, and toluene, contributing 51.9 +/- 13.1% and 49.3 +/- 9.5% at ZY, and 44.7 +/- 12.6% and 43.2 +/- 10.2% at JX, respectively. Benzene was mainly emitted from vehicle exhaust at ZY (50.2 +/- 15.5%), while it was mainly released from biomass and coal burning sources at JX (50.6 +/- 16.7%). The health risk assessment results indicated that AHs did not have a significant non-carcinogenic risk, while the carcinogenic risks of benzene exceeded the regulatory limits set by the USEPA for adults (1 x 10(-6)) at both sites. Hence, controlling the emissions of vehicular and biomass/coal burning sources will be an effective way to reduce ambient AHs and the health risk of benzene exposure in this region. These findings will enhance our knowledge of ambient AHs in Central China and be helpful for local governments to formulate air pollution control strategies.

TI  - Spatial variation of sources and photochemistry, of formaldehyde in Wuhan, Central China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2016, ambient formaldehyde (HCHO) and related parameters were measured simultaneously at a suburban site (Wujiashan, WJS), an urban site (Ziyang, ZY) and a roadside site (Hankou, HK) in Wuhan, Central China. The mixing ratios of HCHO at WJS (2.1 +/- 0.2 ppbv) were comparable (p > 0.05) to those at ZY (2.2 +/- 0.4 ppbv) and lower (p < 0.01) than those at HK (3.4 +/- 0.5 ppbv). Secondary formation made the greatest contributions to ambient HCHO at WJS (61.9 +/- 5.9%) and ZY (69.3 +/- 7.3%), while vehicle exhaust (i.e., diesel and CNG exhaust, gasoline exhaust) (47.2 10.4%) was the dominant HCHO source at HK. Vehicle exhaust was also the dominant primary source of HCHO at WJS and ZY, accounting for 16.0 +/- 4.0%, and 21.9 +/- 8.0%, respectively. Biogenic emissions made a non-negligible contribution at suburban site WJS (9.8 +/- 3.2%). The precursors of the secondary HCHO were investigated using a photochemical box model. Alkenes and aromatics were found to be the most important contributors to secondary HCHO. The impact of observed HCHO on the production of hydroperoxy radical (HO2) and ozone (O-3) were also assessed. The photochemical reactions of HCHO (i.e., the photolysis and OH-initiated oxidation of HCHO) accounted for 10.5 +/- 0.6%, 10.6 +/- 0.8% and 14.8 +/- 0.9% to the formation of HO2 at WJS, ZY and HK, respectively, and reducing HCHO led to a considerable decrease in O-3 formation. This study demonstrates the important roles of vehicle exhaust and secondary formation in the sources of HCHO, which have significant photochemical relevance. Attention should be paid to HCHO to control the photochemical pollution in Wuhan effectively.

TI  - Microphysical Characteristics of Precipitation during Pre-monsoon, Monsoon, and Post-monsoon Periods over the South China Sea
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Raindrop size distribution (RSD) characteristics over the South China Sea (SCS) are examined with onboard Parsivel disdrometer measurements collected during marine surveys from 2012 to 2016. The observed rainfall is divided into pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon periods based on the different large-scale circumstances. In addition to disdrometer data, sounding observation, FY-2E satellite, SPRINTARS (Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species), and NCEP reanalysis datasets are used to illustrate the dynamical and microphysical characteristics associated with the rainfall in different periods. Significant variations have been observed in respect of raindrops among the three periods. Intercomparison reveals that small drops (D < 1 mm) are prevalent during pre-monsoon precipitation, whereas medium drops (1-3 mm) are predominant in monsoon precipitation. Overall, the post-monsoon precipitation is characterized by the least concentration of raindrops among the three periods. But, several large raindrops could also occur due to severe convective precipitation events in this period. Classification of the precipitation into stratiform and convective regimes shows that the lg(N-w) value of convective rainfall is the largest (smallest) in the pre-monsoon (post-monsoon) period, whereas the D-m value is the smallest (largest) in the pre-monsoon (post-monsoon) period. An inversion relationship between the coefficient A and the exponential b of the Z-R relationships for precipitation during the three periods is found. Empirical relations between D-m and the radar reflectivity factors at Ku and Ka bands are also derived to improve the rainfall retrieval algorithms over the SCS. Furthermore, the possible causative mechanisms for the significant RSD variability in different periods are also discussed with respect to warm and cold rain processes, raindrop evaporation, convective activities, and other meteorological factors.

TI  - Inversion of organic matter content in wetland soil based on Landsat 8 remote sensing image
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using GF-1 and Landsat8 remote sensing images as data sources, combined with the experimental data of wetland soil sampling in Anyi County and Gao'an Research Area, the ability and difference of two remote sensing images in inversion of soil organic matter content were compared. The results show that the reflectivity of the two remote sensing images in the visible and near-infrared bands is significantly correlated with the soil organic matter content, and the correlation is the most in the near-infrared band. The index model established by the near-infrared band of GF-1 is more than the near-infrared band using Landsat8. The power model estimates slightly better. The multi-regression model established by introducing the blue band (dark blue band) and red band has higher inversion precision than the single-band model, especially the improvement effect of Landsat8 remote sensing image. Compared with Landsat8, GF-1 remote sensing image has higher spatial resolution and shorter revisit period, and has similar predictive ability in detecting soil organic matter content, which can replace Landsat8 remote sensing image.

TI  - A Geophysical Model Function for Wind Speed Retrieval From C-Band HH-Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is routinely acquired at HH-polarization in high-latitude areas for measuring surface wind over the ocean. However, in the contrary of VV-polarization, there is no HH-polarization geophysical model function (GMF) exists to directly retrieve wind speed from SAR images. In general, HH-polarized normalized radar cross section (NRCS) is thus converted into VV-polarization and then conventional CMOD functions are used with auxiliary wind direction information for wind speed retrieval. In this letter, we propose a new GMF for SAR ocean surface wind speed retrieval, called CMODH, which relates the C-band NRCS acquired at HH-polarization over the ocean, to the 10-m height wind speed, incident angle, and relative wind direction. We first use more than 220 000 ENVISAT ASAR radar backscatter measurements collocated with ASCAT winds to derive the CMODH coefficients. Subsequently, 1459 RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) and 428 Sentinel-1A/B (Sl-1A/B) HH-polarized SAR acquisitions under different wind speeds are matched to in situ buoy observations to validate CMODH. The statistical comparisons between SAR-observed and simulated NRCS show a bias of -0.07 dB and a root-mean-square error of 1.62 dB for RS-2, and -0.01 dB and 2.48 dB for S1-1A/B. These results suggest that the proposed CMODH has the potential to directly retrieve ocean surface wind speeds using C-band SAR images acquired at HH-polarization, with no need for NRCS transformation by using various empirical and theoretical polarization ratio models.

TI  - Synergistic Modern Global 1 Km Cropland Dataset Derived from Multi-Sets of Land Cover Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of global cropland products could affect our understanding of the impacts of cropland reclamation on global changes. With the advancement of remote sensing technology, several global land cover products and synergistic datasets have been developed in recent decades. However, there are still some disagreements among the global cropland datasets. In this paper, we proposed a new synergistic method that integrates the reliability of spatial distribution and cropland fraction on a pixel scale, and developed a modern (around 2000 C.E.) fractional cropland dataset with a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution on the basis of the spatial consistency of cropland reclamation intensity derived from multi-sets of global land cover products. The main conclusions are shown as follows: (1) The accuracy of spatial distribution assessed by validation samples in this synergistic dataset reaches 87.6%, and the dataset also has a moderate amount of cropland pixels when compared with other products. (2) The reliability of cropland fraction on the pixel scale had been highly improved, and most cropland pixel has a higher fraction (over 90%) in this dataset. The "L" shape of the histogram of pixel numbers with different reclamation intensities is reasonable because it is consistent with the up-scaling results derived from satellite-derived products with high spatial resolutions and the expert knowledge on cultivation. (3) The cropland areas in this non-calibrated result are generally closer to that of FAOSTAT on scales from global to national when compared to other non-calibrated synergistic datasets and original satellite-derived products. (4) The reliability of the synergistic result developed by this method might be decreased to some degree in the regions with high discrepancies among the original multi-sets of cropland datasets.

TI  - Using Neural Network to Identify the Severity of Wheat <i>Fusarium</i> Head Blight in the Field Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most important diseases of wheat, mainly occurs in the ear. Given that the severity of the disease cannot be accurately identified, the cost of pesticide application increases every year, and the agricultural ecological environment is also polluted. In this study, a neural network (NN) method was proposed based on the red-green-blue (RGB) image to segment wheat ear and disease spot in the field environment, and then to determine the disease grade. Firstly, a segmentation dataset of single wheat ear was constructed to provide a benchmark for the segmentation of the wheat ear. Secondly, a segmentation model of single wheat ear based on the fully convolutional network (FCN) was established to effectively realize the segmentation of the wheat ear in the field environment. An FHB segmentation algorithm was proposed based on a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) with K-means clustering of the improved artificial bee colony (IABC) to segment the diseased spot of wheat ear by automatic optimization of PCNN parameters. Finally, the disease grade was calculated using the ratio of the disease spot to the whole wheat ear. The experimental results show that: (1) the accuracy of the segmentation model for single wheat ear constructed in this study is 0.981. The segmentation time is less than 1 s, indicating that the model can quickly and accurately segment wheat ear in the field environment; (2) the segmentation method of the disease spot performed under each evaluation indicator is improved compared with the traditional segmentation methods, and the accuracy is 0.925 in the disease severity identification. These research results can provide important reference value for grading wheat FHB in the field environment, which also can be beneficial for real-time monitoring of other crops' diseases under near-Earth remote sensing.

TI  - Dynamic drought risk assessment for maize based on crop simulation model and multi-source drought indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is a globally impacted natural disaster for the rain-fed agriculture region. The aim of this study is to construct a dynamic drought risk assessment (DDRA) model of maize for different growth periods based on risk assessment theory. In this model, optimal drought hazard indices for maize of the four growth stages were selected among 11 time scales daily Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, Precipitation Condition Index, Soil Moisture Condition Index, Vegetation Condition Index, and Optimized Vegetation Drought Index. Secondly, the CERES-Maize model was used to fit the physical vulnerability curves with their corresponding drought hazards indices. DDRA model of maize in Jilin Province, China during 1981-2014 was conducted based on in situ data, remote sensing data, and field experiments data. The maize drought risk series maps were drawn and the results showed that the risk value under same hazard level presented an increasing trend at emergence-jointing and jointing-heading stage, and had a slight decreasing trend at heading-milky and milky-mature stage. For spatial dimension, the high drought risk value was distributed in the west and middle region. During the last three growth periods, the high risk value areas increased gradually from northwest to southeast region. The results indicated that the DDRA model provides more accurate evaluation in both the time and spatial scale and has significant guidance value for improving the adaptability of agricultural drought risk.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation in grassland degradation and its main drivers, based on biomass: Case study in the Altay Prefecture, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics and identifying of main factors that drive grassland degradation are essential for formulating ecological restoration measures for grassland. In this study, we addressed two main scientific questions: (1) how to accurately characterize the spatial and temporal variability in grassland degradation; and (2) how to identify the dominant factors that affect grassland degradation. Based on the data obtained from 270 field sampling points (912 quadrats) and MODIS, we selected the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), vegetation coverage ( VC), biomass and ecosystem service values (ESVs) to study the degradation of grassland in Altay Prefecture, China. From 2000 to 2016, the area with decrease in TVDI accounted for 93.4% of the total grassland. The VC values in the warm steppe and mountain meadow areas decreased by 5.3% and 1.6%, respectively, and the biomass decreased by 80% and 76.4% in these areas. Compared with 2000-2005, the mean total ESVs decreased by 5.1% in 2011-2016, where the reductions in the ESVs for warm steppe and mountain meadow accounted for 54.3% and 38% of the total reduction, respectively. The results showed that the degradation trends were more significant in the warm steppe and mountain meadow than the other land types. These findings improve our understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of grassland degradation. Human disturbance was the main factor responsible for grassland degradation in Altay Prefecture, according to the framework developed in this study based on biomass and TVDI metrics. Our results provide a reference for characterizing the spatio-temporal variability of grassland degradation by combining statistical and spatial analyses, as well as a simple framework for application in similar regions to analyze the effects of climate change and human disturbance on grassland degradation.

TI  - Random cross-observation intensity consistency method for large-scale SAR images mosaics: An example of Gaofen-3 SAR images covering China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale microwave remote sensing research requires multiple synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image mosaics. However, owing to multiple factors, different SAR images frequently exhibit intensity differences. This leads to poor intensity continuity after mosaicking, making SAR image interpretation extremely difficult. The existing method assumes that SAR images have been subject to strict radiometric calibration and mainly focuses on intensity balancing to minimize the intensity difference between adjacent images. This method is not effective when the intensity difference between SAR images is large. In this paper, a novel random cross-observation intensity consistency (RCOIC) algorithm is proposed to eliminate the intensity differences for SAR image mosaics. The proposed algorithm is based on global intensity constraints. First, source images are downsampled. Then, the gain correction coefficients of each image in a study area are accurately estimated through random cross-observation. Further, multi-view local intensity correction of each image in the study area is performed using the overlapping areas of adjacent images, and a low-resolution intensity reference map covering the study area is generated. Finally, the intensities of high-resolution source images are corrected by constructing local independent linear models of images based on the low-resolution intensity reference map. Gaofen-3 satellite images with large ranges and large time differences, covering most of China's land area, were selected to test the effect of the newly developed algorithm. After processing, the overall visual effect was good after mosaicking, the intensity transitions at the edges of the images were smooth, the intensity distributions corresponded better to actual ground objects, and the statistical result of adjacent images overlapping regions was good. This validates the reliability of the algorithm.

TI  - Constraints on the resistivity of the oceanic lithosphere and asthenosphere from seafloor ocean tidal electromagnetic measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The electromagnetic (EM) field generated by ocean tidal flow is readily detectable in both satellite magnetic field data, and in ocean-bottom measurements of electric and magnetic fields. The availability of accurate charts of tidal currents, constrained by assimilation of modern satellite altimetry data, opens the possibility of using tidal EM fields as a source to image mantle electrical resistivity beneath the ocean basins, as highlighted by the recent success in defining the globally averaged lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) with satellite data. In fact, seafloor EM data would be expected to provide better constraints on the structure of resistive oceanic lithosphere, since the toroidal magnetic mode, which can constrain resistive features, is a significant component of the tidal EM field within the ocean, but is absent above the surface (in particular in satellite data). Here we consider this issue in more detail, using a combination of simplified theoretical analysis and 1-D and 3-D numerical modelling to provide a thorough discussion of the sensitivity of satellite and seafloor data to subsurface electrical structure. As part of this effort, and as a step toward 3-D inversion of seafloor tidal data, we have developed a new flexible 3-D spherical-coordinate finite difference scheme for both global and regional scale modelling, with higher resolution models nested in larger scale solutions. We use the new 3-D model, together with Monte Carlo simulations of errors in tidal current estimates, to provide a quantitative assessment of errors in the computed tidal EM signal caused by uncertainty in the tidal source. Over the open ocean this component of error is below 0.01 nT in B-z at satellite height and 0.05 nT in B-x on the seafloor, well below typical signal levels. However, as coastlines are approached error levels can increase substantially. Both analytical and 3-D modelling demonstrate that the seafloor magnetic field is most sensitive to the lithospheric resistance (the product of resistivity and thickness), and is more weakly influenced (primarily in the phase) by resistivity of the underlying asthenosphere. Satellite data, which contain only the poloidal magnetic mode, are more sensitive to the conductive asthenosphere, but have little sensitivity to lithospheric resistance. For both seafloor and satellite data's changes due to plausible variations in Earth parameters are well above error levels associated with source uncertainty, at least in the ocean interior. Although the 3-D modelling results are qualitatively consistent with theoretical analysis, the presence of coastlines and bathymetric variations generates a complex response, confirming that quantitative interpretation of ocean tidal EM fields will require a 3-D treatment. As an illustration of the nested 3-D scheme, seafloor data at five magnetic and seven electric stations in the northeastern Pacific (41 degrees N, 165 degrees W) are fit with trial-and-error forward modelling of a local domain. The simulation results indicate that the lithospheric resistance is roughly 7 x 10(8) Omega m(2). The phase of the seafloor data in this region are inconsistent with a sharp transition between the resistive lithosphere and conductive asthenosphere.

TI  - Ocean Response to Successive Typhoons Sarika and Haima (2016) Based on Data Acquired via Multiple Satellites and Moored Array
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) are natural disasters for coastal regions. TCs with maximum wind speeds higher than 32.7 m/s in the north-western Pacific are referred to as typhoons. Typhoons Sarika and Haima successively passed our moored observation array in the northern South China Sea in 2016. Based on the satellite data, the winds (clouds and rainfall) biased to the right (left) sides of the typhoon tracks. Sarika and Haima cooled the sea surface similar to 4 and similar to 2 degrees C and increased the salinity similar to 1.2 and similar to 0.6 psu, respectively. The maximum sea surface cooling occurred nearly one day after the two typhoons. Station 2 (S2) was on left side of Sarika's track and right side of Haima's track, which is studied because its data was complete. Strong near-inertial currents from the ocean surface toward the bottom were generated at S2, with a maximum mixed-layer speed of similar to 80 cm/s. The current spectrum also shows weak signal at twice the inertial frequency (2f). Sarika deepened the mixed layer, cooled the sea surface, but warmed the subsurface by similar to 1 degrees C. Haima subsequently pushed the subsurface warming anomaly into deeper ocean, causing a temperature increase of similar to 1.8 degrees C therein. Sarika and Haima successively increased the heat content anomaly upper than 160 m at S2 to similar to 50 and similar to 100 m degrees C, respectively. Model simulation of the two typhoons shows that mixing and horizontal advection caused surface ocean cooling, mixing and downwelling caused subsurface warming, while downwelling warmed the deeper ocean. It indicates that Sarika and Haima sequentially modulated warm water into deeper ocean and influenced internal ocean heat budget. Upper ocean salinity response was similar to temperature, except that rainfall refreshed sea surface and caused a successive salinity decrease of similar to 0.03 and similar to 0.1 psu during the two typhoons, changing the positive subsurface salinity anomaly to negative

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Capon's minimum-variance method (MVM) and amplitude and phase estimation (APES) spectral estimation algorithms can be applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing to improve the resolution and suppress sidelobe levels. In this paper, we use Capon-/APES-based SAR reprocessing algorithms to increase the persistent scatterer (PS) density in PS interferometry (PSI). We propose a PS candidate (PSC) selection algorithm applicable to the superresolution reprocessed images and the corresponding processing chain. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by a number of simulations and a stack of TerraSAR-X data. The results show that the Capon algorithm outperforms others in PSC selection. We present a full PSI time-series analysis on the PSCs extracted from the Capon-reprocessed stacks. The results show that the PS density is increased between 50% and 60%, while their interferometric quality is maintained.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass of <i>Pinus densata</i>-dominated forests using Landsat time series and permanent sample plot data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Southwest China is one of three major forest regions in China and plays an important role in carbon sequestration. Accurate estimations of changes in aboveground biomass are critical for understanding forest carbon cycling and promoting climate change mitigation. Southwest China is characterized by complex topographic features and forest canopy structures, complicating methods for mapping aboveground biomass and its dynamics. The integration of continuous Landsat images and national forest inventory data provides an alternative approach to develop a long-term monitoring program of forest aboveground biomass dynamics. This study explores the development of a methodological framework using historical national forest inventory plot data and Landsat TM time-series images. This method was formulated by comparing two parametric methods: Linear Regression for Multiple Independent Variables (MLR), and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR); and two nonparametric methods: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) based on the state of forest aboveground biomass and change models. The methodological framework mapped Pinus densata aboveground biomass and its changes over time in Shangri-la, Yunnan, China. Landsat images and national forest inventory data were acquired for 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007. The results show that: (1) correlation and homogeneity texture measures were able to characterize forest canopy structures, aboveground biomass and its dynamics; (2) GBRT and RF predicted Pinus densata aboveground biomass and its changes better than PLSR and MLR; (3) GBRT was the most reliable approach in the estimation of aboveground biomass and its changes; and, (4) the aboveground biomass change models showed a promising improvement of prediction accuracy. This study indicates that the combination of GBRT state and change models developed using temporal Landsat and national forest inventory data provides the potential for developing a methodological framework for the long-term mapping and monitoring program of forest aboveground biomass and its changes in Southwest China.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration for Multiple Sensors with the Moon as an Intermediate Reference
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The instrument cross-calibration is an effective way to assess the quality of satellite data. In this study, a new method is proposed to cross-calibrate the sensors among satellite instruments by using a RObotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model and Apollo sample reflectance in reflective solar bands (RSBs). The ROLO model acts as a transfer radiometer to bridge between the instruments. The reflective spectrum of the Apollo sample is used to compensate for the difference in the instrument's relative spectral responses (RSRs). In addition, the double ratio between the observed lunar irradiance and the simulated lunar irradiance is used to reduce the difference in instrument lunar viewing and illumining geometry. This approach is applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on board three satellites, respectively. The mean difference between MODIS and SeaWiFS is less than 3.14%, and the difference between MODIS and ALI is less than 4.75%. These results indicate that the proposed cross-calibration method not only compensates for the RSR mismatches but also reduces the differences in lunar observation geometry. Thus, radiance calibration of any satellite instrument can be validated with a reference instrument bridged by the moon.

TI  - Variability of Major Aerosol Types in China Classified Using AERONET Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol type is a critical piece of information in both aerosol forcing estimation and passive satellite remote sensing. However, the major aerosol types in China and their variability is still less understood. This work uses direct sun measurements and inversion derived parameters from 47 sites within the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in China, with more than 39,000 records obtained between April 1998 and January 2017, to identify dominant aerosol types using two independent methods, namely, K means and Self Organizing Map (SOM). In total, we define four aerosol types, namely, desert dust, scattering mixed, absorbing mixed and scattering fine, based on their optical and microphysical characteristics. Seasonally, dust aerosols mainly occur in the spring and over North and Northwest China; scattering mixed are more common in the spring and summer, whereas absorbing aerosols mostly occur in the autumn and winter during heating period, and scattering fine aerosols have their highest occurrence frequency in summer over East China. Based on their spatial and temporal distribution, we also generate seasonal aerosol type maps that can be used for passive satellite retrieval. Compared with the global models used in most satellite retrieval algorithms, the unique feature of East Asian aerosols is the curved single scattering albedo spectrum, which could be related to the mixing of black carbon with dust or organic aerosols.

TI  - Estimation of forest vegetation carbon storage in Hunan Province, China based on <i>k</i>-NN method and domestic high-resolution data
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - To promote the application of domestic high-resolution satellite data in large-scale carbon storage estimation and measurement, a total of 206 high-resolution remote sensing images covering Hunan Province were used as the data source, and the estimated minimum unit was fixed as a 0.06 hm(2) square composed of multiple pixels. Through the establishment and purification of the interpretation marks, in the extraction of forest information, the pixel-based method and object-oriented classification method were used to compare. In the estimation of carbon storage of arbor forest, the robust estimate, partial least squares method and k-NN estimate were used to compare. Finally, we estimated forest carbon storage in Hunan Province and generated the distribution map of carbon density levels. The results showed that the interpretation mark based on the automatic extraction of plots could increase the extraction accuracy of arbor forest after purification. For the estimation of forest carbon storage at large-scale, the k-NN algorithm embodied a large advantage in fkifest infkifmation extraction and arbor forest carbon storage modeling. The average classification accuracy of the 206 scene images was 76.8%, the average RMSE was 8.95 t . hm(-2), the average RRMSE was 19.1%, and the total carbon stock in Hunan Province was 22.28 Mt. The results provided effective reference a for the estimation and measurement of forest carbon storage at the provincial and national scales.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass in subtropical forests of China by integrating multisource remote sensing and ground data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The biomass of the subtropical forests of China is an important component of the global carbon cycle. Recently, several above ground biomass (AGB) maps have been produced using a variety of approaches to assess the carbon stock of the subtropical forest in China. However, due to the lack of reliable ground observations and the limitations of AGB mapping methods at regional scales, estimates of the spatial distribution of AGB vary greatly, leading to large uncertainties in the carbon stock estimations. In this study, we produced a new 1-km spatial resolution AGB map by synthesizing an unprecedented number of ground AGB observations from published studies, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of ground observations, MODIS data, forest cover/gain/loss maps based on Landsat, GLAS forest canopy height, and climatic and terrain data. In addition, we validated our estimates using independent testing data and compared our estimates with three previous AGB maps. The results indicate that the total AGB stock in the subtropical forest of China is (266 +/- 9.1) x 10(6) Mg, with an average AGB of 123.2 Mg/ha. Based on sixteen explanatory variables, our ensemble mean model explains 75% of the variance in forest AGB, with an RMSE of 45.5 Mg/ha. Comparison using all observation data shows that our map has a significantly lower RMSE and bias than previous maps, where the RMSE and bias tended to vary with forest type. This study not only improved the accuracy of AGB estimation for the subtropical forests but also highlighted the importance of forest type for regional AGB estimation.

TI  - Improved Assimilation of Fengyun-3 Satellite-Based Snow Cover Fraction in Northeastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilation of snow cover is an important method to improve the accuracy of snow simulation. However, the effects of snow assimilation are poor because satellite observed snow cover data contain erroneous information, such as cloud contamination. In this paper, an improved approach is proposed to reduce the effects of observational errors during assimilation of snow cover fraction acquired by the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellite in northeastern China. A snow depth constraint was imposed on quality control of a snow depth product from a microwave radiation imager. The assimilation experiments were carried out before and after quality control (denoted as SCFDA and SCFDA_WSD, respectively). The snow cover fraction results were evaluated against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products. When assimilating the snow cover fraction with the snow depth constraint (i.e., SCFDA_WSD), substantially larger improvement was obtained than that without such a constraint/quality control (SCFDA), and the deviation and root mean square error of the snow cover fraction were significantly reduced. The assimilation performance was also evaluated against in-situ snow depth observations. The SCFDA_WSD also showed greater improvements during the snow accumulation and snowmelt periods than the SCFDA. The SCFDA_WSD improvements in woodland and shrubland were the most obvious. At different altitudes, the effects of the SCFDA_WSD were basically equivalent, and the deeper the snow depth was, the better the effect. In addition, the SCFDA_WSD method was found in close agreement with the observations during a sudden snowfall event.

TI  - <i>In vivo</i> irreversible albumin-binding near-infrared dye conjugate as a naked-eye and fluorescence dual-mode imaging agent for lymph node tumor metastasis diagnosis
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor metastases account for about 90% of cancer-related death, among which lymphatic metastases play a pivotal role. Therefore, high-efficiency sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification is significant for lymph node (LN) metastasis diagnosis in clinic. Herein, a novel in vivo covalent albumin-binding near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent IR820-maleimide conjugate (IR-Mal) is firstly designed as a SLN dual-mode imaging agent. The IR-Mal conjugate exhibits bright blue appearance and its large Stokes shift (over 100 nm) increases the fluorescent imaging resolution effectively. The fluorescence intensity of covalent albumin-binding IR-Mal (BSA-IR-Mal) complex is considerably stronger than that of IR-Mal. In vivo, IR-Mal could rapidly covalently bind the tissue interstitial albumin following subcutaneous administration and BSA-IR-Mal complexes could specifically accumulate on LN, and detect both normal and metastatic SLN through naked-eye and fluorescence imaging with high resolution. Moreover, the light stability and enhanced fluorescence intensity of BSA-IR-Mal complex facilitates its diagnosis accuracy. These findings suggest that such in vivo irreversible albumin-binding fluorescence conjugates could serve as a new agent for dual-mode imaging and have a great potential to be applied in the SLNs imaging and diagnosis.

TI  - New Global View of Above-Cloud Absorbing Aerosol Distribution Based on CALIPSO Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-low-level-cloud aerosols (ACAs) have gradually gained more interest in recent years; however, the combined aerosol-cloud radiation effects are not well understood. The uncertainty about the radiative effects of aerosols above cloud mainly stems from the lack of comprehensive and accurate retrieval of aerosols and clouds for ACA scenes. In this study, an improved ACA identification and retrieval methodology was developed to provide a new global view of the ACA distribution by combining three-channel CALIOP (The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) observations. The new method can reliably identify and retrieve both thin and dense ACA layers, providing consistent results between the day- and night-time retrieval of ACAs. Then, new four-year (2007 to 2010) global ACA datasets were built, and new seasonal mean views of global ACA occurrence, optical depth, and geometrical thickness were presented and analyzed. Further discussion on the relative position of ACAs to low clouds showed that the mean distance between the ACA layer and the low cloud deck over the tropical Atlantic region is less than 0.2 km. This indicates that the ACAs over this region are more likely to be mixed with low-level clouds, thereby possibly influencing the cloud microphysics over this region, contrary to findings reported from previous studies. The results not only help us better understand global aerosol transportation and aerosol-cloud interactions but also provide useful information for model evaluation and improvements.

TI  - Prediction of landscape pattern changes in a coastal river basin in south-eastern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different landscapes in a river basin make different contributions to non-point source pollution according to the source-sink theory. Changes in landscape pattern have a considerable impact on river water quality. Precise predictions of the future landscape pattern provide strong support for manipulating land use patterns, which is beneficial for sustainable development in the watershed. The Jiulong River Basin in south-eastern China was selected as the study area. The Random Forest classifier, which combined textural characteristics with spectral information, was applied to interpret the landscapes from Landsat images acquired in 1995, 2005 and 2015 in this paper. The overall classification accuracy reached 86%, and the Kappa index was higher than 0.83, which was better than the accuracy of classifiers based on the exclusive use of spectral information. We used a hybrid cellular automaton-Markov (CA-Markov) model to simulate the landscape pattern of the Jiulong River Basin in 2015 and verified the accuracy according to the interpreted landscape classification map in 2015. The pixels that were predicted to the correct landscape account for 88.35% of total pixels, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.88, indicating that the CA-Markov model was credible for predicting the future landscape pattern in the Jiulong River Basin. The CA-Markov model was applied to forecast the landscape pattern of this watershed in 2025, and the transition area matrix from 2015 to 2025 was obtained. The predicted results demonstrated the imbalanced migration of source-sink landscapes in the future, which indicated the deterioration of water quality in the study area. Hence, government regulators need rational manipulation of the landscape pattern for sustainable development in the Jiulong River Basin.

TI  - Current and future mudflat losses in the southern Huanghe Delta due to coastal hard structures and shoreline retreat
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands, especially broad mudflats, are facing an unprecedented crisis due to combined influence of intensified coastal development activities, drastic river sediment reduction and rapid relative sea level rise. However, it is still a huge challenge to accurately assess the evolution of mudflats for the lack of reliable shoreline indicators on satellite images, especially the indicators for shoreline at low tide. This study, based on instantaneous shoreline positions derived from 430 Landsat satellite images during 1983-2019, uses sea level correction and statistical analysis methods to study the evolution of Laizhou Mudflat, and the intertidal mudflat loss in Laizhou Mudflat was accurately assessed and the effects of multiple factors, especially the effects of various coastal hard structures, on the evolution of Laizhou Mudflat were quantitatively estimated for the first time. The results show that the intertidal mudflat loss caused by the construction of cofferdams was 98 km(2), 93% of the total intertidal mudflat loss. Although the previous intertidal mudflat loss caused by shore-parallel structures was less, the shore-parallel structures will cause great mudflat loss in the future, and the broad Laizhou Mudflat will disappear in 110 years owing to the barrier effect of the widespread shore-parallel structures if the current rapid shoreline retreat is not improved. The construction of shore-normal structures can slow the shoreline retreat of adjacent mudflat but accelerate downstream shoreline retreat. As far as coastal protection is concerned, the construction of shore-normal structures in Laizhou Mudflat is inadvisable. Diverting 13 M ton/year of Huanghe sediment can totally offset the mudflat loss on the upstream of Dongying Pier, however, the mudflat located on the downstream of Dongying Pier is hard to restore owing to the block effect of the shore-normal structures to the alongshore transported sediment. Another option is demolishing the shore-parallel structures to recover the landward movement of shoreline, avoiding the mudflat loss at the expense of land loss.

TI  - Combining Data from Multiple Sources to Evaluate Spatial Variations in the Economic Costs of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-Related Health Conditions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, is closely related to a range of adverse health outcomes and ultimately imposes a high economic cost on the society. While we know that the costs associated with PM2.5-related health outcomes are not uniform geographically, a few researchers have considered the geographical variations in these costs because of a lack of high-resolution data for PM2.5 and population density. Satellite remote sensing provides highly precise, high-resolution data about how PM2.5 and population density vary spatially, which can be used to support detailed health-related assessments. In this study, we used high-resolution PM2.5 concentration and population density based on remote sensing data to assess the effects of PM2.5 on human health and the related economic costs in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in 2016 using exposure-response functions and the relationship between health and economic costs. The results showed that the PM2.5-related economic costs were unevenly distributed and as with the population density, the costs were mainly concentrated in urban areas. In 2016, the economic costs of PM2.5-related health endpoints amounted to 4.47% of the total gross domestic product in the BTH region. Of the health endpoints, the cost incurred by premature deaths accounted for more than 80% of the total economic costs associated with PM2.5. The results of this study provide new and detailed information that could be used to support the implementation of national and regional policies to reduce air pollution.
