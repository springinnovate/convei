TI  - Gap-Filling of 8-Day Terra MODIS Daytime Land Surface Temperature in High-Latitude Cold Region with Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter driving the dynamics of the thermal state on land surface. In high-latitude cold region, a long-term, stable LST product is of great importance in examining the distribution and degradation of permafrost under pressure of global warming. In this study, a generalized additive model (GAM) approach was developed to fill the missing pixels of the MODIS/Terra 8-day Land Surface Temperature (MODIS LST) daytime products with the ERA5 Land Skin Temperature (ERA5ST) dataset in a high-latitude watershed in Eurasia. Comparison at valid pixels revealed that the MODIS LST was 4.8-13.0 degrees C higher than ERA5ST, which varies with land covers and seasons. The GAM models fairly explained the LST differences between the two products from multiple covariates including satellite-extracted environmental variables (i.e., normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference snow index (NDSI) as well as locational information. Considering the dramatic seasonal variation of vegetation and frequent snow in the cold region, the gap-filling was conducted in two seasons. The results revealed the root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.7 degrees C and 3.4 degrees C between the valid MODIS LST and GAM-simulated LST data in the growing season and snowing season, respectively. By including the satellite-extracted land surface information in the GAM model, localized variations of land surface temperature that are often lost in the reanalysis data were effectively compensated. Specifically, land surface wetness (NDWI) was found to be the greatest contributor to explaining the differences between the two products. Vegetation (NDVI) was useful in the growing season and snow cover (NDSI) cannot be ignored in the snow season of the study region. The km-scale gap-filled MODIS LST products provide spatially and temporally continuous details that are useful for monitoring permafrost degradation in cold regions in scenarios of global climate change.

TI  - An observational and modeling study of a sea fog event over the yellow and east China seas on 17 March 2014
T2  - TROPICAL CYCLONE RESEARCH AND REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery, weather charts, objectively reanalyzed data, the observational data and station sounding data were analyzed to investigate a sea fog event occurred over the Yellow and East China Seas on March 17, 2014. The sounding profiles, weather situations and the related meteorological factors during the development and dissipation stages of this sea fog event were documented. Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model was applied to simulate this sea fog case. The simulated horizontal atmospheric visibility, cloud water, humidity, and vertical wind profile during the different stages of this fog event were analyzed. During the development stage of this sea fog, a southerly lower-jet with 16-18 ms-1, an inversion layer and a cold center over the Yellow Sea were detected. The relative humidity in the fog area was above 95%. The specific humidity over the East China Sea was higher than that over the Yellow Sea. Southerly was dominated in fog area. However, during the dissipation stage of this sea fog, westerly replaced the southerly and at the lower level, southerly jet disappeared. A dry air area formed over the Shandong Peninsula and moved eastwards. Moreover, the WRF modeling result showed that the simulated atmospheric horizontal visibility and cloud water were approximately consistent with the MODIS satellite imagery. Most of cloud water concentrated below 200-400 m, and the cloud water in the southern part of fog area extended to a higher height than the northern part. While both of air temperature and dew-point temperature were close to sea surface temperature. (C) 2021 The Shanghai Typhoon Institute of China Meteorological Administration.

T2  - Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The sustainable use of medicinal plants is the foundation of the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) and the acquisition of information on medicinal plants is the basis for the development of TCM. The traditional methods of investigating medicinal plant resources are disadvantageous in strong subjectivity and poor timeliness, making it difficult to real-time monitor medicinal plant resources. In recent years, remote sensing technology has become an important means of obtaining information on medicinal plants. The application of this technology has made up for the shortcomings of traditional methods. The open-access remote sensing data with medium spatial resolution satellites provide an opportunity for extracting information on medicinal plant resources. This study firstly introduced the principles of remote sensing technology, summarized the satellites and the parameters commonly used in the field of medicinal plant resources, and compared the survey methods of remote sensing technology with traditional methods. Secondly, it reviewed the applications of remote sensing technology in the extraction of information on the cultivation of medicinal plants and the common methods for extracting the planting structure information of medicinal plants based on remote sensing technology. Thirdly, the applications of remote sensing technology in the investigation and monitoring of medicinal plants were further analyzed with the research objects divided into wild and cultivated medicinal plants according to the characteristics of the habitats. Finally, it pointed out the key unsolved technical problems in the remote sensing monitoring of medicinal plant resources, and proposed solutions for the intelligent information processing of medicinal plants based on remote sensing big data, which is expected to provide references for the development of remote sensing technology in derivative application in medicinal plant resources.

TI  - Scattering Enhanced Attention Pyramid Network for Aircraft Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a challenging task because of the discreteness, variability, and interference of aircraft scattering features. This article proposes a new hybrid approach of scattering information enhancement (SIE) and an attention pyramid network (APN). It first extracts strong scattering points (SSPs) of aircraft via an adapted Harris-Laplace detector. These SSPs are then clustered into candidate scattering regions by density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and are then modeled with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Target scattering clusters are discriminated from background clutter by measuring the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to the known target templates. These target scattering clusters are enhanced in the preprocessing stage. All the SIE-preprocessed images are then fed into the APN for training and testing. It is composed of the multiscale feature pyramid network (FPN) and the modified convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to cope with the discreteness and variability of aircraft. In addition, focal loss (FL) is adopted to deal with the issue of unbalanced sample distribution and the interference from hard samples. Experiments conducted on the Gaofen-3 and TerraSAR-X data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with an average precision (AP) of 83.25%.

TI  - Lithological mapping using EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral data and semisupervised self-learning method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data have been widely used in lithological identification and mapping. In existing studies, sufficient training samples are required. However, collecting sufficient labeled training samples for lithological classification in remote and inaccessible areas is generally time consuming, expensive, and even hard to implement, which causes the insufficient training sample problems in lithological classification using hyperspectral data. The semisupervised self-learning (SSL) method provides an alternative way of addressing this ill-posed problem by enlarging the training set from unlabeled samples using the limited labeled samples as a priori. This study evaluates and analyzes the SSL method in lithological mapping using EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral image over a remote area. The performance of SSL with limited training samples was validated by comparing with multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) classification using full training samples. The experimental results indicate that SSL method with limited training samples can produce results comparable with the MLR with all the training samples and better results than those of the RF with all the training samples. Therefore, the SSL method provides a useful way for hyperspectral lithological mapping with limited training samples over remote and inaccessible areas.

TI  - Development of a New Phenology Algorithm for Fine Mapping of Cropping Intensity in Complex Planting Areas Using Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropping intensity is a key indicator for evaluating grain production and intensive use of cropland. Timely and accurately monitoring of cropping intensity is of great significance for ensuring national food security and improving the level of national land management. In this study, we used all Sentinel-2 images on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, and constructed an improved peak point detection method to extract the cropping intensity of a heterogeneous planting area combined with crop phenology. The crop growth cycle profiles were extracted from the multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface water index (LSWI) datasets. Results show that by 2020, the area of single cropping, double cropping, and triple cropping in the Henan Province are 52,236.9 km(2), 74,334.1 km(2), and 1927.1 km(2), respectively; the corresponding producer accuracies are 86.12%, 93.72%, and 91.41%, respectively; the corresponding user accuracies are 88.99%, 92.29%, and 71.26%, respectively. The overall accuracy is 90.95%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.81. Using the sown area in the statistical yearbook data of cities in the Henan Province to verify the extraction results of this paper, the R-2 is 0.9717, and the root mean square error is 1715.9 km(2). This study shows that using all the Sentinel-2 data, the phenology algorithm, and cloud computing technology has great potential in producing a high spatio-temporal resolution dataset for crop remote sensing monitoring and agricultural policymaking in complex planting areas.

TI  - A Deep Fusion uNet for Mapping Forests at Tree Species Levels with Multi-Temporal High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is critical to acquire the information of forest type at the tree species level due to its strong links with various quantitative and qualitative indicators in forest inventories. The efficiency of deep-learning classification models for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing image has been demonstrated with the ongoing development of artificial intelligence technology. However, due to limited statistical separability and complicated circumstances, completely automatic and highly accurate forest type mapping at the tree species level remains a challenge. To deal with the problem, a novel deep fusion uNet model was developed to improve the performance of forest classification refined at the dominant tree species level by combining the beneficial phenological characteristics of the multi-temporal imagery and the powerful features of the deep uNet model. The proposed model was built on a two-branch deep fusion architecture with the deep Res-uNet model functioning as its backbone. Quantitative assessments of China's Gaofen-2 (GF-2) HSR satellite data revealed that the suggested model delivered a competitive performance in the Wangyedian forest farm, with an overall classification accuracy (OA) of 93.30% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.9229. The studies also yielded good results in the mapping of plantation species such as the Chinese pine and the Larix principis.

TI  - Mapping Atmospheric Exposure of the Intertidal Zone with Sentinel-1 CSAR in Northern Norway
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertidal zone (ITZ) is a highly dynamic and diverse coastal ecosystem under pressure that provides important eco-services. Being periodically under water makes it challenging to monitor, and the only possibility to map it in all tidal stages is by using dense time series of observations. At high latitudes, the Sentinel-1 (S1) constellation of the European Copernicus Program consistently provides radar imagery at fixed times on a near-daily basis, independently of cloud cover and sunlight. As tides have a period of 12 h 25.2 min, 1-2 year long S1 time series are therefore able to sample the whole tidal range and, thus, map the percentage of atmospheric exposure of the ITZ, which is an important environmental parameter. Tidal reference levels of mean high/low water at spring, mean and neap tide correspond each to specific percentiles of tidal heights and inversely correspond to atmospheric exposure. The presented method maps atmospheric exposure on the basis of purely statistical analyses of Sentinel-1 time series without the need for any tidal gauge data, by extracting water lines via simple thresholding of radar backscatter percentiles images. The individual thresholds for the second, fifth, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th, and 98th percentile image were determined by fitting the threshold contour lines to in situ water line GPS tracks collected at corresponding tidal reference levels at five locations around Tromso in Northern Norway. They inversely correspond to atmospheric exposures of 98%, 95%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 5%, and 2%, respectively. The method was applied to the whole Tromso Municipality resulting in an ITZ atmospheric exposure map. The validation shows that the mean low water lines at neap, mid, and spring tide were mapped with accuracies of 93%, 84%, and 64%, respectively. The overall approach should be applicable worldwide.

TI  - Hybrid Bermudagrass and Tall Fescue Turfgrass Irrigation in Central California: II. Assessment of NDVI, CWSI, and Canopy Temperature Dynamics
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As the drought conditions persist in California and water continues to become less available, the development of methods to reduce water inputs is extremely important. Therefore, improving irrigation water use efficiency and developing water conservation strategies is crucial for maintaining urban green infrastructure. This two-year field irrigation project (2018-2019) focused on the application of optical and thermal remote sensing for turfgrass irrigation management in central California. We monitored the response of hybrid bermudagrass and tall fescue to varying irrigation treatments, including irrigation levels (percentages of reference evapotranspiration, ETo) and irrigation frequency. The ground-based remote sensing data included NDVI and canopy temperature, which was subsequently used to calculate the crop water stress index (CWSI). The measurements were done within two hours of solar noon under cloud-free conditions. The NDVI and canopy temperature data were collected 21 times in 2018 and 10 times in 2019. For the tall fescue, a strong relationship was observed between NDVI and visual rating (VR) values in both 2018 (r = 0.92) and 2019 (r = 0.83). For the hybrid bermudagrass, there was no correlation in 2018 and a moderate correlation (r = 0.72) in 2019. There was a moderate correlation of 0.64 and 0.88 in 2018 and 2019 between tall fescue canopy minus air temperature difference (dt) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for the lower CWSI baseline. The correlation between hybrid bermudagrass dt and VPD for the lower baseline was 0.69 in 2018 and 0.64 in 2019. Irrigation levels significantly impacted tall fescue canopy temperature but showed no significant effect on hybrid bermudagrass canopy temperature. For the same irrigation levels, increasing irrigation frequency slightly but consistently decreased canopy temperature without compromising the turfgrass quality. The empirical CWSI values violated the minimum expected value (of 0) 38% of the time. Our results suggest NDVI thresholds of 0.6-0.65 for tall fescue and 0.5 for hybrid bermudagrass to maintain acceptable quality in the central California region. Further investigation is needed to verify the thresholds obtained in this study, particularly for hybrid bermudagrass, as the recommendation is only based on 2019 data. No CWSI threshold was determined to maintain turf quality in the acceptable range because of the high variability of CWSI values over time and their low correlation with VR values.

TI  - Worldviews Complexity in COVID-19 Times: Australian Media Representations of Religion, Spirituality and Non-Religion in 2020
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, as infections of COVID-19 began to rise, Australia, alongside many other nations, closed its international borders and implemented lockdown measures across the country. The city of Melbourne was hardest hit during the pandemic and experienced the strictest and longest lockdown worldwide. Religious and spiritual groups were especially affected, given the prohibition of gatherings of people for religious services and yoga classes with a spiritual orientation, for example. Fault lines in socio-economic differences were also pronounced, with low-wage and casual workers often from cultural and religious minorities being particularly vulnerable to the virus in their often precarious workplaces. In addition, some religious and spiritual individuals and groups did not comply and actively resisted restrictions at times. By contrast, the pandemic also resulted in a positive re-engagement with religion and spirituality, as lockdown measures served to accelerate a digital push with activities shifting to online platforms. Religious and spiritual efforts were initiated online and offline to promote wellbeing and to serve those most in need. This article presents an analysis of media representations of religious, spiritual and non-religious responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia, from January to August 2020, including two periods of lockdown. It applies a mixed-method quantitative and qualitative thematic approach, using targeted keywords identified in previous international and Australian media research. In so doing, it provides insights into Melbourne's worldview complexity, and also of the changing place of religion, spirituality and non-religion in the Australian public sphere in COVID times.

TI  - Engaging Muslim Americans for Research on Community Health: Lessons Learned from a PCOR Capacity-Building Program
T2  - PROGRESS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS-RESEARCH EDUCATION AND ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse, American Muslim communities share a religious worldview that contributes to similar health and health care behaviors. Yet, this "Muslim" dimension largely overlooked in health disparity research and intervention programs. As such, Muslim community leaders have few opportunities to participate in, and shape, research that addresses religion-related factors impacting Muslim community health outcomes.Objectives: We initiated a community-engaged, capacity-building program to develop a cohort of Muslim community leaders equipped with the knowledge and intention to participate in Muslim community-relevant, patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR).Methods: By means of a learning institute and webinars, we implemented tailored education focused on research methods, strategies for studying the religious dimensions of health behavior, PCOR tools, and skills for mosque engagement to a cohort of diverse Muslim community leaders. This cohort further participated in a consensus-building activity to identify Muslim community health priorities, and developed project proposals to tackle community health issues. Finally, we convened a national, multistakeholder conference to connect Muslim health researchers and discuss PCOR approaches to combating Muslim health disparities.Conclusions: A multi-modality capacity-building program can cultivate grassroots motivation and skills for addressing the religious dimensions of health challenges through mosque communities. Yet, for such efforts to translate into specific initiatives strategic partnerships between research funders, health care systems, and mosque community leaders is needed. Our experience suggests that holistic approaches to Muslim health concerns are desired by community members, and that, therefore, discussions and consensus-building projects should incorporate a variety of stakeholders.

TI  - An Optimal Use of SCE-UA Method Cooperated With Superpixel Segmentation for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is achieved by inferring spatial details derived from a PANchromatic (PAN) image into its corresponding expanded multispectral (MS) bands. In this letter, we propose to apply an adaptive superpixel-based injection scheme that modulates the PAN details through an optimization procedure. Optimal injection coefficients can be locally estimated by using the shuffled complex evolution developed in the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm over multiple local segments (i.e., superpixels) resulting from the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed using degraded and real data sets acquired from WorldView-3 and WorldView-4 satellites. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed adaptive injection scheme compared with other state-of-the-art pansharpening methods in terms of spatial and spectral qualities.

TI  - Identification and mapping of Algerian island vegetation using high-resolution images (Pleiades and SPOT 6/7) and random forest modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their proximity to the coast, few studies have focused on identifying and mapping the vegetation of Algerian islands and islets. To fill this lacuna, our work, using satellite images and machine learning methods, is mainly aimed at identifying and mapping the main vegetation groups on a few islands, while evaluating the effectiveness of the random forest classifier, which is effectively used in the study of the vegetation of large areas. However, despite the high heterogeneity of their vegetation cover, the use of very high-resolution images (Pleaides and SPOT 6/7), through the fusion bands and derived bands (NDVI), has allowed the elaboration of a fairly precise vegetation map that can be used for the preparation of management and protection plans for these habitats. Our methodological approach revealed very satisfactory results, having allowed the identification of the plant communities inventoried in the field, while showing high accuracy values, ranging from 0.642 for the halophilic group of Asteriscus to 1 for the endemic Chasmophyte group of the Habibas archipelago (Pleiades images). The groups identified from SPOT 6/7 images show accuracy values between 0.67 for the Mediterranean cliff formations on Garlic Islet and 1 for the two formations (shrubby and herbaceous) of the Skikda islands. Our methodological approach, and notwithstanding the great heterogeneity and the very small surface areas of our islands and islets, has led to very satisfactory results, reflected with good overall accuracy and kappa index values (for Pleiades: overall accuracy > 92% and kappa index > 0.90; for SPOT 6/7: overall accuracy > 83% and kappa index > 0.80).

TI  - Landscape Structure and Seasonality: Effects on Wildlife Species Richness and Occupancy in a Fragmented Dry Forest in Coastal Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite high fragmentation and deforestation, little is known about wildlife species richness and occurrence probabilities in tropical dry forest (TDF) landscapes. To fill this gap in knowledge, we used a Sentinel-2-derived land-cover map, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and a multi-species occupancy model to correct for detectability to assess the effect of landscape characteristics on medium and large mammal occurrence and richness in three TDF areas that differ in disturbance and seasonality in Ecuador. We recorded 15 species of medium and large mammals, distributed in 12 families; 1 species is critically Endangered, and 2 are Near-Threatened. The results indicate that species occupancy is related to low forest cover and high vegetation seasonality (i.e., high difference in NDVI between the wet and dry seasons). We believe that the apparent negative effect of forest cover is an indicator of species tolerance for disturbance. The three sampling areas varied from 98% to 40% forest cover, yet species richness and occupancy were not significantly different among them. Vegetation seasonality indicates that more seasonal forests (i.e., those where most tree species lose their leaves during the dry season) tend to have higher mammal species occupancy compared to less seasonal, semi-deciduous forests. Overall, occupancy did not vary between the dry and wet seasons, but species-specific data indicate that some species exhibit higher occupancy during the wet season. This research offers a good understanding of mammal species' responses to habitat disturbance and fragmentation in TDFs and provides insights to promote their conservation.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Local Warming Trend in Alberta, Canada during 2001-2020, and Its Relationship with Large-Scale Atmospheric Circulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, the objective was to study the local warming trend and its driving factors in the natural subregions of Alberta using a remote-sensing approach. We applied the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator on the day and nighttime MODIS LST time-series images to map and quantify the extent and magnitude of monthly and annual warming trends in the 21 natural subregions of Alberta. We also performed a correlation analysis of LST anomalies (both day and nighttime) of the subregions with the anomalies of the teleconnection patterns, i.e., Pacific North American (PNA), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), Arctic oscillation (AO), and sea surface temperature (SST, Nino 3.4 region) indices, to identify the relationship. May was the month that showed the most significant warming trends for both day and night during 2001-2020 in most of the subregions in the Rocky Mountains and Boreal Forest. Subregions of Grassland and Parkland in southern and southeastern parts of Alberta showed trends of cooling during daytime in July and August and a small magnitude of warming in June and August at night. We also found a significant cooling trend in November for both day and night. We identified from the correlation analysis that the PNA pattern had the most influence in the subregions during February to April and October to December for 2001-2020; however, none of the atmospheric oscillations showed any significant relationship with the significant warming/cooling months.

TI  - Examining rice distribution and cropping intensity in a mixed single- and double-cropping region in South China using all available Sentinel 1/ 2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice agriculture in Southern China, especially Hunan Province, has been suffered from soil contamination. Several policies including rice fallow and decreasing cropping intensity have been implemented for food safety here. It is thus important to monitor rice planting area and cropping intensity to understand the effectiveness of those land-use policies. However, it is challenging to map rice planting areas due to the complex cropping systems (mixed single- and double-cropping), persistent cloud covers, small crop fields, let alone cropping intensity. Here we used all the available Sentinel-2 and all-weather Sentinel-1 imagery to generate a time series data cube to extract paddy rice planting areas and the rice cropping intensity in the Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan areas, which is a traditional rice-growing region with small farms in China. Specifically, we investigated the performances of different features (i.e., spectral, seasonal, polarization backscatter) by comparing five scenarios with different combinations of sensors and features, and identified the most suitable features for certain rice types (early, middle, and late rice). The random forest classifier was used for the classification in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and a reference map in 2017 based on visual interpretation on the GaoFen-2 images were used for collecting the training and validation samples. The results showed the combined data from Sentinel-1/2 generally outperformed classifications using only a single sensor (Sentinel-1/2), but the contribution of different sensors to certain rice types varied. The early, middle and late rice with the highest accuracies within the five scenarios had the overall accuracies of 85%, 95%, and 95%, respectively (F1 = 0.55, 0.85, and 0.85). The compositing of different types of rice allowed us to generate the rice cropping intensity map with an overall accuracy of 81%, which to our limited knowledge is the first effort to map cropping intensity at 10-m resolution in such a fragmented subtropical region. The result showed the single cropping dominated the rice cropping system in the study area 88%, which used to be a typical area with double cropping of rice. Our study demonstrates the potential of mapping rice cropping intensity in a cloudy and highly fragmented region in South China using all the available Sentinel-1/2 data, which would advance our understanding of regional rice production and mitigation of soil contamination.

TI  - The Paraguayan Chaco at a crossroads: drivers of an emerging soybean frontier
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study analyzes potential agro-industrial soybean expansion dynamics and is the first to project soybean expansion Paraguayan Chaco. This biodiverse region, home to the greatest diversity of indigenous groups in Paraguay, has recently seen some of the world's highest deforestation rates, losing 3.4 Mha of forestland between 2001 and 2014. Soy, a globally traded commodity crop and Paraguay's largest export product, recently arrived in the area and may exacerbate the high deforestation rates currently attributed to pastureland expansion. We combine extensive field, trade, and satellite data, to analyze the context, and push-pull factors that are driving frontier expansion dynamics, and assess the potential impacts of soybean-based land use change using geo-located accounts of current soybean production sites. Our analysis finds that roughly 742,000 ha in the Paraguayan Chaco are suitable for soybean frontier expansion with an additional 940,000 ha moderately suitable for expansion. We identify the main drivers of soybean expansion in the region as agricultural technology and land price appreciation. However, infrastructure investments are set to further drive soybean expansion dynamics and connect the region via navigable rivers and roads with access to ports on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as part of the multi-national Corredor-Bioceanico "bi-oceanic corridor" road project. The continued rapid development of this fragile landscape could transform the Paraguayan Chaco into a major South American logistics hub for soybean and other agricultural production. Without appropriate governance systems in place, this development could lead to irreversible large-scale damage to the socio-environmental systems, similar to boom dynamics seen in other South American frontiers.

TI  - Accuracy of Methylene Blue Test as Single Technique for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Stages Breast Cancer.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - AIM: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) establishes as a gold standard for diagnostic lymph node involvement in early breast cancer. Most of the developed country does not have radiotracer and nuclear medicine facilities. Unless in Indonesia there is Methylene Blue as an alternative agent for SLNB. This study measure accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a single technique using the Methylene Blue test.METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 60 female patients with breast cancer stage I-II. We performed SNB using 2-5 cc of 1% Methylene-blue dye (MBD) injected to periareolar tissue and proceeded with axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND). The histopathology results of sentinel nodes (SNs) and axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) analyze for diagnostic value assessments.RESULTS: The identification rate of SN was 97.62 %, and the median number of identified SNs was 4 (2-7). Sentinel node metastasis was found in (19/60) % cases and % of them were macrometastases. The sensitivity and specificity of MBD were 91.67% and 96.67% respectively. The negative predictive value (NPV) of SNs to predict axillary metastasis was 96.67% (95% CI, 81-99%).CONCLUSION: Injection of 1% MBD as a single technique in breast cancer SNB has a favorable identification rate and predictive value.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of desertification using remote sensing
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of ecosystem change represents a key aspect to evaluate the impacts produced by desertification. Desertification is a process that affects soils with high instability and produces, in some cases, irreversible abrupt change responses. Therefore, assessing and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of desertification with remote sensing is a high research priority. It is important to assess how desertification affects the percentage of vegetation cover. But it is also very important to know how it affects the distribution of species and their functional status. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed in order to optimise the information obtained from degraded soils or drylands. One of the main limitations lies in the low signal-to-noise ratio of vegetation characterised by high soil reflectance and relatively sparse and heterogeneous vegetation. In this work, we identify some aspects that would improve the reliability of remote sensing analyses. Specifically, we recommend 1) intensifying the study of indicators by including not only changes in structure but also changes in vegetation condition or functionality and vegetation composition, 2) improving the estimation of structural and functional indicators using physical models and advanced computer models, 3) improving the multi-scale study of changes in diversity by adapting field sampling methods to the different image resolutions, 4) analysing the processes of change in structure, functionality and composition based on dynamic models that contemplate the processes of change and allow for a better understanding of the impact of desertification on ecosystem services.

TI  - Impact of biomass burnings in Southeast Asia on air quality and pollutant transport during the end of the 2019 dry season
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - At the end of the dry season, March and April in Southeast Asia (SEA), agricultural refuse burnings occur over the region, mainly in the countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, in preparation for the wet rice plantation. In this study, the impact of biomass burnings at the height of the burning period in March 2019 in mainland SEA on air quality and pollutant transport is modelled using the Weather Research Forecast WRF-Chem air quality model with emission input from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Fire Emission Inventory from NCAR (FINN). FINN is derived from satellite remote sensing data and species emission factors. A simulation of the dispersion of pollutants from biomass burnings from 13 to 19 March 2019, when the burnings was most intense, was performed. Validation of the model prediction using observed meteorological and pollutant data such as AOD measurements on ground from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) and data from MODIS and CALIPSO satellites is carried out at various sites in the region. The results show that impact on air quality was most pronounced in Thailand and Laos but the effect of biomass burnings in mainland SEA at the end of the dry season is widespread in terms of pollutant dispersion and population exposure over the whole region and beyond. It is also shown that the transport of pollutants from biomass burnings in SEA to southern China, Taiwan and beyond is facilitated by the Truong Son mountain range, when under westerly wind, acting as a launching pad to uplift the pollutant plumes to higher altitude which then can be dispersed widely and transported farther from the biomass burning sources in Thailand and Laos.

TI  - Evaluation of SWIR Crop Residue Bands for the Landsat Next Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research reports the findings of a Landsat Next expert review panel that evaluated the use of narrow shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance bands to measure ligno-cellulose absorption features centered near 2100 and 2300 nm, with the objective of measuring and mapping non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), crop residue cover, and the adoption of conservation tillage practices within agricultural landscapes. Results could also apply to detection of NPV in pasture, grazing lands, and non-agricultural settings. Currently, there are no satellite data sources that provide narrowband or hyperspectral SWIR imagery at sufficient volume to map NPV at a regional scale. The Landsat Next mission, currently under design and expected to launch in the late 2020's, provides the opportunity for achieving increased SWIR sampling and spectral resolution with the adoption of new sensor technology. This study employed hyperspectral data collected from 916 agricultural field locations with varying fractional NPV, fractional green vegetation, and surface moisture contents. These spectra were processed to generate narrow bands with centers at 2040, 2100, 2210, 2260, and 2230 nm, at various bandwidths, that were subsequently used to derive 13 NPV spectral indices from each spectrum. For crop residues with minimal green vegetation cover, two-band indices derived from 2210 and 2260 nm bands were top performers for measuring NPV (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.13) using bandwidths of 30 to 50 nm, and the addition of a third band at 2100 nm increased resistance to atmospheric correction residuals and improved mission continuity with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager Band 7. For prediction of NPV over a full range of green vegetation cover, the Cellulose Absorption Index, derived from 2040, 2100, and 2210 nm bands, was top performer (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.17), but required a narrow (<= 20 nm) bandwidth at 2040 nm to avoid interference from atmospheric carbon dioxide absorption. In comparison, broadband NPV indices utilizing Landsat 8 bands centered at 1610 and 2200 nm performed poorly in measuring fractional NPV (R-2 = 0.44), with significantly increased interference from green vegetation.

TI  - Evaluating the Applicability of Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing in Estimating Water Potential of the Karst Aquifer: A Case Study in North Adriatic, Croatia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Adriatic coast, the city of Opatija, is facing a problem concerning seasonal drinking water shortages. The existing water resources are no longer sufficient, and attention is being given to alternative resources such as the underlying karstic aquifer and several coastal springs in the city itself. However, the water potential of the area still cannot be estimated due to the insufficient hydrological data. The goal of this research was to evaluate the use of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing as the source of valuable information that will improve our understanding of the groundwater discharge dynamics. Ten Landsat ETM+ (enhanced thematic mapper plus) and two Landsat TM (thematic mapper) images of the north Adriatic, recorded during 1999-2004 at the same time as the field discharge measurements, were used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) and to analyze freshwater outflows seen as the thermal anomaly in the TIR images. The approach is based on finding the functional relationship between the size of the freshwater thermal signatures and the measured discharge data, and to estimate the water potential of the underlying aquifer. It also involved analyzing the possible connection between the adjusted size of the spring's thermal signatures and groundwater level fluctuations in the deeper karst hinterland. The proposed methodology resulted in realistic discharge estimates, as well as a good fit between thermal anomalies with measured discharges and the groundwater level. It should be emphasized that the results are site specific and based on a limited data set. However, they confirm that the proposed method can provide additional information on groundwater outflow dynamics and coastal springs' freshwater quantification.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Turbidity in the Tennessee River Using Landsat 8 Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tennessee River in the United States is one of the most ecologically distinct rivers in the world and serves as a great resource for local residents. However, it is also one of the most polluted rivers in the world, and a leading cause of this pollution is storm water runoff. Satellite remote sensing technology, which has been used successfully to study surface water quality parameters for many years, could be very useful to study and monitor the quality of water in the Tennessee River. This study developed a numerical turbidity estimation model for the Tennessee River and its tributaries in Southeast Tennessee using Landsat 8 satellite imagery coupled with near real-time in situ measurements. The obtained results suggest that a nonlinear regression-based numerical model can be developed using Band 4 (red) surface reflectance values of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor to estimate turbidity in these water bodies with the potential of high accuracy. The accuracy assessment of the estimated turbidity achieved a coefficient of determination (R-2) value and root mean square error (RMSE) as high as 0.97 and 1.41 NTU, respectively. The model was also tested on imagery acquired on a different date to assess its potential for routine remote estimation of turbidity and produced encouraging results with R-2 value of 0.94 and relatively high RMSE.

TI  - Evaluation of Vegetation Indices and Phenological Metrics Using Time-Series MODIS Data for Monitoring Vegetation Change in Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, it is essential to monitor the spatiotemporal variability and dynamics of vegetation. Among other provinces of Pakistan, Punjab has produced a significant number of crops. Recently, Punjab, Pakistan, has been described as a global hotspot for extremes of climate change. In this study, the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were comprehensively evaluated to monitor vegetation change in Punjab, Pakistan. The time-series MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data of different periods were used. The mean annual variability of the above vegetation indices (VIs) from 2000 to 2019 was evaluated and analyzed. For each type of vegetation, two phenological metrics (i.e., for the start of the season and end of the season) were calculated and compared. The spatio-temporal image analysis of the mean annual vegetation indices revealed similar patterns and varying vegetation conditions. In the forests and vegetation areas with sparse vegetation, the EVI showed high uncertainty. The phenological metrics of all vegetation indices were consistent for most types of vegetation. However, the NDVI result had the greatest variance between the start and end of season. The lowest annual VI variability was mainly observed in the southern part of the study area (less than 10% of the study area) based on the statistical analysis of spatial variability. The mean annual spatial variability of NDVI was <20%, SAVI was 30%, and EVI ranged between 10-20%. More than 40% of the variability was observed in the NDVI and SAVI vegetation indices.

TI  - Sentinel-2 MSI data for active fire detection in major fire-prone biomes: A multi-criteria approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) data exhibits the great potential of enhanced spatial and temporal coverage for monitoring biomass burning which could complement other coarse active fire detection products. This paper aims to investigate the use of reflective wavelength Sentinel-2 data to classify unambiguous active fire areas from inactive areas at 20 m spatial resolution. A multi-criteria approach based on the reflectance of several bands (i.e. B4, B11, and B12) is proposed to demonstrate the boundary constraints in several representative biomes. It is a fully automatic algorithm based on adaptive thresholds that are statistically determined from 11 million Sentinel-2 observations acquired over corresponding summertime (June 2019 to September 2019) across 14 regions or countries. Biome-based parameterizations avoid high omission errors (OE) caused by small and cool fires in different landscapes. It also takes advantage of the multiple criteria whose intersection could reduce the potential commission errors (CE) due to soil dominated pixels or highly reflective building rooftops. Active fire detection performance was mainly evaluated through visual inspection on eight illustrative subsets because of unavailable ground truth. The detection results revealed that CE and OE could be kept at a low level with 0.14 and 0.04 as an acceptable trade-off. The proposed algorithm can be employed for rapid active fire detection as soon as the image is obtained without the requirement of using multi-temporal imagery, and can even be adapted to onboard processing in the future.

TI  - Evaluation of the Radiometric Calibration of FY4A-AGRI Thermal Infrared Data Using Lake Qinghai
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The absolute radiometric accuracy of thermal infrared channels of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the FengYun-4A (FY4A) satellite was assessed with field experiment data in a vicarious calibration on 18, 2019, and August 20, 2019, in Lake Qinghai. Continuous water temperature records were collected by an unmanned surface vehicle equipped with a radiometer during the experimental period. We proposed a spectral matching method based on atmospheric transfer code to create consistent equivalent spectral radiance, and the results predicted by atmospheric transfer simulation were convolved with instrument response functions to obtain predicted brightness temperature for comparison with satellite-derived temperature. Our results indicated that AGRI had an average temperature bias of 0.12 K with an RMSE of 0.17 and 0.61 K with an RMSE of 0.22 K in band 12 and band 13 on August 18, while these biases decreased to q-0.01 K with an RMSE of 0.13 and q-0.48 K with an RMSE of 0.17 K on August 20, respectively. This radiometric accuracy indicated that AGRI TIR bands are well functional compared with their preflight requirement of less than 1 K. The uncertainty analysis also suggested that atmospheric conditions would alter the calibration accuracy by influencing the transmittance and path thermal radiance. Meanwhile, cloud cover also requires more attention to select the appropriate concurrent satellite pixels to reduce the possible cloud edge effects. It is important and necessary for FY4A AGRI to conduct more intense automatic observations and obtain more data to improve the accuracy of radiometric calibration and monitor the operational status of satellite instruments.

TI  - Assessment and Intercomparison of NOAA Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) Version 2.1
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The NOAA Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset (DOISST) has recently been updated to v2.1 (January 2016-present). Its accuracy may impact the climate assessment, monitoring and prediction, and environment-related applications. Its performance, together with those of seven other well-known sea surface temperature (SST) products, is assessed by comparison with buoy and Argo observations in the global oceans on daily 0.25 degrees X 0.25 degrees resolution from January 2016 to June 2020. These seven SST products are NASA MUR25, GHRSST GMPE, BoM GAMSSA, UKMO OSTIA, NOAA GPB, ESA CCI, and CMC. Our assessments indicate that biases and root-mean-square difference (RMSDs) in reference to all buoys and all Argo floats are low in DOISST. The bias in reference to the independent 10% of buoy SSTs remains low in DOISST, but the RMSD is slightly higher in DOISST than in OSTIA and CMC. The biases in reference to the independent 10% of Argo observations are low in CMC, DOISST, and GMPE; also, RMSDs are low in GMPE and CMC. The biases are similar in GAMSSA, OSTIA, GPB, and CCI whether they are compared against all buoys, all Argo, or the 10% of buoy or 10% of Argo observations, while the RMSDs against Argo observations are slightly smaller than those against buoy observations. These features indicate a good performance of DOISST v2.1 among the eight products, which may benefit from ingesting the Argo observations by expanding global and regional spatial coverage of in situ observations for effective bias correction of satellite data.

TI  - Changes in Nutrient Concentrations in Shenzhen Bay Detected Using Landsat Imagery between 1988 and 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shenzhen Bay (SZB), situated between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, is a typical bay system. The water quality of the bay is notably affected by domestic and industrial discharge. Rivers and various types of drainage outlets carry terrestrial pollutants into SZB, resulting in elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous as well as relatively poor water quality. For over 200 years, Hong Kong has practiced oyster farming within brackish estuarine waters. Oyster farming is a type of mariculture which includes oyster breeding in oyster rafts. Remote sensing is a monitoring technique characterized by large spatial coverage, high traceability, and low cost, making it advantageous over conventional point-based and ship-borne monitoring methods. In this study, remote-sensing models were established using machine-learning algorithms to retrieve key water-quality factors (dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and orthophosphate-phosphorous (PO4_P) concentrations, C-DIN and C-PO4_P, respectively) from long-term time-series data acquired by the Landsat satellites. (1) Spatially, the water quality in Inner SZB was worse than that in Outer SZB. (2) The water quality temporarily deteriorated between the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century; then it gradually improved in the late 2000s. (3) Monitoring the water quality in an oyster-farming area revealed that oyster farming did not adversely affect the water quality. (4) The result of monitoring the water quality in river estuaries in SZB shows that water quality was mainly affected by river input.

TI  - Research on Retrieval of Temperature Profile on Cloud Based on FY-4A/GIIRS Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud pollution can easily decrease the accuracy of satellite infrared hyperspectral observation data, leading to the loss of a large amount of observation information. In this study, a method for retrieval of temperature profile on the cloud is proposed based on observation data of FY-4A/GIIRS with cloud conditions. The radiative transfer model is used to carry out simulation experiments of observation brightness temperature under conditions of clear sky and cloud, respectively. We statistically analyze the characteristics of simulated brightness temperature changes under different channels, determine the channel selection scheme according to the cloud top pressure, and realize the retrieval of the temperature profile on the cloud through the neural network algorithm. The ERA5 reanalysis data is used as the reference standard in the accuracy evaluation of the temperature profile retrieval. The experimental results show that the overall root mean square error is better than 1. 5 K, and the retrieval temperature profile has a high accuracy, which effectively improves observation data usage rate of the FY-4A/GIIRS in the cloud under pollution.

TI  - Identifying Dynamic Changes in Water Surface Using Sentinel-1 Data Based on Genetic Algorithm and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of water surface changes provides invaluable information for water resources management and flood monitoring. However, the accurate identification of water bodies is a long-term challenge due to human activities and climate change. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been drawn, increasing attention to water extraction due to the availability of weather conditions, water sensitivity and high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study investigated the abilities of random forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and support vector machine (SVM) methods to identify water bodies using Sentinel-1 imageries in the upper stream of the Yangtze River, China. Three sets of hyper-parameters including default values, optimized by grid searches and genetic algorithms, were examined for each model. Model performances were evaluated using a Sentinel-1 image of the developed site and the transfer site. The results showed that SVM outperformed RF and XGB under the three scenarios on both the validated and transfer sites. Among them, SVM optimized by genetic algorithm obtained the best accuracy with precisions of 0.9917 and 0.985, kappa statistics of 0.9833 and 0.97, F1-scores of 0.9919 and 0.9848 on validated and transfer sites, respectively. The best model was then used to identify the dynamic changes in water surfaces during the 2020 flood season in the study area. Overall, the study further demonstrated that SVM optimized using a genetic algorithm was a suitable method for monitoring water surface changes with a Sentinel-1 dataset.

TI  - Time-Series Remote Sensing Study to Detect Surface Water Seasonality and Local Water Management at Upper Reaches of Southwestern Bengal Delta from 1972 to 2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bengal delta experiences immense seasonality of surface water due to its geographical position. This study aims to explore the extent and seasonality of surface water in the southwestern part of Bangladesh (SWB) where human intervention has been rapidly changing the land use for several decades. This explorative study relied on a total of 312 high-resolution Landsat images from 1972 to 2020 and interviews to present crucial months, seasons, and periods for surface water in SWB. The study uses a valid threshold point '0 ' for Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to extract water pixels and confirms that the NIR band has better efficacy to separate water pixels. On average, the SWB has faced around 5.5% of surface water between 1972-2001, which increased to 12.8% between 2002 and 2020. Based on the median value, around 6% of surface water was observed in the 1990s, which increased to 16% in the 2010s. The average surface water was detected around 6% and 7% in December and January between 1972 and 2001, which expanded to 18% and 19% between 2002 and 2020, mainly because of human interventions such as mix-cropping. The study strongly suggests considering December and January months for further land use and land class studies which focus on the southwestern part of Bangladesh.

TI  - Integrating intensity and context for improved supervised river ice classification from dual-pol Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - River ice is a major contributor to flood risk in cold regions due to the physical impediment of flow caused by ice jamming. Although a variety of classifiers have been developed to distinguish ice types using HH or VV intensity of SAR data, mostly based on data from RADARSAT-1 and -2, these classifiers still experience problems with breakup classification, because meltwater development causes overlap in co-polarization backscatter intensities of open water and sheet ice pixels. In this study, we develop a Random Forest classifier based on multiple features of Sentinel-1 data for three main classes generally present during breakup: rubble ice, sheet ice and open water, in a case study over the Athabasca River in Canada. For each ice stage, intensity of the VV and VH backscatter, pseudo-polarimetric decomposition parameters and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix texture features were computed for 70 verified sample areas. Several classifiers were developed, based on i) solely intensity features or on ii) a combination of intensity, pseudo-polarimetric and texture features and each classifier was evaluated based on Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation and pair-wise correlation of the studied features. Results show improved classifier performance when including GLCM mean of VV intensity, and VH intensity features instead of the conventional classifier based solely on intensity. This highlights the complementary nature of texture and intensity for the classification of breaking river ice. GLCM mean incorporates spatial patterns of the co-polarized intensity and sensitivity to context, while VH intensity introduces cross-polarized surface and volume scattering signals and is less sensitive to wind than the commonly used co-polarized intensity. We conclude that the proposed method based on the combination of texture and intensity features is suitable for and performs well in physically complex situations such as breakup, which are hard to classify otherwise. This method has a high potential for classifying river ice operationally, also for data from other SAR missions. Since it is a generic approach, it also has potential to classify river ice along other rivers globally.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer. Principle, Difficulties and Pitfalls
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel Lymph node biopsy (SLNB) represents the standard approach in a newly diagnosed breast cancer for axillary staging in cases of clinical node negative. This represents a major prognostic factor and the biopsy of sentinel lymph node for early breast cancer is used as guidance in surgical and oncological treatment. Although for many decades, axillary lymph node dissection was the standard approach for breast cancer treatment and staging, this pathway was abandoned due to significant risk of lymphedema, infection, nerve and vessels injury or dysfunction of the shoulder. Therefore, significant improvement in the quality of life was seen for patients diagnosed with early breast cancer after SLNB was introduced as standard. The principle of SLNB is based on the hypothesis that tumor drains in the lymphatic system in an orderly manner and if the first lymphatic station is clear of disease, it is highly unlike that the tumor has spread further above. We present in our paper the indications with principles and difficulties in identification of sentinel node.

TI  - Mapping Crop Types and Cropping Systems in Nigeria with Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable crop type maps from satellite data are an essential prerequisite for quantifying crop growth, health, and yields. However, such maps do not exist for most parts of Africa, where smallholder farming is the dominant system. Prevalent cloud cover, small farm sizes, and mixed cropping systems pose substantial challenges when creating crop type maps for sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we provide a mapping scheme based on freely available Sentinel-2A/B (S2) time series and very high-resolution SkySat data to map the main crops-maize and potato-and intercropping systems including these two crops on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria. We analyzed the spectral-temporal behavior of mixed crop classes to improve our understanding of inter-class spectral mixing. Building on the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE), we preprocessed S2 time series and derived spectral-temporal metrics from S2 spectral bands for the main temporal cropping windows. These STMs were used as input features in a hierarchical random forest classification. Our results provide the first wall-to-wall crop type map for this key agricultural region of Nigeria. Our cropland identification had an overall accuracy of 84%, while the crop type map achieved an average accuracy of 72% for the five relevant crop classes. Our crop type map shows distinctive regional variations in the distribution of crop types. Maize is the dominant crop, followed by mixed cropping systems, including maize-cereals and potato-maize cropping; potato was found to be the least prevalent class. Plot analyses based on a sample of 1166 fields revealed largely homogeneous mapping patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our classification system also for intercropped classes, which are temporally and spatially highly heterogeneous. Moreover, we found that small field sizes were dominant in all crop types, regardless of whether or not intercropping was used. Maize-legume and maize exhibited the largest plots, with an area of up to 3 ha and slightly more than 10 ha, respectively; potato was mainly cultivated on fields smaller than 0.5 ha and only a few plots were larger than 1 ha. Besides providing the first spatially explicit map of cropping practices in the core production area of the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, the study also offers guidance for the creation of crop type maps for smallholder-dominated systems with intercropping. Critical temporal windows for crop type differentiation will enable the creation of mapping approaches in support of future smart agricultural practices for aspects such as food security, early warning systems, policies, and extension services.

TI  - The dynamics of landscape changes surrounding a firefly ecotourism area
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) patterns have been reported to significantly affect ecotourism areas. Understanding the dynamic patterns of LULC changes is important for the efficient management of these areas. This research determined the influence of LULC changes on mangrove areas and identified the status of mangrove vegetation cover surrounding a firefly ecotourism area using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images from 2002 through 2017. A maximum likelihood classifier and normalised vegetation index differencing were used to determine LULC changes. Mangrove vegetation cover was examined using fraction vegetation cover analysis. Classification accuracy for LULC type was 86.1% and 87.2% for 2002 and 2017, respectively. The results showed a 22.06% loss (122.52 ha) and 4.47% increase (24.99 ha) in mangrove areas. Mangrove areas were converted to oil palm plantations (32.7%), forests (32.3%), settlements (9.25%), barren land (8.99%), rivers (6.8%), swampland (6.11%), urban development (1.67%), rubber plantations (1.25%), bodies of water (0.77%) and roads (0.09%). Increases in mangrove vegetation cover were observed along riverbanks away from development activities. Decreases in mangrove vegetation cover were affected by land-use activities. Proper management is required to avoid further loss of mangrove areas, and appropriate LULC management planning is needed to conserve mangrove areas and sustain firefly ecotourism.

TI  - Reinitializing Sea Surface Temperature in the Ensemble Intermediate Coupled Model for Improved Forecasts
T2  - AXIOMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ensemble Intermediate Coupled Model (EICM) is a model used for studying the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, which is anomalies in the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are observed. This research aims to implement Cressman to improve SST forecasts. The simulation considers two cases in this work: the control case and the Cressman initialized case. These cases are simulations using different inputs where the two inputs differ in terms of their resolution and data source. The Cressman method is used to initialize the model with an analysis product based on satellite data and in situ data such as ships, buoys, and Argo floats, with a resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees. The results of this inclusion are the Cressman Initialized Ensemble Intermediate Coupled Model (CIEICM). Forecasting of the sea surface temperature anomalies was conducted using both the EICM and the CIEICM. The results show that the calculation of SST field from the CIEICM was more accurate than that from the EICM. The forecast using the CIEICM initialization with the higher-resolution satellite-based analysis at a 6-month lead time improved the root mean square deviation to 0.794 from 0.808 and the correlation coefficient to 0.630 from 0.611, compared the control model that was directly initialized with the low-resolution in-situ-based analysis.

TI  - Methodology for determining runoff coefficients using open-access images and classification open-source algorithms
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a methodology using Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 images to determine Landcover and Runoff Coefficient. It considers geographic and climatic characteristics of the region, resolutions of sensors, and accuracy obtained using four classifiers: Minimum Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Maximum Likelihood, and Support Vector Machines. The methodology was applied to regions in Mexico with diverse characteristics. The overall accuracy, commission, and omission were obtained for each classifier-sensor combination. These indicators were analyzed by region, sensor, and algorithm. Presence, accuracy, error of commission, and omission of cover were analyzed according to land cover class. Landsat-8 had the highest average accuracy (76.1 %), followed by Sentinel-2 (75 %), and Sentinel-1 (38.8 %). Minimum distance had the highest accuracy (71.2 %), followed by Support Vector Machines with 70.5 %, Spectral Angel Mapper with 60.9 %, and Maximum Likelihood with 50.7 %. This methodology makes it possible to use open-access satellite images and programs to define criteria for determining land cover with good accuracy and high spatial resolution. The results of our research show that to estimate runoff coefficients, open-access satellite images must be selected based on criteria such as sensor resolutions, classification algorithm to be used, period and scale of the study, climate, types, and dynamics of land coverage, as well as the dominant coverage class.

TI  - LAND USE LAND COVER MAPPING USING ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the recent climate changes such as floods and droughts, there is a need for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping to monitor environmental changes that have effects on ecology, policy management, health and disaster management. As such, in this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), are used for land cover mapping. In addition, two advanced deep learning algorithms, namely, the GAMLP and FSMLP, that are based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function are developed in MATLAB programming language. The GAMLP uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise parameters of the MLP function and, on the other hand, the FSMLP uses a derivative-free function for optimisation of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted LULC map. Results based on the statistical indices, including overall accuracy (OA) and kappa index, show that the developed MLP-based algorithms have relatively high accuracies with higher than 98% correct classification. Besides the statistical indices, final LULC maps are interpreted visually where the GAMLP and FSMLP give the best results for the pre-processed Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m, but they have the worst outcomes for the unprocessed Landsat-8 imagery compared to SVM and RF classifiers visually and statistically.

TI  - A Cloud-Based Framework for Large-Scale Monitoring of Ocean Plastics Using Multi-Spectral Satellite Imagery and Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine debris is considered a threat to the inhabitants, as well as the marine environments. Accumulation of marine debris, besides climate change factors, including warming water, sea-level rise, and changes in oceans' chemistry, are causing the potential collapse of the marine environment's health. Due to the increase of marine debris, including plastics in coastlines, ocean and sea surfaces, and even in deep ocean layers, there is a need for developing new advanced technology for the detection of large-sized marine pollution (with sizes larger than 1 m) using state-of-the-art remote sensing and machine learning tools. Therefore, we developed a cloud-based framework for large-scale marine pollution detection with the integration of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and advanced machine learning tools on the Sentinel Hub cloud application programming interface (API). Moreover, we evaluated the performance of two shallow machine learning algorithms of random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), as well as the deep learning method of the generative adversarial network-random forest (GAN-RF) for the detection of ocean plastics in the pilot site of Mytilene Island, Greece. Based on the obtained results, the shallow algorithms of RF and SVM achieved an overall accuracy of 88% and 84%, respectively, with available training data of plastic debris. The GAN-RF classifier improved the detection of ocean plastics of the RF method by 8%, achieving an overall accuracy of 96% by generating several synthetic ocean plastic samples.

TI  - The Use of Satellite Data to Determine the Changes of Hydrodynamic Parameters in the Gulf of Gdansk via EcoFish Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using mathematical models alone to describe the changes in the parameters characterizing the analyzed reservoir may be insufficient due to the complexity of ocean circulation. One of the ways to improve the accuracy of models is to use data assimilation based on remote sensing methods. In this study, we tested the EcoFish numerical model that was developed for the Gulf of Gdansk area, under the FindFish Knowledge Transfer Platform. In order to improve the model results and map local phenomena occurring in the studied water, which would be difficult to simulate using only mathematical equations, EcoFish was extended with a satellite data assimilation module that assimilates the sea surface temperature data from a medium-resolution imaging spectroradiometer and an advanced ultrahigh-resolution radiometer. EcoFish was then statistically validated, which resulted in high correlations for water temperature and salinity as well as low errors in comparison with in situ experimental data.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Potential Evapotranspiration in Real-Time from GK2A/AMI Data Using Artificial Neural Network for the Korean Peninsula
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental factor in energy and hydrologic cycles. Although highly precise in-situ ET monitoring is possible, such data are not always available due to the high spatiotemporal variability in ET. This study estimates daily potential ET (PET) in real-time for the Korean Peninsula, via an artificial neural network (ANN), using data from the GEO-KOMPSAT 2A satellite, which is equipped with an Advanced Meteorological Imager (GK2A/AMI). We also used passive microwave data, numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data, and static data. The ANN-based PET model was trained using data for the period 25 July 2019 to 24 July 2020, and was tested by comparing with in-situ PET for the period 25 July 2020 to 31 July 2021. In terms of accuracy, the PET model performed well, with root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.649 mm day(-1), -0.134 mm day(-1), and 0.954, respectively. To examine the efficiency of the GK2A/AMI-derived PET data, we compared it with in-situ ET measured at flux towers and with MODIS PET data. The accuracy of the GK2A/AMI-derived PET, in comparison with the flux tower-measured ET, showed RMSE, bias, and Pearson's R of 1.730 mm day(-1), 1.212 mm day(-1), and 0.809, respectively. In comparison with the in-situ PET, the ANN model produced more accurate estimates than the MODIS data, indicating that it is more locally optimized for the Korean Peninsula than MODIS. This study advances the field by applying an ANN approach using GK2A/AMI data and could play an important role in examining hydrologic energy for air-land interactions.

TI  - Magnetic-Guided Axillary UltraSound (MagUS) Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Mapping in Patients with Early Breast Cancer. A Phase 2, Single-Arm Prospective Clinical Trial
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) have been shown to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with breast cancer. This study investigated whether a minimally invasive approach with MRI-LG after SPIO injection in the breast followed by a magnetic guided axillary ultrasound and core biopsy of the SLN (MagUS) could accurately stage the axilla. The study included not only patients planned for primary surgery but also patients with recurrent cancer after previous surgery, but also patients scheduled for neoadjuvant treatment (NAT). The latter underwent minimally invasive SLNB prior to treatment and had their SLN clipped; surgery in the axilla was performed after NAT. In 79 included patients, MagUS detected all patients with macrometastasis and performed comparably with surgical sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND). It also allowed for marking of the SLN in patients planned for PST and enabled tailored decision making in breast cancer recurrence. Lymph Node Dissection (SLND) is standard of care for diagnosing sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in patients with early breast cancer. Study aim was to determine whether the combination of Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) MRI-lymphography (MRI-LG) and a Magnetic-guided Axillary UltraSound (MagUS) with biopsy can allow for minimally invasive, axillary evaluation to de-escalate surgery. Patients were injected with 2 mL of SPIO and underwent MRI-LG for SN mapping. Thereafter MagUS and core needle biopsy (CNB) were performed. Patients planned for neoadjuvant treatment, the SLN was clipped and SLND was performed after neoadjuvant with the addition of isotope. During surgery, SLNs were controlled for signs of previous biopsy or clip. The primary endpoint was MagUS SLN detection rate, defined as successful SLN detection of at least one SLN of those retrieved in SLND. In 79 patients, 48 underwent upfront surgery, 12 received neoadjuvant and 19 had recurrent cancer. MagUS traced the SLN in all upfront and neoadjuvant cases, detecting all patients with macrometastases (n = 10). MagUS missed only one micrometastasis, outperforming baseline axillary ultrasound AUS (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.508, p < 0.001) and showing no discordance to SLND (p = 1.000). MagUS provides the niche for minimally invasive axillary mapping that can reduce diagnostic surgery.

TI  - Application of an indocyanine green surgical fluorescence imaging system in sentinel lymph node biopsy of acral malignant melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Regional lymph node status is an independent influencing factor for the prognosis of acral malignant melanoma, and the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is directly related to the judgment of regional lymph node status. This study aimed to explore the application value of indocyanine green (ICG) surgical fluorescence imaging system in the SLNB of acral malignant melanoma. Methods: A total of 34 patients with acral malignant melanoma were admitted to the Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery in Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020. Among these patients, 22 required SLNB. ICG and methylene blue (MB) were combined to intraoperatively trace the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The total number of SLNs detected during the operation was counted. We compared the number, detection rate, as well as the detection rate and false negative rate of positive SLNs of SLNs detected by ICG, MB, and ICG combined with MB. Results: A total of 56 SLNs were detected in the 22 patients, among which 55 were detected by ICG (98%), 41 were detected by MB (71%), and 56 (100%) were detected by ICG combined with MB, and the average number of SLNs were 2.5, 1.64, and 2.55, respectively. A total of nine SLNs were detected, of which nine were detected by ICG (100%), seven by MB (78%), and nine by ICG combined with MB (100%). Patients with negative SLNs had no recurrence at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: Compared with MB, the ICG fluorescent imaging system can improve the detection rate of SLNs in patients with acral malignant melanoma. Also, ICG combined with MB was superior to ICG alone.

TI  - Vectorcardiography as a prognostic tool in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vectorcardiography (VCG) has demonstrated diagnostic value in the assessment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), however, determining its prognostic value over time has not yet been investigated. This study sought to assess the correlation of VCG parameters with the progression of HCM. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 119 pediatric patients with diagnosis of HCM at the University of Min-nesota. Eighty-three cases were excluded because of age, presence of congenital heart disease, not meeting criteria for HCM or negative phenotype. Sample was divided into 2 groups based on the presence or not of cardiac events (ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, ventricular assist device, heart transplant). Derived vectorcardiography from standard 12-lead ECG was obtained for the first ECG and last available or prior to sen-tinel event. Results: Of the 36 cases that met inclusion criteria, 9 (25%) developed a sentinel event. The median age for the event group was 10.1 +/- 7.5 years and for the non-event group was 8.7 +/- 6.35 years. There was no significant difference in age or sex between the groups. The T wave vector magnitude value was significantly smaller in the event group than in the non-event group (0.302 +/- 0.146 mV Vs. 0.561 +/- 0.305 mV, p 0.002), with a hazard ratio of 0.651 (95% CI 0.463 to 0.915). No other parameter showed significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: The T wave vector magnitude may predict sentinel events in HCM. Prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the utility of the evolution of VCG parameters. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting spatiotemporally-resolved mean air temperature over Sweden from satellite data using an ensemble model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of air temperature (Ta) at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical to reducing exposure assessment errors in epidemiological studies on the health effects of air temperature. In this study, we applied a three-stage ensemble model to estimate daily mean Ta from satellite-based land surface temperature (Ts) over Sweden during 2001-2019 at a high spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km2. The ensemble model incorporated four base models, including a generalized additive model (GAM), a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), and two machine learning models (random forest [RF] and extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]), and allowed the weights for each model to vary over space, with the best-performing model for each grid cell assigned the highest weight. Various spatial predictors were included as adjustment variables in all the base models, including land cover type, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and elevation. The ensemble model showed high performance with an overall R2 of 0.98 and a root mean square error of 1.38 degrees C in the ten-fold cross-validation, and outperformed each of the four base models. Although each base model performed well, the two machine learning models (RF [R2 = 0.97], XGBoost [R2 = 0.98]) had better performance than the two regression models (GAM [R2 = 0.95], GAMM [R2 = 0.96]). In the machine learning models, Ts was the dominant predictor of Ta, followed by day of year, NDVI, latitude, elevation, and longitude. The highly spatiotemporally-resolved Ta can improve temperature exposure assessment in future epidemiological studies.

TI  - Schistosome infection in Senegal is associated with different spatial extents of risk and ecological drivers for <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> and <i>S. mansoni</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Schistosome parasites infect more than 200 million people annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, where people may be co-infected with more than one species of the parasite. Infection risk for any single species is determined, in part, by the distribution of its obligate intermediate host snail. As the World Health Organization reprioritizes snail control to reduce the global burden of schistosomiasis, there is renewed importance in knowing when and where to target those efforts, which could vary by schistosome species. This study estimates factors associated with schistosomiasis risk in 16 villages located in the Senegal River Basin, a region hyperendemic for Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. We first analyzed the spatial distributions of the two schistosomes' intermediate host snails (Bulinus spp. and Biomphalaria pfeifferi, respectively) at village water access sites. Then, we separately evaluated the relationships between human S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections and (i) the area of remotely-sensed snail habitat across spatial extents ranging from 1 to 120 m from shorelines, and (ii) water access site size and shape characteristics. We compared the influence of snail habitat across spatial extents because, while snail sampling is traditionally done near shorelines, we hypothesized that snails further from shore also contribute to infection risk. We found that, controlling for demographic variables, human risk for S. haematobium infection was positively correlated with snail habitat when snail habitat was measured over a much greater radius from shore (45 m to 120 m) than usual. S. haematobium risk was also associated with large, open water access sites. However, S. mansoni infection risk was associated with small, sheltered water access sites, and was not positively correlated with snail habitat at any spatial sampling radius. Our findings highlight the need to consider different ecological and environmental factors driving the transmission of each schistosome species in co-endemic landscapes.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of chlorophyll from satellite derived data and CMIP5 models along Indian coastal regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparison of chlorophyll data of three sets of CMIP5 models for RCP 4.5 (MPI-ESM-MR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M) and RCP 6.0 (IPSL-CM5A-LR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M) were done with satellite derived data (OC-CCI) for the period of 1998-2017 along four Indian coastal regions. The monthly, yearly and zone-wise seasonal comparison between model and satellite data were carried out. Analysis of monthly variations of chlorophyll during 1998-2017 reveals that the satellite data show maximum value of 0.53 mg/m(3) in September, whereas all other models show maximum in August. Yearly analysis indicates maximum satellite data in the year 2004, while minimum was observed in 2015. HadGEM2-ES exhibited maximum model value and the lowest was found for IPSL-CM5A-LR. It was observed that the maximum chlorophyll value of 2.56 mg/m(3) for satellite data was in the monsoon season and the lowest value of 0.14 mg/m(3) was in the pre-monsoon. Seasonal analysis reveals no clear match among model and satellite values in any of the coastal regions. In northwest and northeast regions, the satellite values were found higher than the model values in most of the years, whereas in other regions, the model values were found fluctuating with the satellite values. Owing to the mismatch of the model and the satellite values, the work cautions to apply biases or corrections on usage of RCP model data for regional marine climate change research.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Short-Term Economic Forecasts
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic forecasts are an important instrument to judge the nation-wide economic situation. Such forecasts are mainly based on data from statistical offices. However, there is a time lag between the end of the reporting period and the release of the statistical data that arises for instance from the time needed to collect and process the data. To improve the forecasts by reducing the delay, it is of interest to find alternative data sources that provide information on economic activity without significant delays. Among others, satellite images are thought to assist here. This paper addresses the potential of earth observation imagery for short-term economic forecasts. The study is focused on the estimation of investments in the construction sector based on high resolution (HR) (10-20 m) and very high resolution (VHR) (0.3-0.5 m) images as well as on the estimation of investments in agricultural machinery based on orthophotos (0.1 m) simulating VHR satellite imagery. By applying machine learning it is possible to extract the objects of interest to a certain extent. For the detection of construction areas, VHR satellite images are much better suited than HR satellite images. VHR satellite images with a ground resolution of 30-50 cm are able to identify agricultural machinery. These results are promising and provide new and unconventional input for economic forecasting models.

TI  - Development of UAV-Based PM<sub>2.5</sub> Monitoring System
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a UAV-based PM2.5 air quality and temperature-humidity monitoring system. The system includes an air quality detector comprising four Arduino sensor modules. Specifically, it includes a dust (DSM501A) sensor and a temperature and humidity (DHT11) sensor. The NEO-6M GPS module and DS3231 real-time module are also included for input visualization. A DIY SD card logging shield and memory module is also available for data recording purposes. The Arduino-based board houses multiple sensors and all are programmable using the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) coding tool. Measurements conducted in a vertical flight path show promise where comparisons with ground truth references data showed good similarity. Overall, the results point to the idea that a light-weight and portable system can be used for accurate and reliable remote sensing data collection (in this case, PM2.5 concentration data and environmental data).

T2  - MEMO-MAGAZINE OF EUROPEAN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium is one of the largest meetings addressing the treatment of breast cancer patients; therefore, the meeting is of high interest for breast cancer specialists from around the world. From the meeting in 2020, which was held virtually, I have picked the top three surgical abstracts to show new developments in the surgical treatment of breast cancer patients. The first abstract addresses the question of whether an axillary dissection is necessary or not, in a selected patient cohort. The results, even after a short follow-up time, could confirm the findings of the ACOZOG Z 0011 trial. The second abstract refers to the question of whether sentinel node biopsy is always mandatory in older patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Finally, the third abstract focuses on a trial dedicated to the sentinel lymph node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These three abstracts show the importance of the surgical management of the axilla, under special circumstances.

TI  - The Impact of Different Types of Hydrocarbon Disturbance on the Resiliency of Native Desert Vegetation in a War-Affected Area: A Case Study from the State of Kuwait
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the impact of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration and soil parameters (heavy metals, chemical properties, and water-soluble boron) on the succession process of vegetation survival in the Al-Burgan oil field in Kuwait. A total of 145 soil samples were randomly collected from the three main types of hydrocarbon contamination, including dry oil lake (DOL), wet oil lake (WOL), and tarcrete. Sampling was also extended to noncontaminated bare soils that were considered reference sites. Remote-sensing data from Sentinel-2 were also processed to assess the level of contamination in relation to soil surface cover. The results showed that TPH concentration was significantly higher in WOL and DOL (87,961.4 and 35,740.6 mg/kg, respectively) compared with that in tarcrete (24,063.3 mg/kg), leading to a significant increase in soil minerals and heavy metals, greater than 50 mg/kg for Ba, and 10 mg/kg for V, Zn, Ni, and Cr. Such high concentrations of heavy metals massively affected the native vegetation's resiliency at these sites (<5% vegetation cover). However, vegetation cover was significantly higher (60%) at tarcrete-contaminated sites, as TPH concentration was lower, almost similar to that in uncontaminated areas, especially at subsurface soil layers. The presence of vegetation at tarcrete locations was also associated with the lower concentration of Ba, V, Zn, Ni, and Cr. The growth of native vegetation was more likely related to the low concentration of TPH contamination at the subsurface layer of the soils in tarcrete sites, making them more suitable sites for restoration and revegetation planning. We concluded that further investigations are required to provide greater insight into the native plants' phytoextraction potential and phytoremediation.

TI  - Land Degradation and Development Processes and Their Response to Climate Change and Human Activity in China from 1982 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and development (LDD) has become an urgent global issue. Quick and accurate monitoring of LDD dynamics is key to the sustainability of land resources. By integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and net primary productivity (NPP) based on the Euclidean distance method, a LDD index (LDDI) was introduced to detect LDD processes, and to explore its quantitative relationship with climate change and human activity in China from 1985 to 2015. Overall, China has experienced significant land development, about 45% of China's mainland, during the study period. Climate change (temperature and precipitation) played limited roles in the affected LDD, while human activity was the dominant driving force. Specifically, LDD caused by human activity accounted for about 58% of the total, while LDD caused by climate change only accounted for 0.34% of the total area. Results from the present study can provide insight into LDD processes and their driving factors and promote land sustainability in China and around the world.

TI  - Monitoring Vegetation Change and Its Potential Drivers in Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia in China is a typically arid and semi-arid region with vegetation prominently affected by global warming and human activities. Therefore, investigating the past and future vegetation change and its impact mechanism is important for assessing the stability of the ecosystem and the ecological policy formulation. Vegetation changes, sustainability characteristics, and the mechanism of natural and anthropogenic effects in Inner Mongolia during 2000-2019 were examined using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Theil-Sen trend analysis, Mann-Kendall method, and the coefficient of variation method were used to analyze the spatiotemporal variability characteristics and sustained stability of the NDVI. Furthermore, a trend estimation method based on a Seasonal Trend Model (STM), and the Hurst index was used to analyze breakpoints and change trends, and predict the likely future direction of vegetation, respectively. Additionally, the mechanisms of the compound influence of natural and anthropogenic activities on the vegetation dynamics in Inner Mongolia were explored using a Geodetector Model. The results show that the NDVI of Inner Mongolia shows an upward trend with a rate of 0.0028/year (p < 0.05) from 2000 to 2019. Spatially, the NDVI values showed a decreasing trend from the northeast to the southwest, and the interannual variation fluctuated widely, with coefficients of variation greater than 0.15, for which the high-value areas were in the territory of the Alxa League. The areas with increased, decreased, and stable vegetation patterns were approximately equal in size, in which the improved areas were mainly distributed in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia, the stable and unchanged areas were mostly in the desert, and the degraded areas were mainly in the central-eastern part of Inner Mongolia, it shows a trend of progressive degradation from east to west. Breakpoints in the vegetation dynamics occurred mainly in the northwestern part of Inner Mongolia and the northeastern part of Hulunbuir, most of which occurred during 2011-2014. The future NDVI trend in Inner Mongolia shows an increasing trend in most areas, with only approximately 10% of the areas showing a decreasing trend. Considering the drivers of the NDVI, we observed annual precipitation, soil type, mean annual temperature, and land use type to be the main driving factors in Inner Mongolia. Annual precipitation was the first dominant factor, and when these four dominant factors interacted to influence vegetation change, they all showed interactive enhancement relationships. The results of this study will assist in understanding the influence of natural elements and human activities on vegetation changes and their driving mechanisms, while providing a scientific basis for the rational and effective protection of the ecological environment in Inner Mongolia.

TI  - Optimizing Axillary Management in Clinical T1-2N0 Mastectomy Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Following publication of the AMAROS trial, we sought to optimize axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) + axillary radiation (AxRT) utilization in cT1-2N0 patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) after mastectomy. Methods In November 2015, our multidisciplinary group implemented a protocol to omit intraoperative SLN evaluation for mastectomy patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer likely to be recommended PMRT if found to have 1-2 positive SLNs (age <= 60 years and/or high-risk features defined as estrogen receptor-negative and/or positive for lymphovascular invasion). We prospectively evaluated axillary management, short-term complications, and oncologic outcomes in patients with 1-2 positive SLNs. Results From November 2015 to December 2018, 479 of 560 (85%) cT1-2N0 breast cancers treated with mastectomy were potential candidates for PMRT. Intraoperative SLN evaluation was omitted in 344 (72%), thus following the protocol. Overall, 121 cases had 1-2 positive SLNs: 17 (14%) were managed with observation, 5 (4%) PMRT alone, 59 (49%) PMRT + AxRT, 16 (13%) ALND alone, and 24 (20%) ALND + PMRT. Protocol compliance resulted in less ALND (8% vs. 24%) and less ALND + PMRT (9% vs. 41%, p < 0.01). At median follow-up of 24 months, there was one regional and four distant recurrences, with no regional recurrences or differences in disease-free survival in patients treated with ALND versus PMRT + AxRT (100% vs. 98%, p = 0.67). Similarly, there were no differences in complication rates (p = 0.18). Conclusions Omitting intraoperative SLN evaluation in cT1-2N0 mastectomy patients who would be candidates for PMRT if found to have positive nodes decreased rates of ALND and minimized use of ALND + PMRT without compromising outcomes.

TI  - Neotectonics of the Western Suleiman Fold Belt, Pakistan: Evidence for Bookshelf Faulting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Suleiman Fold-Thrust Belt represents an active deformational front at the western margin of the Indian plate and has been a locus of major earthquakes. This study focuses on the western part of the Suleiman Fold-Thrust Belt that comprises two parallel NW-SE oriented faults: Harnai Fault and Karahi Fault. These faults have known thrust components; however, there remains uncertainty about the lateral component of motion. This work presents the new observation of surface deformation using the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique on Sentinel-1A datasets to decompose displacement into the vertical and horizontal components employing ascending and descending track geometries. The subsurface structural geometry of this area was assessed using 2D seismic and well data. In addition, geomorphic indices were calculated to assess the relative tectonic activity of the area. InSAR results show that the Karahi Fault has a similar to 15 mm right-lateral movement for descending and similar to 10 mm/for ascending path geometries. The Harnai Fault does not show any lateral movement. Seismic data are in agreement with the InSAR results suggesting that the Harnai Fault is a blind thrust. This work indicates that the block between these two faults displays a clockwise rotation that creates the "bookshelf model".

TI  - Using UAV and satellite image data for analyzing the elevation change of debris-covered glaciers and its associated driving factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we aim to determine the interactions of debris-covered glacier elevation change with some glacial properties (including ice thickness, surface temperature, debris albedo, and supraglacial lakes) over the largest and the most dynamic glacier in Iran, Alamkouh Glacier, using the repeated acquisition of high-resolution remote sensing data and in-situ measurements during 2010-2018. First, we present the elevation change of Alamkouh glacier using digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and LiDAR. Results revealed that on the whole glacier area, the LiDAR and UAV datasets achieved a highly consistent estimate of glacier elevation change at - 1.6 +/- 0.2 m during 2010 and 2018. On the local scale, datasets revealed a clear constant between moderate elevation change of the two smaller flow units of the glacier (about - 0.48 +/- 0.06 and - 0.37 +/- 0.04 m) and significantly more negative elevation change in the main flow unit (- 2.5 +/- 0.31 m). Results show that the elevation change of the Alamkouh glacier is jointly influenced by supraglacial lakes and the types of glacier cover. The regions where the rates of thinning are greatest coincide with the regions where the supraglacial lakes exist. In contrast, a weak relationship existed between the elevation change and glacier surface albedo and especially ice thickness. We observed a remarkable negative elevation change (- 6.3 m) of areas connected with supraglacial lakes in comparison with clean ice (- 3.1 m) and debris-covered (- 1.71 m) areas. It is proven that the quantity and area of the supraglacial lakes are the key to understanding the melting rate of the debris-covered glacier. Our observations infer the significant insulating function of debris cover on the Alamkouh glacier and highlight the effect of supraglacial lakes on enhancing glacier wastage.

TI  - Automated Framework to Audit Traffic Signs Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traffic signs play a critical role in the safety and efficiency of any roadway; however, limited information exists on current traffic sign inventories (TSIs). The size of current traffic sign networks makes it economically challenging to apply traditional survey methods to the collection of a TSI. This paper proposes the use of light detection and ranging and video-log imaging to conduct a TSI, tested along a 4-km segment in Alberta, Canada. Signs along the segment were extracted through a Gaussian mixture model before measuring sign panel orientation. Then, the road surface near each traffic sign was extracted to measure its lateral and vertical placement. Next, sign classification was determined by applying a trained convolutional neural network. Finally, traffic sign visibility was measured to assess the time available for drivers to read and react to traffic signs. The extraction of traffic signs and the left and right lane markings had F1 scores of 95.1%, 94.4%, and 89.6%, respectively. The extractions were completed with a high degree of accuracy and with time benefits over traditional manual methods. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

T2  - FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, the geographic, observational, functional, and cartographic scale is unified into a single mathematical formulation for the purposes of earth observation image classification. Fractal analysis is used to define functional scales, which then are linked to the other concepts of scale using common equations and conditions. The proposed formulation is called Unified Scale Theorem (UST), and was assessed with Sentinel-2 image covering a variety of land uses from the broad area of Thessaloniki, Greece. Provided as an interactive excel spreadsheet, UST promotes objectivity, rapidity, and accuracy, thus facilitating optimal scale selection for image classification purposes.

TI  - Modeling the Near-Surface Energies and Water Vapor Fluxes Behavior in Response to Summer Canopy Density across Yanqi Endorheic Basin, Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yanqi basin is the main irrigated and active agroecosystem in semi-arid Xinjiang, northwestern China, which further seeks responses to the profound local water-related drawbacks in relation to the unceasing landscape desiccation and scant precipitation. Yet, it comes as an astonishment that a few reported near-surface items and water vapor fluxes as so far required for water resources decision support, particularly in a scarce observation data region. As a contributive effort, here we adjusted the sensible heat flux (H) calibration mechanism of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to high-resolution satellite dataset coupled with in-situ observation, through a wise guided "anchor" pixel assortment from surface reflectance-alpha, Leaf area index-LAI, vegetation index-NDVI, and surface temperature (P-cold, P-hot) to model the robustness of energy fluxes and Evapotranspiration-ETa over the basin. Results reasonably reflected ETa which returned low RMSE (0.6 mm d(-1)), MAE (0.48 mm d(-1)) compared to in-situ recordings, indicating the competence of SEBAL to predict vapor fluxes in this region. The adjustment unveiled the estimates of the land-use contribution to evapotranspiration with an average ranging from 3 to 4.69 mm d(-1), reaching a maximum of 5.5 mm d(-1). Furthermore, findings showed a high striking energy dissipation (LE/Rn) across grasslands and wetlands. The vegetated surfaces with a great evaporative fraction were associated with the highest LE/Rn (70-90%), and water bodies varying between 20% and 60%, while the desert ecosystem dissipated the least energy with a low evaporative fraction. Still, besides high portrayed evaporation in water, grasslands and wetlands varied interchangeably in accounting for the highest ETa followed by cropland. Finally, a substantial nexus between available energy (Rn-G) and ETa informed the available energy, influenced by NDVI to be the primary driver of these oases' transpiration. This study provides essentials of near-surface energy fluxes and the likelihood of ETa with considerable baseline inferences for Yanqi that may be beneficial for long-term investigations that will attend in agrometeorological services and sustainable management of water resources in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Hydrological Responses to Land Use Land Cover Changes in the Fincha'a Watershed, Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) changes are highly pronounced in African countries, as they are characterized by an agriculture-based economy and a rapidly growing population. Understanding how land use/cover changes (LULCC) influence watershed hydrology will enable local governments and policymakers to formulate and implement effective and appropriate response strategies to minimize the undesirable effects of future land use/cover change or modification and sustain the local socio-economic situation. The hydrological response of the Ethiopia Fincha'a watershed to LULCC that happened during 25 years was investigated, comparing the situation in three reference years: 1994, 2004, and 2018. The information was derived from Landsat sensors, respectively Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The various LULC classes were derived via ArcGIS using a supervised classification system, and the accuracy assessment was done using confusion matrixes. For all the years investigated, the overall accuracies and the kappa coefficients were higher than 80%, with 2018 as the more accurate year. The analysis of LULCC revealed that forest decreased by 20.0% between the years 1994-2004, and it decreased by 11.8% in the following period 2004-2018. Such decline in areas covered by forest is correlated to an expansion of cultivated land by 16.4% and 10.81%, respectively. After having evaluated the LULCC at the basin scale, the watershed was divided into 18 sub-watersheds, which contained 176 hydrologic response units (HRUs), having a specific LULC. Accounting for such a detailed subdivision of the Fincha'a watershed, the SWAT model was firstly calibrated and validated on past data, and then applied to infer information on the hydrological response of each HRU on LULCC. The modelling results pointed out a general increase of average water flow, both during dry and wet periods, as a consequence of a shift of land coverage from forest and grass towards settlements and build-up areas. The present analysis pointed out the need of accounting for past and future LULCC in modelling the hydrological responses of rivers at the watershed scale.

In recent years, wetlands in Algeria have experienced a significant deterioration in the natural quality of the landscapes that compose them. This is the case of the El Kala National Park in the far northeast of Algeria. The state of degradation of the open plant of this park is urgently to look at the state of the art in the face of multiple threats that affect these spaces. The exploitation of the Landsat satellite images, coupled with GIS and supplemented by field surveys and climate and documentary data, made it possible to analyze the vegetation cover and its evolution between 1987 and 2016. The results of our study show that the vegetation cover during the period (1987-2016) lost 7.49% (6038 ha) of its natural vegetation. Also this work allowed us to set up a cartographic base which can constitute a precious tool of management of this protected area. This method is simple and adaptable to other protected areas of Algeria.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry in shallow waters off coastal areas has been measured using conventional methods such as with single-beam and multi-beam echo-sounders installed on the ship. However, shipborne depth data are spatially limited and unevenly distributed over shallow waters off coastal areas. In this study, various methods that use satellite altimetry-derived gravity anomalies and high-resolution remote sensed imagery were explored for the recovery of high-resolution bathymetry data over shallow waters off Gwangyang Bay between Yeosu Peninsula and Namhae Island on the South Sea of Korea. Estimated high-resolution bathymetry data from satellite altimetry-derived gravity anomalies and remote sensed imagery were compared with shipborne depth measurements to validate their accuracy in shallow waters. This study concluded that bathymetry data estimated with the gravity-geologic method (GGM) in shallow waters are better than those predicted by Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Time-Series Assessment of Camp-Type Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Sectors with Large Influxes of Miners Using LANDSAT Imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining sites development have had a significant impact on local socioeconomic conditions, the environment, and sustainability. However, the transformation of camp-type artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sites with large influxes of miners from different regions has not been properly evaluated, owing to the closed nature of the ASGM sector. Here, we use remote sensing imagery and field investigations to assess ASGM sites with large influxes of miners living in mining camps in Bone Bolango Regency, Gorontalo Province, Indonesia, in 1995-2020. Built-up areas were identified as indicators of transformation of camp-type ASGM sites, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, from the time series of images obtained using Google Earth Engine, then correlated with the prevalent gold market price. An 18.6-fold increase in built-up areas in mining camps was observed in 2020 compared with 1995, which correlated with increases in local gold prices. Field investigations showed that miner influx also increased after increases in gold prices. These findings extend our understanding of the rate and scale of development in the closed ASGM sector and the driving factors behind these changes. Our results provide significant insight into the potential rates and levels of socio-environmental pollution at local and community levels.

TI  - Absence of Surface Water Temperature Trends in Lake Kinneret despite Present Atmospheric Warming: Comparisons with Dead Sea Trends
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km x 1 km resolution records on board Terra and Aqua satellites and in-situ measurements during the period (2003-2019). In spite of the presence of increasing atmospheric warming, in summer when evaporation is maximal, in fresh-water Lake Kinneret, satellite data revealed the absence of surface water temperature (SWT) trends. The absence of SWT trends in the presence of increasing atmospheric warming is an indication of the influence of increasing evaporation on SWT trends. The increasing water cooling, due to the above-mentioned increasing evaporation, compensated for increasing heating of surface water by regional atmospheric warming, resulting in the absence of SWT trends. In contrast to fresh-water Lake Kinneret, in the hypersaline Dead Sea, located similar to 100 km apart, MODIS records showed an increasing trend of 0.8 degrees C decade(-1) in summer SWT during the same study period. The presence of increasing SWT trends in the presence of increasing atmospheric warming is an indication of the absence of steadily increasing evaporation in the Dead Sea. This is supported by a constant drop in Dead Sea water level at the rate of similar to 1 m/year from year to year during the last 25-year period (1995-2020). In summer, in contrast to satellite measurements, in-situ measurements of near-surface water temperature in Lake Kinneret showed an increasing trend of 0.7 degrees C decade(-1).

TI  - Hydraulic Model Calibration Using CryoSat-2 Observations in the Zambezi Catchment
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Geodetic altimeters provide unique observations of the river surface longitudinal profile due to their long repeat periods and densely spaced ground tracks. This information is valuable for calibrating hydraulic model parameters, and thus, for producing reliable simulations of water level for flood forecasting and river management, particularly in poorly instrumented catchments. In this study, we present an efficient calibration approach for hydraulic models based on a steady-state hydraulic solver and CryoSat-2 observations. In order to ensure that only coherent forcing/observation pairs are considered in the calibration, we first propose an outlier filtering approach for CryoSat-2 observations in data-scarce regions using a simulated runoff produced by a hydrologic model. In the hydraulic calibration, a steady-state solver computes the water surface elevation (WSE) profile along the river for selected discharges corresponding to the days of CryoSat-2 overpass. In synthetic calibration experiments, the global search algorithm generally recovers the true parameter values in portions of the river where observations are available, illustrating the benefit of dense spatial sampling from geodetic altimetry. The most sensitive parameters are the bed elevations. In calibration experiments with real CryoSat-2 data, validation performance against both Sentinel-3 WSE and in situ records is similar to previous studies, with Root Mean Square Deviation ranging from 0.43 to 1.14 m against Sentinel-3 and from 0.60 to 0.73 against in situ WSE observations. Performance remains similar when transferring parameters to a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Because the approach is computationally efficient, model parameters can be inverted at high spatial resolution to fully exploit the information contained in geodetic CryoSat-2 altimetry.

TI  - Retrieval of Water Vapour Profiles from GLORIA Nadir Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first analysis of water vapour profiles derived from nadir measurements by the infrared imaging Fourier transform spectrometer GLORIA (Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere). The measurements were performed on 27 September 2017, during the WISE (Wave driven ISentropic Exchange) campaign aboard the HALO aircraft over the North Atlantic in an area between 37 degrees-50 degrees N and 20 degrees-28 degrees W. From each nadir recording of the 2-D imaging spectrometer, the spectral radiances of all non-cloudy pixels have been averaged after application of a newly developed cloud filter. From these mid-infrared nadir spectra, vertical profiles of H2O have been retrieved with a vertical resolution corresponding to five degrees of freedom below the aircraft. Uncertainties in radiometric calibration, temperature and spectroscopy have been identified as dominating error sources. Comparing retrievals resulting from two different a priori assumptions (constant exponential vs. ERA 5 reanalysis data) revealed parts of the flight where the observations clearly show inconsistencies with the ERA 5 water vapour fields. Further, a water vapour inversion at around 6 km altitude could be identified in the nadir retrievals and confirmed by a nearby radiosonde ascent. An intercomparison of multiple water vapour profiles from GLORIA in nadir and limb observational modes, IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite data from two different retrieval processors, and radiosonde measurements shows a broad consistency between the profiles. The comparison shows how fine vertical structures are represented by nadir sounders as well as the influence of a priori information on the retrievals.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Property Valuation: A Data Source Comparison in Support of Fair Land Taxation in Rwanda
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data is increasingly applied across many domains, including fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA), where the focus is on fast, affordable, and accurate property information collection. Property valuation, as one of the main functions of land administration systems, is influenced by locational, physical, legal, and economic factors. Despite the importance of property valuation to economic development, there are often no standardized rules or strict data requirements for property valuation for taxation in developing contexts, such as Rwanda. This study aims at assessing different remote sensing data in support of developing a new approach for property valuation for taxation in Rwanda; one that aligns with the FFPLA philosophy. Three different remote sensing technologies, (i) aerial images acquired with a digital camera, (ii) WorldView2 satellite images, and (iii) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images obtained with a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus quadcopter, are compared and analyzed in terms of their fitness to fulfil the requirements for valuation for taxation purposes. Quantitative and qualitative methods are applied for the comparative analysis. Prior to the field visit, the fundamental concepts of property valuation for taxation and remote sensing were reviewed. In the field, reference data using high precision GNSS (Leica) was collected and used for quantitative assessment. Primary data was further collected via semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results show that UAVs have the highest potential for collecting data to support property valuation for taxation. The main reasons are the prime need for accurate-enough and up-to-date information. The comparison of the different remote sensing techniques and the provided new approach can support land valuers and professionals in the field in bottom-up activities following the FFPLA principles and maintaining the temporal quality of data needed for fair taxation.

TI  - Impact of Thermohaline Variability on Sea Level Changes in the South ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is responsible for the majority of the global oceanic heat uptake that contributes to global sea level rise. At the same time, ocean temperatures do not change at the same rate in all regions and sea level variability is also affected by changes in salinity. This study investigates 10 years of steric height variability (2008-2017) in the Southern Ocean (30 degrees S to 70 degrees S) by analyzing temperature and salinity variations obtained from the GLORYS-031 model provided by the European Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. The thermohaline variability is decomposed into thermohaline modes using a functional Principal Component Analysis. Thermohaline modes provide a natural basis to decompose the joint temperature-salinity vertical profiles into a sum of vertical modes weighted by their respective principal components that can be related to steric height. Interannual steric height trends are found to differ significantly between subtropical and subpolar regions, simultaneously with a shift from a thermohaline stratification dominated by the first "thermal" mode in the north to the second 'saline' mode in the South. The Polar Front appears as a natural boundary between the two regions, where steric height variations are minimized Despite higher melt rates and atmospheric temperatures, steric height in Antarctic waters (0-2,000 m) has dropped since 2008 due to higher salt content in the surface and upper intermediate layer and partially colder waters, while subtropical waters farther north have mostly risen due to increased heat storage.Plain Language Summary Sea level variations on longer timescales mainly arise from mass changes or the thermo- and halosteric effects of temperature and salinity on water density. Recent variability in steric height in the Southern Ocean was investigated from 2008 to 2017 by analyzing potential temperature and salinity variations obtained from a global ocean reanalysis. The work was performed using a functional approach to a standard Principal Component Analysis that was applied on vertical temperature and salinity profiles (2,000 m). The resulting thermohaline modes contain information about the general temperature and salinity structure and their variations can be attributed to steric height changes. The results have shown that Antarctic waters above 2,000 m have dropped since 2008 due to higher salt content and colder waters, while subtropical waters farther north have mostly risen due to increased heat storage. Those spatial differences in recent steric height trends also display on the total sea level rise (SLR) observed from satellite data, which shows a significantly higher rate of SLR in subtropical waters compared to higher latitudes of the Southern Ocean.

TI  - Multiple Images Improve Lake CDOM Estimation: Building Better Landsat 8 Empirical Algorithms across Southern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important water property for lake management. Remote sensing using empirical algorithms has been used to estimate CDOM, with previous studies relying on coordinated field campaigns that coincided with satellite overpass. However, this requirement reduces the maximum possible sample size for model calibration. New satellites and advances in cloud computing platforms offer opportunities to revisit assumptions about methods used for empirical algorithm calibration. Here, we explore the opportunities and limits of using median values of Landsat 8 satellite images across southern Canada to estimate CDOM. We compare models created using an expansive view of satellite image availability with those emphasizing a tight timing between the date of field sampling and the date of satellite overpass. Models trained on median band values from across multiple summer seasons performed better (adjusted R-2 = 0.70, N = 233) than models for which imagery was constrained to a 30-day time window (adjusted R-2 = 0.45). Model fit improved rapidly when incorporating more images, producing a model at a national scale that performed comparably to others found in more limited spatial extents. This research indicated that dense satellite imagery holds new promise for understanding relationships between in situ CDOM and satellite reflectance data across large areas.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Based on Different MaChine Learning Methods in Zhaoping County of Eastern Guangxi
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regarding the ever increasing and frequent occurrence of serious landslide disaster in eastern Guangxi, the current study was implemented to adopt support vector machines (SVM), particle swarm optimization support vector machines (PSO-SVM), random forest (RF), and particle swarm optimization random forest (PSO-RF) methods to assess landslide susceptibility in Zhaoping County. To this end, 10 landslide disaster-related variables including digital elevation model (DEM)-derived, meteorology-derived, Landsat8-derived, geology-derived, and human activities factors were provided. Of 345 landslide disaster locations found, 70% were used to train the models, and the rest of them were performed for model verification. The aforementioned four models were run, and landslide susceptibility evaluation maps were produced. Then, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, statistical analysis, and field investigation were performed to test and verify the efficiency of these models. Analysis and comparison of the results denoted that all four landslide models performed well for the landslide susceptibility evaluation as indicated by the area under curve (AUC) values of ROC curves from 0.863 to 0.934. Among them, it has been shown that the PSO-RF model has the highest accuracy in comparison to other landslide models, followed by the PSO-SVM model, the RF model, and the SVM model. Moreover, the results also showed that the PSO algorithm has a good effect on SVM and RF models. Furthermore, the landslide models devolved in the present study are promising methods that could be transferred to other regions for landslide susceptibility evaluation. In addition, the evaluation results can provide suggestions for disaster reduction and prevention in Zhaoping County of eastern Guangxi.

TI  - CHANGES OF SOIL MOISTURE DURING APPLE GROWTH BASED ON TVDI INDEX
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on MODIS data, soil moisture data and field survey data from 2014 to 2018, the consistency of vegetation water supply index (VSWI) and soil moisture at 15cm depth (SM) in apple growth in Fuxian county was investigated. Results showed that the spatial and temporal consistency between VSWI and SM calculated by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was best; the sensitivity of remote sensing indexes to soil moisture was different in different apple growth stages. The sensitivity of VSWI was the most obvious in different growth stages, and the sensitivity of soil moisture was higher than that of germination, flowering, fruit expansion and maturity. The research findings were consistent with the law of water demand in different growth stages of apple in Fuxian county and the characteristics of precipitation and drought in Fuxian county. The present results could provide a reference for soil moisture monitoring of apple growth by remote sensing.

TI  - AESTHETICS OF HETEROGENEOUS IMAGE
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aesthetic preferences of contemporary art connoisseurs can hardly be called uniform. In view of this, today, heterogeneity, designed for a wide audience, is increasingly becoming a common technique. However, a question arises as to the reasons for the popularity of such eclecticism and ambiguity in the formation of an artistic image.The article is an attempt to scientific understanding of the formation and development of perception of images that differ in containing two or more strongly pronounced equivalent origins, which may exist with each other in contrast or be antagonistic.A specific character of understanding the meaning of heterogeneous images is rooted in the biological characteristics of human thinking and is directly dependent on the process of perception. The complexity of the polymorphic image lies in the impossibility of its unambiguous perception and identification. The aesthetic conflict is caused by the impossibility of correlating the image obtained in the process of perception with the norm, as well as the difficulty of checking the information presented in practice. This is a fair pattern: as perception influenced culture, so did culture affect perception.The nature of heterogeneity is explained by getting deep into the features of a primitive man's worldview and is expressed in myth-making, which, by virtue of a certain instinct, creates a pure image. The images formed at the early stages develop on the border of the antagonistic categories of the sublime and the base, the beautiful and the ugly, which makes them extremely contradictory. However, they exist in consciousness as long as these discrepancies are noticed by a man, but are perceived naturally.Subsequently, heterogeneity begins to acquire a comic character, is used as an allegory, and through the use of the method of deformation becomes a powerful spokesman for the human essence.Modern perception of heterogeneity can be represented in two manifestations. On the one hand, a tendency has developed to harmoniously merge the heterogeneous into a single system. A clear definition of the boundaries of the elements made it possible later on to come to the collage art, able to synthesize even the most contradictory things. On the other hand, the fragmentation of an already holistic image was used in order to give it heterogeneity. These transformations have found the most vivid embodiment in painting, literature, cinematographic art.The creation of a heterogeneous image in contemporary art allows us to trace the change in the perception by society of the phenomenon of hybridity, its mood to accept such changes and openness to heterogeneity. Indeed, for the modern viewer, the aestheticization of heterogeneity becomes quite expected, is not filled with satire, loses ugliness. It gives hope for the attainment of happiness and power, which forms the basis for the increasing popularity of polymorphic images.

T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal variability of mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) formed over southern Western Siberia for the period 2010-2019 has been assessed. During the period of study a total of 279 cases of MCCs were recorded, and two centers having the highest occurrence of MCC were identified. The first repeatability maximum is observed over the northwestern slopes of the Altai Mountains, the Salair Range and the Baraba Lowland, and the second is located over the southern Omsk Region. It was found that higher MCC repeatability over the northwestern Altai Mountains is represented by the air mass genetic type, whereas the MCCs, occurring over the Salair ridge and the Baraba lowland, are related to the frontal type. When evaluating the characteristics of the MCC, it was revealed that the areas of the air mass MCCs are smaller than for the frontal ones, but their cloud top height and the cloud effective radius is higher than for the frontal ones.

TI  - Analysis of Forest Stand Resistance to Insect Attack According to Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for analyzing the resistance of large woodlands (such as Siberian taiga forests) to insect attacks based on remote sensing data are proposed. As an indicator of woodland's resistance, we suggest a function of normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) susceptibility to changes in the land surface temperature (LST). Both NDVI and LST are obtained via the TERRA/AQUA satellite system. This indicator function was calculated as the spectral transfer function of the response in the integral equation connecting the changes in NDVI and LST. The analysis was carried out for two test sites, both of which are fir stands of the Krasnoyarsk region taiga zone. In the first case, the fir stands have suffered damage inflicted by Siberian silk moth caterpillars, Dendrolimus sibiricus Tschetv. since 2015. Adjacent intact fir forest areas were also analyzed. In the second case, the object of the study was a fir tree site damaged by Black Fir Sawyer Monochamus urussovii Fischer in 2013. It is demonstrated that the above-mentioned indicator function changed significantly 2-3 years prior to the pest population outbreaks, and therefore this indicator function can be used to assess the risk of pest population outbreak. Thereby, the proposed indicator compares favorably with vegetation cover estimates using NDVI, which register significant defoliation of tree stands and cannot be used for forecasting.

TI  - INTERPRETATION OF ACMEISTIC TRADITIONS IN V. SHALAMOV'S POETRY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the influence of acmeistic patterns on V. Shalamovpoet's artistic consciousness. The study involves Shalamov's epistolary and memoirs heritage (letters to N. Mandelstam, N. Stolyarova, essay "Akhmatova," etc.), where the author reflected on the significance of acmeistic literary tradition, as well as put forward his own understanding of acmeism - not only as an artistic direction, but also as a kind of "life teaching," a worldview system. One may trace the inheritance of acmeistic principles in Shalamov's work at different levels. The paper seeks to identify and systematize acmeistic influences in poet's consciousness. First of all, we are talking about the installation on the "fight for this world" (according to S. Gorodetsky): the multifaceted representation of the phenomena of environmental reality in its colors, forms and subject details. Shalamov inherits this principle, so that the objects of reality play a paramount role in his poetry system and receive no less distinct and large embodiment than in the work of acmeists. Such an arrangement is carried out by Shalamov in contrasting aspects: on the one hand, the imprinting of terrible world in which man barely survives and to which he seeks to resist;.n the other hand, even in the most adverse circumstances of imprisonment, the poet saw and felt the harmony and greatness of nature. The connection with the acmeistic thinking in Shalamov's works is also expressed in the fact that his images are almost always substantive and tangible (this feature manifested itself as early as in the first poem of "Kolyma notebooks"). As in the lyrics of acmeists, he often refracted the inner world through external, spiritual experiences - through the prism of the subject plan (the principle that was realized brightly in the lyrics of A. Akhmatova). It is not often that the reader finds "pure" lyrical monologues, much more typical for Shalamov`s creative tactics - to characterize the internal state through a chain of real images. Acmeistic logic could be traced in the interpretation of a number of important topics, among which the theme of creativity (characteristic features of its interpretation are shown in the article on the example of poems "Ode to Loaf," "May it be clumsily uneven.," "By ungainly prisoner step..."). The paper addresses such a significant aspect (also linking the poet to the acmeistic tradition) as a bodily nature of the figurative world. Finally, important feature of acmeistic thinking, which is inherited by Shalamov, is the obvious appeal of his creativity to the interlocutor, the focus on the reader (this feature is immanent, certainly, not only in the consciousness of akmeists, but it has fundamental significance in their creativity). The study concludes that among the traditions influenced Shalamov-poet, the acmeist becomes one of the most important, most significant artistic and worldview guidelines.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Machine-Learning Techniques for Forest Degradation Caused by Selective Logging in an Amazon Region Using Multitemporal X-Band SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The near-real-time detection of selective logging in tropical forests is essential to support actions for reducing CO2 emissions and for monitoring timber extraction from forest concessions in tropical regions. Current operating systems rely on optical data that are constrained by persistent cloud-cover conditions in tropical regions. Synthetic aperture radar data represent an alternative to this technical constraint. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three machine learning algorithms applied to multitemporal pairs of COSMO-SkyMed images to detect timber exploitation in a forest concession located in the Jamari National Forest, Rondonia State, Brazilian Amazon. The studied algorithms included random forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), and multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN). The geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of logged trees and the LiDAR point clouds before and after selective logging were used as ground truths. The best results were obtained when the MLP-ANN was applied with 50 neurons in the hidden layer, using the ReLu activation function and SGD weight optimizer, presenting 88% accuracy both for the pair of images used for training (images acquired in June and October) of the network and in the generalization test, applied on a second dataset (images acquired in January and June). This study showed that X-band SAR images processed by applying machine learning techniques can be accurately used for detecting selective logging activities in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Evaluation of formation mechanism of lakes in terms of morpho-metric aspect; lakes region and their vicinity, SW of Turkey
T2  - EPISODES
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation mechanism of lakes located on the Lakes Region and their vicinity are assumed to have a tectonic origin but this assumption is still controversial. Because, tectonic movements, volcanic activity, and dissolution of limestone caused the formation of morphologically dif-ferent type lakes in the region. In this study, Lake Acigol, Lake Aksehir, Lake Beysehir, Lake Burdur, Lake Egirdir, Lake cavuscu, Lake Salda, and Lake Yarisli, located in the Lakes Region and their vicinity, were taken into consider-ation to evaluate their formation mechanism in terms of morphometric aspect. In the study, the lake surface areas are extracted from the Sentinel-2 satellite image by apply-ing the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Otsu Thresholding methods. Then lake morphology was quantified with morphometric metrics (Elongation Ratio, Compactness, Circularity Ratio) and Main Axis Orienta-tion. The relationships between morphometric parameters and tectonic activity were evaluated by using tectonically active fault lines bounding the lake areas. The results reveal that the digital morphometric approach taken here not only allows more accurate measurement of lake morphology but also sheds light to understand the formation mecha-nisms of lake areas.

TI  - Demographic and Behavioral Risk Factors Associated with Reduced Susceptibility of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> to First-Line Antimicrobials in South African Men with Gonococcal Urethral Discharge
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the predominant cause of male urethral discharge in South Africa, and escalating prevalence of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health concern both in-country and globally. We analyzed the demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics of 685 men presenting with gonococcal urethral discharge to sentinel surveillance clinics over a 3-year period (2017 to 2019) to determine the burden of factors that are known to be associated with N. gonorrhoeae AMR to first-line therapy (defined as group 1 isolates exhibiting resistance or reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins or azithromycin). Among 685 men with gonococcal urethral discharge, median age was 28 years (interquartile range [IQR], 24 to 32). Only two men (2/632; 0.3%) self-identified as homosexual; however, on further enquiry, another 16 (2%) confirmed that they had sex with men only. Almost 30% practiced oral sex and were at risk for pharyngeal gonococcal infection. In univariate analysis, male circumcision (odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.99) and recent sex outside the country (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.76) were significantly associated with having a category 1 N. gonorrhoeae isolate. In a multivariable model, only sex outside South Africa increased the odds of being infected with a decreased susceptible/resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolate (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.55). These findings warrant the intensification of N. gonorrhoeae AMR surveillance among recently arrived migrant and overseas traveler populations, as well as the inclusion of extragenital specimens for N. gonorrhoeae AMR surveillance purposes.

TI  - TIEOF: Algorithm for Recovery of Missing Multidimensional Satellite Data on Water Bodies Based on Higher-Order Tensor Decompositions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite research methods are frequently used in observations of water bodies. One of the most important problems in satellite observations is the presence of missing data due to internal malfunction of satellite sensors and poor atmospheric conditions. We proceeded on the assumption that the use of data recovery methods based on spatial relationships in data can increase the recovery accuracy. In this paper, we present a method for missing data reconstruction from remote sensors. We refer our method to as Tensor Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (TIEOF). The method relies on the two-dimensional nature of sensor images and organizes the data into three-dimensional tensors. We use high-order tensor decomposition to interpolate missing data on chlorophyll a concentration in lake Baikal (Russia, Siberia). Using MODIS and SeaWiFS satellite data of lake Baikal we show that the observed improvement of TIEOF was 69% on average compared to the current state-of-the-art DINEOF algorithm measured in various preprocessing data scenarios including thresholding and different interpolating schemes.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Lidar Data Applied to the Urban Land Cover Machine Learning and Neural-Network-Based Classification: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid technological advances in airborne hyperspectral and lidar systems paved the way for using machine learning algorithms to map urban environments. Both hyperspectral and lidar systems can discriminate among many significant urban structures and materials properties, which are not recognizable by applying conventional RGB cameras. In most recent years, the fusion of hyperspectral and lidar sensors has overcome challenges related to the limits of active and passive remote sensing systems, providing promising results in urban land cover classification. This paper presents principles and key features for airborne hyperspectral imaging, lidar, and the fusion of those, as well as applications of these for urban land cover classification. In addition, machine learning and deep learning classification algorithms suitable for classifying individual urban classes such as buildings, vegetation, and roads have been reviewed, focusing on extracted features critical for classification of urban surfaces, transferability, dimensionality, and computational expense.

TI  - Methodology for mapping soil salinity and halophyte cover using remote sensing data in Kerkennah, Tunisia
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A global increase in average annual temperatures above land and oceans has led to increasing sea levels, which has in turn caused flooding along the coastlines of the Kerkennah Islands, Sfax Governorate, Central-East Tunisia. Seawater actively seeps into the groundwater of these islands. This groundwater is used for crop irrigation, which has resulted in rapid salinization and degradation of the soil cover. Thus, the environment in the Kerkennah Islands is characterized by hypersaline soil that is densely populated by halophytes. The halophyte distribution can be studied by mapping and monitoring using a remote sensing approach. In this work, we focused on determining the normalized difference vegetation index, the automated water extraction index, and the salinity index (NDVI, AWEI, and SI, respectively) in images obtained by Landsat 8 in order to map the soil salinity and halophyte cover in this region using the QGIS, GDAL, and SAGA GIS software packages. To achieve accurate land cover mapping of the Kerkennah Islands, we devised a scheme for identifying halophytes according to a decision tree based on a spectral classification approach that exploits several spectral indices. A regression model was used to detect significant relationships between spectral indices and soil characteristics such as pH and EC. The dynamics of the soil salinity in the study region were estimated using SI9, as this approach is known to give accurate results. The results confirm the methodology for mapping salinity by halophytes.

TI  - Toward Establishing Integrated, Comprehensive, and Sustainable Meningitis Surveillance in Africa to Better Inform Vaccination Strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large populations across sub-Saharan Africa remain at risk of devastating acute bacterial meningitis epidemics and endemic disease. Meningitis surveillance is a cornerstone of disease control, essential for describing temporal changes in disease epidemiology, the rapid detection of outbreaks, guiding vaccine introduction and monitoring vaccine impact. However, meningitis surveillance in most African countries is weak, undermined by parallel surveillance systems with little to no synergy and limited laboratory capacity. African countries need to implement comprehensive meningitis surveillance systems to adapt to the rapidly changing disease trends and vaccine landscapes. The World Health Organization and partners have developed a new investment case to restructure vaccine-preventable disease surveillance. With this new structure, countries will establish comprehensive and sustainable meningitis surveillance systems integrated with greater harmonization between population-based and sentinel surveillance systems. There will also be stronger linkage with existing surveillance systems for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio, measles, yellow fever, and rotavirus, as well as with other epidemic-prone diseases to leverage their infrastructure, transport systems, equipment, human resources and funding. The implementation of these concepts is currently being piloted in a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa with support from the World Health Organization and other partners. African countries need to take urgent action to improve synergies and coordination between different surveillance systems to set joint priorities that will inform action to control devastating acute bacterial meningitis effectively.

TI  - Revisit the practice of lymph node biopsy in patients diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ before operation: a retrospective analysis of 682 cases and evaluation of the role of breast MRI
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The optimal axillary lymph node (ALN) management strategy in patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) preoperatively remains controversial. The value of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict ALN metastasis pre-operative DCIS patients was evaluated. Methods Patients with primary DCIS with or without pre-operative breast MRI evaluation and underwent breast surgery were recruited from single institution. The value of breast MRI for ALN evaluation, predictors of breast and ALN surgeries, upgrade from DCIS to invasive cancer, and ALN metastasis were analyzed. Results A total of 682 cases with pre-operative diagnosis of DCIS were enrolled in current study. The rate of upgrade to invasive cancer were found in 34.2% of specimen, and this upgrade rate is 23% for patients who received breast conserving surgery and 40.7% for mastectomy (p < 0.01). Large pre-operative imaging tumor size and post-operative invasive component were risk factors to ALN metastasis. Breast MRI had 53.8% sensitivity, 77.8% specificity, 14.9% positive predictive value, 95.9% negative predictive value (NPV), and 76.2% accuracy to predict ALN metastasis in pre-OP DCIS patients. In MRI node-negative breast cancer patients with MRI tumor size < 3 cm, the NPV was 96.4%, and all these false-negative cases were N1. Pre-OP diagnosed DCIS patients with MRI tumor size < 3 cm and node negative suitable for BCS could safely omit SLNB if whole breast radiotherapy is to be performed. Conclusion Breast MRI had high NPV to predict ALN metastasis in pre-OP DCIS patients, which is useful and could be provided as shared decision-making reference.

TI  - Crop Residue Burning in Northeast China and Its Impact on PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in South Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of crop residue burning in northeastern China on South Korean PM2.5 concentrations was assessed via weather conditions, air quality modeling (AQM), and PM2.5 composition data during two cases exceeding 35 mu g center dot m(-3) in November 2015. PM2.5 concentration simulations of Case 1 differed from observations by 3.7-17.6 mu g center dot m(-3), overestimating the levels by 6-36%; however, Case 2 varied by 20.0-59.8 mu g center dot m(-3) from observations, with a 53-91% underestimation. Case 1 was generally well simulated, whereas the Case 2 simulation failed because the emissions of crop residue burning in northeastern China, as confirmed through satellite analysis (MODIS fires and thermal anomalies) and previous research, were not considered. The portion of organic/elemental carbon ratio during Case 2 was 1.6-2.3 times higher than that of Case 1. These results suggest that it is necessary to consider the effects of crop residue burning in northeast China to establish countermeasures to improve air quality and air quality forecasting in South Korea.

TI  - Monitoring of Water Level Change in a Dam from High-Resolution SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurement of water levels and variations in lakes and reservoirs is crucial for water management. The retrieval of the accurate variations in water levels in lakes and reservoirs with small widths from high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images such as the TerraSAR add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X) and COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) are presented here. A detailed digital surface model (DSM) for the upstream face of the dam was constructed using SAR interferometry with TanDEM-X data to estimate the water level. The elevation of the waterline below that of the interferometric SAR (InSAR) DSM was estimated based on upstream face modeling. The waterline boundary detected using the SAR Edge Detection Hough Transform algorithm was applied to the restored DSM. The SAR-derived water level variations showed a high correlation coefficient of 0.99 and a gradient of 1.08 with the gauged data. The difference between the gauged data and SAR-derived data was within +/- 1 m, and the standard deviation of the residual was 0.60 m. These results suggest that water level estimation can be used as an operational supplement for traditional gauged data at remote sites.

TI  - Unveiling the Factors Responsible for Australia's Black Summer Fires of 2019/2020
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The summer season of 2019-2020 has been named Australia's Black Summer because of the large forest fires that burnt for months in southeast Australia, affecting millions of Australia's citizens and hundreds of millions of animals and capturing global media attention. This extensive fire season has been attributed to the global climate crisis, a long drought season and extreme fire weather conditions. Our aim in this study was to examine the factors that have led some of the wildfires to burn over larger areas for a longer duration and to cause more damage to vegetation. To this end, we studied all large forest and non-forest fires (>100 km(2)) that burnt in Australia between September 2019 and mid-February 2020 (Australia's Black Summer fires), focusing on the forest fires in southeast Australia. We used a segmentation algorithm to define individual polygons of large fires based on the burn date from NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fires product and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product (MCD64A1). For each of the wildfires, we calculated the following 10 response variables, which served as proxies for the fires' extent in space and time, spread and intensity: fire area, fire duration (days), the average spread of fire (area/days), fire radiative power (FRP; as detected by NASA's MODIS Collection 6 active fires product (MCD14ML)), two burn severity products, and changes in vegetation as a result of the fire (as calculated using the vegetation health index (VHI) derived from AVHRR and VIIRS as well as live fuel moisture content (LFMC), photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and combined photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV+NPV) derived from MODIS). We also computed more than 30 climatic, vegetation and anthropogenic variables based on remotely sensed derived variables, climatic time series and land cover datasets, which served as the explanatory variables. Altogether, 391 large fires were identified for Australia's Black Summer. These included 205 forest fires with an average area of 584 km(2) and 186 non-forest fires with an average area of 445 km(2); 63 of the forest fires took place in southeast (SE) Australia (the area between Fraser Island, Queensland, and Kangaroo Island, South Australia), with an average area of 1097 km(2). Australia's Black Summer forest fires burnt for more days compared with non-forest fires. Overall, the stepwise regression models were most successful at explaining the response variables for the forest fires in SE Australia (n = 63; median-adjusted R-2 of 64.3%), followed by all forest fires (n = 205; median-adjusted R-2 of 55.8%) and all non-forest fires (n = 186; median-adjusted R-2 of 48.2%). The two response variables that were best explained by the explanatory variables used as proxies for fires' extent, spread and intensity across all models for the Black Summer forest and non-forest fires were the change in PV due to fire (median-adjusted R-2 of 69.1%) and the change in VHI due to fire (median-adjusted R-2 of 66.3%). Amongst the variables we examined, vegetation and fuel-related variables (such as previous frequency of fires and the conditions of the vegetation before the fire) were found to be more prevalent in the multivariate models for explaining the response variables in comparison with climatic and anthropogenic variables.This result suggests that better management of wildland-urban interfaces and natural vegetation using cultural and prescribed burning as well as planning landscapes with less flammable and more fire-tolerant ground cover plants may reduce fire risk to communities living near forests, but this is challenging given the sheer size and diversity of ecosystems in Australia.

TI  - Influence of Surface Water on Desert Vegetation Expansion at the Landscape Scale: A Case Study of the Daliyabuyi Oasis, Taklamakan Desert
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is an important factor affecting vegetation change in desert areas. However, little research has been conducted on the effects of surface water on vegetation expansion. In this study, the annual spatial distribution range of vegetation and surface water in the Daliyabuyi Oasis from 1990 to 2020 was extracted using Landsat time-series images. Based on multi-temporal and multi-scale remote sensing images, several plots were selected to demonstrate the process of landform change and vegetation expansion, and the influence of surface water on vegetation expansion was analyzed. The results show that the vegetation distribution and surface water coverage have increased from 1990 to 2020; and surface water is a critical factor that drives the expansion of vegetation. On the one hand, surface water in the study area was essential for reshaping the riparian landform, driving the transformation of dunes into floodplains, and increasing the potential colonization sites for vegetation. However, landform changes ultimately changed the redistribution of surface water, ensuring that enough water and nutrients provided by sediment were available for plant growth. Our study provides a critical reference for the restoration of desert vegetation and the sustainable development of oases.

TI  - HIV non-occupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) usage among five key populations in China
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To examine the feasibility of non-occupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) as a national strategy for HIV prevention in China, we investigated nPEP usage and related sociodemographic and behavioural factors among five key populations at high risk of contracting HIV. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among five key populations from November 2018 to September 2019 in China using convenience sampling to recruit participants aged >= 18 years, self-reporting HIV status as either negative or unknown and providing written informed consent. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted. Results Our analysis included data from 2022 participants with a mean age of 35 years (SD=11.62). Only 57 (2.82%) participants had ever used nPEP. Sociodemographic and behavioural factors related to nPEP usage included populations (p<0.0001), age (p<0.05), education (p<0.05), nPEP knowledge (p<0.01), receiving conventional HIV prevention services (p<0.05) and HIV testing (p<0.05). A significant percentage (26%) of nPEP users used nPEP medication more than once. Challenges and concerns, such as multiple use of nPEP and syndemic conditions, were emerging. Conclusions Key populations in China had low nPEP usage rates. Female sex workers, people who use drugs, older and illiterate individuals with poor nPEP knowledge, not using HIV prevention services or never tested for HIV should be emphasised. Implementing nPEP services would be an important way to access high-risk individuals for intensive and tailored HIV prevention and intervention. Challenges of providing nPEP services and future study foci are highlighted.

TI  - Joint InSAR and Field Constraints on Faulting During the Mw 6.4, July 23, 2020, Nima/Rongma Earthquake in Central Tibet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accumulation and partitioning of crustal strain in central Tibet remain debated. July 23, 2020, Mw 6.4 earthquake in the Nima region (approximate to 86.864 degrees E/33.144 degrees N) thus provides an opportunity to gain insight into local, ongoing deformation. Here, we use Sentinel-1 SAR data to assess co-seismic deformation during that earthquake, and nonlinear/linear inversions to determine the location and geometry of the source and the finite fault slip distribution. The results show that the maximum surface subsidence was approximate to 25 cm, the causative fault had a approximate to N28 degrees E strike and approximate to 48 degrees dip eastwards, and that the largest normal slip, with a peak of approximate to 1.5 m, occurred between 5 and 10 km depths. Details of the earthquake surface rupture were derived from a UAV-based field survey. At three distinct sites, the high-resolution UAV images revealed discontinuous, approximate to N35 degrees E-trending arrays of fresh en-echelon cracks and <= 20 cm-high, free-faced normal scarps, along a approximate to 10 km-long, approximate to 20 m-wide zone following the approximate to vertically projected western limit of maximum interferometric synthetic aperture radar slip at depth. These results, consistent with an earthquake intensity distribution based on building damage inspection, show that 2020 earthquake only broke a short segment of the west Yibu Chaka normal fault, along the middle stretch of the 300 km-long Riganpei Co-Yibu Chaka-Jiangai Zangbo fault zone. Regional Coulomb stress changes suggest that larger, Mw 7+ earthquakes should be expected on the geomorphologically more prominent, approximate to 50 km-long normal faults bounding the east side of the Yibu Chaka lake pull-apart, and on the 120 km-long, sinistral Riganpei-Co fault to the southwest.Plain Language Summary 2020, Mw 6.4, Nima/Rongma earthquake provides new insights on crustal deformation across central Tibet. By combining Sentinel-1 SAR data inversions with a detailed, UAV-based survey of surface deformation in the field, we determine the geometry of the fault source, the finite fault slip distribution, and the length of the co-seismic surface rupture. These results, which are consistent with the earthquake intensity distribution based on building damage, indicate that this earthquake ruptured a deep, similar to 15 km-long patch of the northeast-striking West-Yibu Chaka normal fault. Primary normal slip (up to 1.5 m), mostly between 10 and 5 km depth, triggered extensional craking and smaller (<= 20 cm) dip-slip along a small, sub-parallel fault splay and a similar to 60 m-high ridge at the surface. The combined, regional Coulomb stress changes due both to the 2020 event and 2008 (Mw 6.4 and 5.9) earthquakes farther south imply that the broad, central Tibetan region north of Nima remains at risk of larger (Mw approximate to 7) events along the geomorphologically more prominent East Yibu Chaka and Riganpei Co faults to the northeast and southwest, respectively.

TI  - Optimization of Taxol Extraction Process Using Response Surface Methodology and Investigation of Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Taxol in <i>Taxus mairei</i>
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Taxus mairei is an important source for industrial extraction of taxol in China. However, the standard and steps of extraction are currently not uniform, which seriously affects the taxol yield. In the present study, the influence of four factors (methanol concentration, solid-liquid ratio, ultrasonic extraction temperature, and ultrasonic extraction time) on the taxol yield was successively explored in T. mairei. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the extraction process based on the single-factor experiments above. The optimal conditions were as follows: methanol concentration was 90%, solid-liquid ratio was 1:15 (g/mL), ultrasonic extraction temperature was 40 degrees C and ultrasonic extraction time was 60 min. Moreover, the twigs and needles from T. mairei with different tree ages were treated by the optimum extraction process, which further revealed temporal and spatial distribution of taxol in the reproducible tissues. Interestingly, the taxol content was relatively higher in needles of T. 'Jinxishan' (a cultivar from T. mairei with yellow aril, FY), but was less in FY twigs. The accumulation of taxol in twigs and leaves of females (with red aril, FR) was significantly higher than that of males (M); however, the content showed a decreasing trend with the increasing tree ages. Therefore, it is suitable to increase the proportion of female trees especially the FY leaves as raw materials for the industrial production of taxol from T. mairei, and the tree ages should be better controlled at 3-7 years.

TI  - Characterizing and attributing the vegetation coverage changes in North Shanxi coal base of China from 1987 to 2020
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining activities can lead to large-scale and high-intensity ecological disturbances, which not only destroy a large amount of land resources, but also cause ecological disturbances and environmental pollution problems, such as regional surface erosion and vegetation destruction. As one of the fourteen large coal bases in China, the North Shanxi coal base is in the ecologically fragile Loess Plateau. Under the influence of coal mining and urbanization, the ecosystem has been seriously affected. Vegetation is a direct or indirect driver of ecosystem change. In this study, Sen's slope analysis and Mann-Kendall trend test were carried out to characterize the trend and significance of vegetation coverage change from 1987 to 2020 based on remote sensing images, and the future tendency was predicted using the Hurst index method. Moreover, the effects of natural and human factors on vegetation coverage were explored. From 1987 to 2001, the vegetation coverage showed a downward trend, and it continued to rise from 2001 to 2020. The overall vegetation coverage showed an upward trend from 1987 to 2020, and the improvement areas are mainly concentrated in the southwest and southeast mountains. Future vegetation coverage in the North Shanxi coal base showed strong randomness. Regional vegetation coverage changes were closely related to climate factors, and the policy of "grain for green" have also played an important role, while coal mining didn't present great impact on vegetation coverage changes. Therefore, relevant land use policy recommendations are put forward.

TI  - PCNet: Cloud Detection in FY-3D True-Color Imagery Using Multi-Scale Pyramid Contextual Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud, one of the poor atmospheric conditions, significantly reduces the usability of optical remote-sensing data and hampers follow-up applications. Thus, the identification of cloud remains a priority for various remote-sensing activities, such as product retrieval, land-use/cover classification, object detection, and especially for change detection. However, the complexity of clouds themselves make it difficult to detect thin clouds and small isolated clouds. To accurately detect clouds in satellite imagery, we propose a novel neural network named the Pyramid Contextual Network (PCNet). Considering the limited applicability of a regular convolution kernel, we employed a Dilated Residual Block (DRB) to extend the receptive field of the network, which contains a dilated convolution and residual connection. To improve the detection ability for thin clouds, the proposed new model, pyramid contextual block (PCB), was used to generate global information at different scales. FengYun-3D MERSI-II remote-sensing images covering China with 14,165 x 24,659 pixels, acquired on 17 July 2019, are processed to conduct cloud-detection experiments. Experimental results show that the overall precision rates of the trained network reach 97.1% and the overall recall rates reach 93.2%, which performs better both in quantity and quality than U-Net, UNet++, UNet3+, PSPNet and DeepLabV3+.

TI  - MSNet: A Multi-Stream Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Spatiotemporal Fusion Based on Transformer and Convolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing products with high temporal and spatial resolution can be hardly obtained under the constrains of existing technology and cost. Therefore, the spatiotemporal fusion of remote sensing images has attracted considerable attention. Spatiotemporal fusion algorithms based on deep learning have gradually developed, but they also face some problems. For example, the amount of data affects the model's ability to learn, and the robustness of the model is not high. The features extracted through the convolution operation alone are insufficient, and the complex fusion method also introduces noise. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-stream fusion network for remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion based on Transformer and convolution, called MSNet. We introduce the structure of the Transformer, which aims to learn the global temporal correlation of the image. At the same time, we also use a convolutional neural network to establish the relationship between input and output and to extract features. Finally, we adopt the fusion method of average weighting to avoid using complicated methods to introduce noise. To test the robustness of MSNet, we conducted experiments on three datasets and compared them with four representative spatiotemporal fusion algorithms to prove the superiority of MSNet (Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) < 0.193 on the CIA dataset, erreur relative global adimensionnelle de synthese (ERGAS) < 1.687 on the LGC dataset, and root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.001 on the AHB dataset).

TI  - Dynamics of vegetation NDVI in Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle from 2000 to 2018
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of vegetation coverage was analyzed using the MODIS NDVI remote sensing data of the Chengdu -Chongqing Economic Circle from 2000 to 2018. Combined with the climatic indices ( temperature and precipitation) from the meteorological stations in the study area, the spatiotemporal variations of NDVI and the influence of climate on NDVI were analyzed. The results showed that the NDVI of vegetation in the Chengdu -Chongqing Economic Circle presented a significant enhancement from 2000 to 2018, with substantial spatial variations. The areas with vegetation degradation were mainly concentrated in the northwest and southeast of the Chengdu Chongqing Economic Circle, and areas with improvement were mainly distributed in the south and east. The annual NDVI was negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and positively correlated with precipitation. The impact of human activities on vegetation coverage cannot be ignored. Human activities improved vegetation, and areas with improved vegetation accounted for 95.33% of the total area. However, 61.66% of the region would have a trend of vegetation degeneration from improvement in the future.

TI  - Ecological security characteristics of main irrigated agricultural areas on the Loess Plateau based on remote sensing information
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological security is an important guarantee for the sustainable development of regional economy and society. We analyzed the change characteristics of fraction vegetation coverage (FVC) and remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) of four irrigated agriculture regions of the Loess Plateau (Yinchuan Plain, Hetao Plain, Fenhe River Valley and Weihe River Plain) based on the remote sensing data from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that the FVC decreased in the study area from 2000 to 2018. The variation trend of FVC differed among the four irrigated agricultural distribution areas. The RSEI of the whole area showed an overall downward trend, the RSEI of Yinchuan Plain (down 0.06) and Weihe River Plain (down 0.07) decreased significantly, and the RSEI of Hetao Plain remained stable. The RSEI of Fenhe River Valley showed an increased trend. The ecological stability of Yinchuan Plain and Fenhe River Valley was relatively low, the ecological environment of Hetao Plain was relatively stable, and the ecological environment of Weihe River Plain continued to degrade. The results were important for regional ecological environment protection and agricultural sustainable development.

TI  - Land use change and ecological environment effect of Danghe River source region
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change affects ecosystem structure and function. Evaluating the ecological environment effect of land use change can provide a basis for regional ecological protection. We analyzed the land use change, ecological environmental effects, and influencing factors of Danghe River source region, with Landsat remote sensing images in 1987, 1994, 2000, 2006, 2011 and 2017 as the main data source, using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and plant community survey methods. The results showed that from 1987 to 2017, the areas of natural pasture, marshland, and bare rock gravel land in Danghe River source region showed a decreasing trend, while the areas of marsh grassland, river surface, sandy land, glaciers and permanent snow exhibited an increasing trend. The area with excellent and good ecological grades increased by 14.26%, while the area with poor and inferior ecological grades decreased by 27.9%. The RSEI increased from 0.48 in 1987 to 0.57 in 2017. The 6 -year average value of RSEI in natural pasture, marsh grassland, and marsh was higher than that in sandy land and bare rock gravel land. The RSEI value of natural pasture, marsh grassland, and sandy land showed an overall upward trend, while that of marsh showed an overall downward trend, and that of bare rock gravel land had no obvious trend. There was a significant positive correlation between precipitation and the RSEI value of marsh grassland, natural pasture, and marsh land ( all P <0.05). There was no significant correlation between RSEI value of sandy land, bare rock gravel land and annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, livestock inventory (P>0.05). The superposition of climate warming, humidification and socio-economic factors promoted the evolution of landscape types and improved the quality of ecological environment in the Danghe River source region.

TI  - Coniferous Plantations Growing Stock Volume Estimation Using Advanced Remote Sensing Algorithms and Various Fused Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution prediction of growing stock volume (GSV) for supporting the sustainable management of forest ecosystems, is one of the most widespread applications of remote sensing. For this purpose, remote sensing data were used as predictor variables in combination with ground data obtained from field sample plots. However, with the increase in forest GSV values, the spectral reflectance of remote sensing imagery is often saturated or less sensitive to the GSV changes, making accurate estimation difficult. To improve this, we examined the GSV estimation performance and data saturation of four optical remote sensing image datasets (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, ZiYuan-3, and GaoFen-2) in the subtropical region of Central South China. First, various feature variables were extracted and three optimization methods were used to select optimal feature variable combinations. Subsequently, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), random forest regression, and categorical boosting algorithms were employed to build the GSV estimation models, and evaluate the GSV estimation accuracy and saturation. Second, Gram Schmidt (GS) and NNDiffuse pan sharpening (NND) methods were employed to fuse the optimal multispectral images and explore various image fusion schemes suitable for GSV estimation. We proposed an adaptive stacking (AdaStacking) model ensemble algorithm to further improve GSV estimation performance. The results indicated that Sentinel-2 had the highest GSV estimation accuracy exhibiting a minimum relative root mean square error of 20.06% and saturation of 434 m(3)/ha, followed by GaoFen-2 with a minimum relative root mean square error of 22.16% and a saturation of 409 m(3)/ha. Among the four fusion images, the NND-B2 image-obtained by fusing the GaoFen-2 green band and Sentinel-2 multispectral image with the NND method-had the best estimation accuracy. The estimated optimal RMSEs of NND-B2 were 24.4% and 16.5% lower than those of GaoFen-2 and Sentinel-2, respectively. Therefore, the fused image data based on GF-2 and Sentinel-2 can effectively couple the advantages of the two images and significantly improve the GSV estimation performance. Moreover, the proposed adaptive stacking model is more effective in GSV estimation than a single model. The GSV estimation saturation value of the AdaStacking model based on NND-B2 was 5.4% higher than that of the KNN-Maha model. The GSV distribution map estimated by AdaStacking model used the NND-B2 dataset corresponded accurately with the field observations. This study provides some insights into the optical image fusion scheme, feature selection, and adaptive modeling algorithm in GSV estimation for coniferous forest.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Atmospheric CO and O<sub>3</sub> Anomalies before and after Two Yutian <i>M</i><sub>S</sub>7.3 Earthquakes
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data were used to extract concentrations and volume mixing ratios (VMR) of CO and O-3 and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data associated with Yutian M(S)7.3 earthquakes on March 21, 2008, and February 12, 2014. Difference value and anomaly index methods and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model were used to simulate gas backward trajectories and analyze the relations between spatial and temporal variations in total columns of CO and O-3 (TotCO and TotO(3)) and earthquakes. Then, the causes of abnormal changes were examined. Maximum anomalies in TotCO and TotO(3) occurred one month before the 2008 earthquake and one month after the 2014 earthquake. Anomalies in TotCO and TotO(3) were distributed along or were consistent with the fault zone. Furthermore, during the abnormal period, the coefficient of correlation between CO and O-3 was 0.672 in 2008 and 0.638 in 2014, with both values significant at p<0.05. The correlation between TotCO and TotO(3) was also significant. The abnormal phenomena of TotCO and TotO(3) associated with the two earthquakes were attributed to underground gas escape, atmospheric chemical reactions, and atmospheric transportation caused by in situ stress in the generation of earthquakes.

TI  - Finnish teachers' approaches to personal worldview expressions: A question of professional autonomy and ethics
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates Finnish teachers' personal worldviews, by focusing on understanding what kinds of approaches teachers use concerning the visibility of their personal worldviews in an educational context. This issue is discussed in the light of teachers' professional autonomy and ethics, since these are two fundamental dimensions of teacher professionalism that are discussed a lot. The research was conducted using a qualitative attitude approach, and included interviews (N = 20) from Finnish in-service basic education class teachers. The results show that teachers use three different approaches where their personal worldview and its visibility in their work are concerned. When reflecting on worldview questions, there was uncertainty about balancing between practicing teacher autonomy and following teachers' official responsibilities. Teachers' personal worldview expressions were limited to the institutional worldview, which means in practice adopting norms and language of the worldview majority, and professional ethics was highlighted even more than autonomy when reflecting on the visibility of worldviews.

TI  - Atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub> Distribution Characteristics and Influencing Factors in Yangtze River Economic Belt: Analysis of the NO<sub>2</sub> Product of TROPOMI/Sentinel-5P
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has a great influence on atmospheric chemistry. Scientifically identifying the temporal-spatial characteristics of NO2 distribution and their driving factors will be of realistic significance to atmospheric governance in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). Based on the NO2 data derived from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 satellite (2017 similar to present), spatial autocorrelation analysis, standard deviation ellipse (SDE), and geodetectors were used to systematically analyze the spatial-temporal evolution and driving factors of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (NO2 VCD) in the YREB from 2019 to 2020. The results showed that the NO2 VCD in the YREB was high in winter and autumn and low in spring and summer (temporal distribution), and high in the northeast and low in the southwest (spatial distribution), with significant spatial agglomeration. High-value agglomeration zones were collectively and stably distributed in the east region, while low-value zones were relatively dispersed. The explanatory power of each potential factor for the NO2 VCD showed regional and seasonal variations. Surface pressure was found to be a core influencing factor. Synergistic effects of factors presented bivariate enhancement or nonlinear enhancement, and interaction between any two factors strengthened the explanatory power of a single factor for the NO2 VCD.

TI  - Using Artificial Neural Network Algorithm and Remote Sensing Vegetation Index Improves the Accuracy of the Penman-Monteith Equation to Estimate Cropland Evapotranspiration
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) can provide useful information for water management and sustainable agricultural development. However, most of the existing studies used physical models, which are not accurate enough due to our limited ability to represent the ET process accurately or rarely focused on cropland. In this study, we trained two models of estimating croplands ET. The first is Medlyn-Penman-Monteith (Medlyn-PM) model. It uses artificial neural network (ANN)-derived gross primary production along with Medlyn's stomatal conductance to compute surface conductance (Gs), and the computed Gs is used to estimate ET using the PM equation. The second model, termed ANN-PM, directly uses ANN to construct Gs and simulate ET using the PM equation. The results showed that the two models can reasonably reproduce ET with ANN-PM showing a better performance, as indicated by the lower error and higher determination coefficients. The results also showed that the performances of ANN-PM without the facilitation of any remote sensing (RS) factors degraded significantly compared to the versions that used RS factors. We also evidenced that ANN-PM can reasonably characterize the time-series changes of ET at sites having a dry climate. The ANN-PM method can reasonably estimate the ET of croplands under different environmental conditions.

TI  - A Framework for Actual Evapotranspiration Assessment and Projection Based on Meteorological, Vegetation and Hydrological Remote Sensing Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the most direct indicator of drought, the dynamic assessment and prediction of actual evapotranspiration (AET) is crucial to regional water resources management. This research aims to develop a framework for the regional AET evaluation and prediction based on multiple machine learning methods and multi-source remote sensing data, which combines Boruta algorithm, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, employing datasets from CRU, GLDAS, MODIS, GRACE (-FO), and CMIP6, covering meteorological, vegetation, and hydrological variables. To verify the framework, it is applied to grids of South America (SA) as a case. The results meticulously demonstrate the tendency of AET and identify the decisive role of T, P, and NDVI on AET in SA. Regarding the projection, RF has better performance in different input strategies in SA. According to the accuracy of RF and SVR on the pixel scale, the AET prediction dataset is generated by integrating the optimal results of the two models. By using multiple parameter inputs and two models to jointly obtain the optimal output, the results become more reasonable and accurate. The framework can systematically and comprehensively evaluate and forecast AET; although prediction products generated in SA cannot calibrate relevant parameters, it provides a quite valuable reference for regional drought warning and water allocating.

TI  - Conversion of Natural Wetland to Farmland in the Tumen River Basin: Human and Environmental Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play an important role in the terrestrial ecosystem. However, agricultural activities have resulted in a significant decrease in natural wetlands around the world. In the Tumen River Basin (TRB), a border area between China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and Russia, natural wetlands have been reclaimed and converted into farmland, primarily due to the migration practices of Korean-Chinese. To understand the spatial and temporal patterns of this conversion from wetlands to farmland, Landsat remote sensing images from four time periods were analyzed. Almost 30 years of data were extracted using the object-oriented classification method combined with random forest classification. In addition, statistical analysis was conducted on the conversion from natural wetland to farmland and from farmland to wetland, as well as on the relationship between the driving factors. The results revealed that a loss of 49.2% (12,540.1 ha) of natural wetlands in the Chinese portion of the TRB was due to agricultural encroachment for grain production. At the sub-basin scale, the largest area of natural wetland converted into farmland in the past 30 years was in the Hunchun River Basin (HCH), which accounts for 22.0% (2761.2 ha) of the total. Meanwhile, 6571.4 ha of natural wetlands, mainly in the Gaya River Basin (GYH), have been restored from farmland. These changes are closely related to the migration of the agricultural populations.

TI  - CAN RELIGIOSITY BE SENSED WITH SATELLITE DATA? AN ASSESSMENT OF LUMINOSITY DURING RAMADAN IN TURKEY
T2  - PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social scientists have long been interested in how religious beliefs and practices impact and are impacted by socio-political and economic processes. Most recently, scholarly attention has focused on the interplay between religiosity and local actors, events, and institutions. Until now, measures of religiosity have relied heavily on self-reports in surveys, but these cannot always be safely collected and tend to be costly. Even where available, survey-based measures may be too obtrusive and are rarely representative of sub-national units. Here, I propose an inexpensive method that uses satellite imagery to unobtrusively estimate religiosity across small geographic units. I hypothesize that night-lights are affected by the behavior of fasting Muslims during Ramadan, especially in places where daytime activities are otherwise unchanged (i.e., where there is no "day-night inversion"). I explore and confirm the validity of this measurement strategy in the Turkish case, using a series of high-quality surveys and electoral results, representing 973 administrative districts. I conclude with a discussion of the external validity of this method and an overview of the ethical concerns raised by the use of remote sensing to estimate religiosity, in the Muslim world and elsewhere.

TI  - Drainage canal impacts on smoke aerosol emissions for Indonesian peatland and non-peatland fires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has experienced frequent fires due to the lowering of groundwater levels caused by drainage via extensive canal networks for agricultural development since the 1970s. However, the impact of canals on fire emissions is still poorly understood. Here we investigate canal impacts on smoke aerosol emissions for Indonesian peatland and non-peatland fires by quantifying the resulting changes of smoke aerosol emission coefficient (Ce) that represents total aerosol emissions released from per unit of fire radiative energy. First, we quantified the impacts of canal drainage and backfilling on water table depth (WTD) variations using field data and then expanded such impacts from field to regional scales by correlating field WTD to satellite terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. Second, we estimated Ce from fire radiative power and smoke-aerosol emission rates based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire and multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction aerosol products. Finally, we evaluated the Ce variation with TWS anomalies. The results indicate: (a) Ce is larger in peatland fires than in non-peatland fires; (b) Ce increases significantly as TWS anomalies decrease for both peatland and non-peatland fires; and (c) Ce changes at nearly twice the rate in peatland for a given TWS anomaly range as in non-peatland. These phenomena likely result from the different fuel types and combustion phases prevalent under different moisture conditions. These findings support the Indonesian government's recent peatland restoration policies and pave the way for improved estimation of tropical biomass burning emissions.

TI  - Urban Building Extraction and Modeling Using GF-7 DLC and MUX Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban modeling and visualization are highly useful in the development of smart cities. Buildings are the most prominent features in the urban environment, and are necessary for urban decision support; thus, buildings should be modeled effectively and efficiently in three dimensions (3D). In this study, with the help of Gaofen-7 (GF-7) high-resolution stereo mapping satellite double-line camera (DLC) images and multispectral (MUX) images, the boundary of a building is segmented via a multilevel features fusion network (MFFN). A digital surface model (DSM) is generated to obtain the elevation of buildings. The building vector with height information is processed using a 3D modeling tool to create a white building model. The building model, DSM, and multispectral fused image are then imported into the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to complete the urban scene level, vividly rendered with environmental effects for urban visualization. The results of this study show that high accuracy of 95.29% is achieved in building extraction using our proposed method. Based on the extracted building vector and elevation information from the DSM, building 3D models can be efficiently created in Level of Details 1 (LOD1). Finally, the urban scene is produced for realistic 3D visualization. This study shows that high-resolution stereo mapping satellite images are useful in 3D modeling for urban buildings and can support the generation and visualization of urban scenes in a large area for different applications.

TI  - Glassboxing Deep Learning to Enhance Aircraft Detection from SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although deep learning has achieved great success in aircraft detection from SAR imagery, its blackbox behavior has been criticized for low comprehensibility and interpretability. Such challenges have impeded the trustworthiness and wide application of deep learning techniques in SAR image analytics. In this paper, we propose an innovative eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to glassbox deep neural networks (DNN) by using aircraft detection as a case study. This framework is composed of three parts: hybrid global attribution mapping (HGAM) for backbone network selection, path aggregation network (PANet), and class-specific confidence scores mapping (CCSM) for visualization of the detector. HGAM integrates the local and global XAI techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of DNN feature extraction; PANet provides advanced feature fusion to generate multi-scale prediction feature maps; while CCSM relies on visualization methods to examine the detection performance with given DNN and input SAR images. This framework can select the optimal backbone DNN for aircraft detection and map the detection performance for better understanding of the DNN. We verify its effectiveness with experiments using Gaofen-3 imagery. Our XAI framework offers an explainable approach to design, develop, and deploy DNN for SAR image analytics.

TI  - An Improved Method for Automatic Identification and Assessment of Potential Geohazards Based on MT-InSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) has been widely used for ground motion identification and monitoring over large-scale areas, due to its large spatial coverage and high accuracy. However, automatically locating and assessing the state of the ground motion from the massive Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements is not easy. Utilizing the spatial-temporal characteristics of surface deformation on the basis of the Small Baseline Subsets InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) measurements, this study develops an improved method to locate potential unstable or dangerous regions, using the spatial velocity gradation and the temporal evolution trend of surface displacements in large-scale areas. This method is applied to identify the potential geohazard areas in a mountainous region in northwest China (Lajia Town in Qinghai province) using 73 and 71 Sentinel-1 images from the ascending and descending orbits, respectively, and an urban area (Dongguan City in Guangdong province) in south China using 32 Sentinel-1 images from the ascending orbit. In the mountainous area, 23 regions with potential landslide hazards have been identified, most of which have high to very high instability levels. In addition, the instability is the highest at the center and decreases gradually outward. In the urban area, 221 potential hazards have been identified. The moderate to high instability level areas account for the largest proportion, and they are concentrated in the farmland irrigation areas, and construction areas. The experiment results show that the improved method can quickly identify and evaluate geohazards on a large scale. It can be used for disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Encoding Spectral-Spatial Features for Hyperspectral Image Classification in the Satellite Internet of Things System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image classification is essential for satellite Internet of Things (IoT) to build a large scale land-cover surveillance system. After acquiring real-time land-cover information, the edge of the network transmits all the hyperspectral images by satellites with low-latency and high-efficiency to the cloud computing center, which are provided by satellite IoT. A gigantic amount of remote sensing data bring challenges to the storage and processing capacity of traditional satellite systems. When hyperspectral images are used in annotation of land-cover application, data dimension reduction for classifier efficiency often leads to the decrease of classifier accuracy, especially the region to be annotated consists of natural landform and artificial structure. This paper proposes encoding spectral-spatial features for hyperspectral image classification in the satellite Internet of Things system to extract features effectively, namely attribute profile stacked autoencoder (AP-SAE). Firstly, extended morphology attribute profiles EMAP is used to obtain spatial features of different attribute scales. Secondly, AP-SAE is used to extract spectral features with similar spatial attributes. In this stage the program can learn feature mappings, on which the pixels from the same land-cover class are mapped as closely as possible and the pixels from different land-cover categories are separated by a large margin. Finally, the program trains an effective classifier by using the network of the AP-SAE. Experimental results on three widely-used hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets and comprehensive comparisons with existing methods demonstrate that our proposed method can be used effectively in hyperspectral image classification.

TI  - Application of Deep Learning in Satellite Image-based Land Cover Mapping in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Deep Learning Networks (DLN), in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has achieved state-of-the-art results in various computer vision tasks including automatic land cover classification from satellite images. However, despite its remarkable performance and broad use in developed countries, using this advanced machine learning algorithm has remained a huge challenge in developing continents such as Africa. This is because the necessary tools, techniques, and technical skills needed to utilize DL networks are very scarce or expensive. Recently, new approaches to satellite image-based land cover classification with DL have yielded significant breakthroughs, offering novel opportunities for its further development and application. This can be taken advantage of in low resources continents such as Africa. This paper aims to review some of these notable challenges to the application of DL for satellite image-based classification tasks in developing continents. Then, review the emerging solutions as well as the prospects of their use. Harnessing the power of satellite data and deep learning for land cover mapping will help many of the developing continents make informed policies and decisions to address some of its most pressing challenges including urban and regional planning, environmental protection and management, agricultural development, forest management and disaster and risks mitigation.

TI  - Quantitative Contributions of Climate Change and Human Activities to Vegetation Changes in the Upper White Nile River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation changes in the Upper White Nile River (UWNR) are of great significance to the maintenance of local livelihoods, the survival of wildlife, and the protection of species habitats. Based on the GIMMS NDVI3g and MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, the temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation changes in the UWNR from 1982 to 2020 were analyzed by a Theil-Sen median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test. The future trend of vegetation was analyzed by the Hurst exponential method. A partial correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship of the vegetation and climate factors, and a residual trend analysis was used to quantify the influence of climate change and human activities on vegetation change. The results indicated that the average NDVI value (0.75) of the UWNR from 1982 to 2020 was relatively high. The average coefficient of variation for the NDVI was 0.059, and the vegetation change was relatively stable. The vegetation in the UWNR increased 0.013/10 year on average, but the vegetation degradation in some areas was serious and mainly classified as agricultural land. The results of a future trend analysis showed that the vegetation in the UWNR is mainly negatively sustainable, and 62.54% of the vegetation will degrade in the future. The NDVI of the UWNR was more affected by temperature than by precipitation, especially on agricultural land and forestland, which were more negatively affected by warming. Climate change and human activities have an impact on vegetation changes, but the spatial distributions of the effects differ. The relative impact of human activities on vegetation change accounted for 64.5%, which was higher than that of climate change (35.5%). Human activities, such as the large proportion of agriculture, rapid population growth and the rapid development of urbanization were the main driving forces. Establishing a cross-border drought joint early warning mechanism, strengthening basic agricultural research, and changing traditional agricultural farming patterns may be effective measures to address food security and climate change and improve vegetation in the UWNR.

TI  - Advances of Local Climate Zone Mapping and Its Practice Using Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the context of climate change and urban heat islands, the concept of local climate zones (LCZ) aims for consistent and comparable mapping of urban surface structure and cover across cities. This study provides a timely survey of remote sensing-based applications of LCZ mapping considering the recent increase in publications. We analyze and evaluate several aspects that affect the performance of LCZ mapping, including mapping units/scale, transferability, sample dataset, low accuracy, and classification schemes. Since current LCZ analysis and mapping are based on per-pixel approaches, this study implements an object-based image analysis (OBIA) method and tests it for two cities in Germany using Sentinel 2 data. A comparison with a per-pixel method yields promising results. This study shall serve as a blueprint for future object-based remotely sensed LCZ mapping approaches.

TI  - Automated Water Level Monitoring at the Continental Scale from ICESat-2 Photons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the approximately 6700 lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km(2) in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), only similar to 430 (similar to 6%) are actively gaged by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) or their partners and are available for download through the National Water Information System database. Remote sensing analysis provides a means to fill in these data gaps in order to glean a better understanding of the spatiotemporal water level changes across the CONUS. This study takes advantage of two-plus years of NASA's ICESat-2 (IS-2) ATLAS photon data (ATL03 products) in order to derive water level changes for similar to 6200 overlapping lakes and reservoirs (>1 km(2)) in the CONUS. Interactive visualizations of large spatial datasets are becoming more commonplace as data volumes for new Earth observing sensors have markedly increased in recent years. We present such a visualization created from an automated cluster computing workflow that utilizes tens of billions of ATLAS photons which derives water level changes for all of the overlapping lakes and reservoirs in the CONUS. Furthermore, users of this interactive website can download segmented and clustered IS-2 ATL03 photons for each individual waterbody so that they may run their own analysis. We examine similar to 19,000 IS-2 derived water level changes that are spatially and temporally coincident with water level changes from USGS gages and find high agreement with our results as compared to the in situ gage data. The mean squared error (MSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) between these two products are 1 cm and 6 cm, respectively.

TI  - Spatial covariation between solar-induced fluorescence and vegetation indices from Arctic-Boreal landscapes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic-Boreal Zone (ABZ) is characterized by spatially heterogeneous vegetation composition and structure, leading to challenges for inferring patterns in vegetation productivity. A mechanistic understanding of the patterns and processes underlying spectral remote sensing observations is necessary to overcome these challenges. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) show promise for tracking productivity and disentangling links to the activity and distribution of chlorophyll at coarse spatial scales (e.g. 0.5 degrees), but their effectiveness for studying mixed landscapes characteristic of the ABZ remains unclear. Here, we use airborne observations collected during NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment to examine the spatial covariation between SIF, NIRv, and CCI at a scale (30 m) commensurate with the best available landcover products across interior Alaska. Additionally, we compare relationships among SIF and vegetation indices from spaceborne observations (TROPOMI and MODIS) resampled to a 0.01 degrees (similar to 1000 m) scale. We find that the strength of the SIF-NIRv linear relationship degrades when compared from the spaceborne to the airborne scale (R (2) = 0.50 vs. 0.26) as does the strength of the SIF-CCI linear relationship (R (2) = 0.30 vs. 0.18), though the degradation of SIF-CCI is less severe than that of SIF-NIRv. The relationship of SIF with either vegetation index is strongly dependent on landcover class at both airborne and spaceborne scales. We provide context for how further work could leverage SIF with reflectance indices measurable from a variety of platforms to improve mapping of vegetation dynamics in this ecoregion.

AB  - The distribution of stream sediments is usually considered as an important and very useful tool for the early-stage exploration of mineralization at the regional scale. The collection of stream samples is not only time-consuming but also very costly. However, the advancements in space remote sensing has made it a suitable alternative for mapping of the geochemical elements using satellite spectral reflectance. In this research work, 407 surface stream sediment samples of the zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) elements are collected from Central Wales. Five machine learning models, namely the Support Vector Regression (SVR), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) regression, are applied for prediction of the Zn and Pb concentrations using the Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral images. The results obtained based on the 10 m spatial resolution show that Zn is best predicted with RF with significant R2 values of 0.74 (p < 0.01) and 0.7 (p < 0.01) during training and testing. However, for Pb, the best prediction is made by SVR with significant R2 values of 0.72 (p < 0.01) and 0.64 (p < 0.01) for training and testing, respectively. Overall, the performance of SVR and RF outperforms the other machine learning models with the highest testing R2 values.

TI  - Applicability of Smoothing Techniques in Generation of Phenological Metrics of <i>Tectona grandis</i> L. Using NDVI Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on phenological metrics of individual plant species is meager. Phenological metrics generation for a specific plant species can prove beneficial if the species is ecologically or economically important. Teak, a dominating tree in most regions of the world has been focused on in the present study due to its multiple benefits. Forecasts on such species can attain a substantial improvement in their productivity. MODIS NDVI time series when subjected to statistical smoothing techniques exhibited good output with Tukey's smoothing (TS) with a low RMSE of 0.042 compared to single exponential (SE) and double exponential (DE). Phenological metrics, namely, the start of the season (SOS), end of the season (EOS), maximum of the season (MAX), and length of the season (LOS) were generated using Tukey-smoothed MODIS NDVI data for the years 2003-2004 and 2013-2014. Post shifts in SOS and EOS by 14 and 37 days respectively with a preshift of 28 days in MAX were observed in the year 2013-2014. Preshift in MAX was accompanied by an increase in greenness exhibiting increased NDVI value.LOS increased by 24 days in the year 2013-2014, showing an increase in the duration of the season of teak. Dates of these satellite-retrieved phenological occurrences were validated with ground phenological data calculated using crown cover assessment. The present study demonstrated the potential of a spatial approach in the generation of phenometrics for an individual plant species, which is significant in determining productivity or a crucial trophic link for a given region.

TI  - Mudra Yojana: A Step towards Creating Growth for Women Entrepreneurs in Micro Enterprises Sector
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The entrepreneurial acumen among people of a nation helps it to achieve economic growth and development. However, there should not be any gender disparity while nurturing entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country as "women entrepreneurs have emerged as new drivers for maintaining the growth and prosperity in developing economies". Although, women constitute "almost half of the population but there remains wide disparity in their economic status particularly in India". Hence, the Government of India has taken various initiatives for enhancing women participation in the entrepreneurial activities & partnering them in development of the country. Furthermore, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna (PMMY) is considered pivotal in this regard, providing special attention to extend credit to women entrepreneurs. Therefore, this descriptive study is an attempt to observe gender-wise entrepreneurship generated under the aegis of MUDRA scheme in different loan categories on the basis of number of accounts, beneficiaries and amount sanctioned. Further, the study found that the total number of women account beneficiaries increased substantially; however, at a decreasing rate in the given financial years and 70% of the total loan borrowers are women since the inception of the scheme and majority of these accounts are opened under Shishu scheme. Further, the study found that the share of amount sanctioned was higher in FY 2015-16 for women than the men counterparts, which gradually declined in the subsequent financial years.

TI  - Evaluation of basin morphometric indices and tectonic implications in sedimentary landscape, Central India: A remote sensing and GIS approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was aimed to investigate the morphometric indices and tectonic implications in sedimentary landscape of Wardha River sub-basin, Central India. Geologically, the study area is predominantly constituted with Vindhyan and Lower Gondwana sedimentary formations. In the study, IRS-1D, LISS-III satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used to compute morphotectonic indices viz., channel sinuosity (S), drainage basin asymmetry factor (AF), transverse topographic symmetry factor (T), basin elongation ratio (Re), drainage basin shape (Bs) and mountain front sinuosity (Smf) to determine the tectonic activity of the study area. The terrain parameters such as aspect, slope and relative relief, river longitudinal profile and topographic profile of the basin were also computed by using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of 30 m spatial resolution. The computed S index for 69 meandering locations ranges from 1.03 to1.97, and it indicates the foremost courser of the river sinuous to meandering. The Re value ranges between 0.47 and 0.74, and it suggests the active to slight tectonic implications in the study area. The Smf values range from 1.14 to 4.69, and it indicates that the study area had slight to active tectonic implication. The T values range from 0.06 to 0.94, and it also indicates the tectonic activity. The present investigation clearly demonstrates the potential of remote sensing and GIS-based approach in evaluation of morphotectonic indices, which reveals the implications of tectonic activity in sedimentary landscape of Wardha River sub-basin, Central India.

TI  - Snow Lapse Rate Changes in the Atlas Mountain in Morocco Based on MODIS Time Series during the Period 2000-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal distribution of snow cover metrics in a mountainous area is mainly related to the climatic conditions as well as to the prevailing morphological conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the altitudinal sensitivity of snow cover metrics using the MODIS Terra snow cover product (MOD10A1 v5). Annual snow metrics, including start of snow season (SOSS), end of snow season (EOSS), and snow cover duration (SCD) were extracted from snow-covered area (SCA) maps, which had been pre-processed using a cloud removal algorithm; the maps were of the Atlas Mountains, taken from the period of 2001-2016. In addition, a linear regression was applied to derive an annual altitudinal gradient for each snow metric in relation to various spatial scales in order to analyze the interdependency between snow and topography, and especially to assess the potential temporal trend of the snow gradient. Results indicated that elevation was the principal regulator of snow presence where snow was mostly accumulated above 2500 m. The annual altitudinal gradients for EOSS and SCD showed a marked negative trend beginning in 2007. However, the SOSS altitudinal gradient was marked by a positive trend. The mean SCD gradient for the entire Atlas Mountains decreased from 6 days/100 m to 3 days/100 m. This is a new and important finding since it may indicate the impact of climate change on the dynamics of snow metrics and provides guidance for water managers to better manage the snowmelt water with different terrain features.

TI  - Assessing the Use of Optical Satellite Images to Detect Volcanic Impacts on Glacier Surface Morphology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, about 250 Holocene volcanoes are either glacier-clad or have glaciers in close proximity. Interactions between volcanoes and glaciers are therefore common, and some of the most deadly (e.g., Nevado del Ruiz, 1985) and most costly (e.g., Eyjafjallajokull, 2010) eruptions of recent years were associated with glaciovolcanism. An improved understanding of volcano-glacier interactions is therefore of both global scientific and societal importance. This study investigates the potential of using optical satellite images to detect volcanic impacts on glaciers, with a view to utilise detected changes in glacier surface morphology to improve glacier-clad volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting. Roughly 1400 optical satellite images are investigated from key, well-documented eruptions around the globe during the satellite remote sensing era (i.e., 1972 to present). The most common observable volcanic impact on glacier morphology (for both thick and thin ice-masses) is the formation of ice cauldrons and openings, often associated with concentric crevassing. Other observable volcanic impacts include ice bulging and fracturing due to subglacial dome growth; localized crevassing adjacent to supraglacial lava flows; widespread glacier crevassing, presumably, due to meltwater-triggered glacier acceleration and advance. The main limitation of using optical satellite images to investigate changes in glacier morphology is the availability of cloud- and eruption-plume-free scenes of sufficient spatial- and temporal resolution. Therefore, for optimal monitoring and eruption prediction at glacier-clad volcanoes, optical satellite images are best used in combination with other sources, including SAR satellite data, aerial images, ground-based observations and satellite-derived products (e.g., DEMs).

M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing information and condensing the speed of information technologies constantly transforms the functionality of libraries (as information, cultural, educational organizations) to solve acute problems, for example, informational, cultural, educational and educational education and development of readers in the new information space.Modern society sets itself each time new tasks and methods for the development of pedagogical sciences, most often they are associated with an informational approach to learning, education and cognition. The impact of information processes on the education and training and retraining of new library and information professionals is acutely affected. Allocation of information pedagogy allows us to explore new information processes and pedagogical phenomena to develop the sectoral aspect of pedagogical science.Library pedagogy is aimed at training competent specialists in the field of library information and pedagogical activity, functionally oriented to the training, education, and development of library readers.Library and information activities accumulate in themselves different types of labor processes, representing the library as the center of cultural, social, informational and pedagogical beginnings. The authors of the work propose the formulation of scientific knowledge - "library and information pedagogy", as the most appropriate to the name of the "Library and information activity" training area within the framework of the current federal state educational standards 51.03.06 and 51.04.06 "Library and information activities".Library-information pedagogy is a comprehensive knowledge of library pedagogy, pedagogy in general, as well as information pedagogy, including: the pedagogical basis of library science, the information basis of information, library and educational processes, the information worldview, pedagogical competencies that will allow the use of new information and communication technologies in the theory and practice of library and information activities.The structure of library and information pedagogy is conditionally composed of three main components: the base, core and effect.Considering the fact that at present there is no such scientific discipline as library and information pedagogy, then for the modern generation of students, in the context of the implementation of professional standards, the transition to FSES 3 ++, the emergence of a new position "teacher-librarian", it could be very useful.So, the use of the library-information approach in pedagogy makes it possible to replace the traditional plane of the problematic of pedagogical research of the educational and educational processes with the problematics of library-information activity in the implementation of these processes.

TI  - Relationship between Biomass Burning Emissions and Deforestation in Amazonia over the Last Two Decades
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With deforestation and associated fires ongoing at high rates, and amidst urgent need to preserve Amazonia, improving the understanding of biomass burning emissions drivers is essential. The use of orbital remote sensing data enables the estimate of both biomass burning emissions and deforestation. In this study, we have estimated emissions of particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) associated with biomass burning, a primary human health risk, using the Brazilian Biomass Burning emission model with Fire Radiative Power (3BEM_FRP), and estimated deforestation based on the MapBiomas dataset. Using these estimates, we have assessed for the first time how deforestation drove biomass burning emissions in Amazonia over the last two decades at three scales of analysis: Amazonia-wide, country/state and pixel. Amazonia accounted for 48% of PM2.5 emitted from biomass burning in South America and current deforestation rates have reached values on par with those of the early 21st Century. Emissions and deforestation were concentrated in the Eastern and Central-Southern portions of Amazonia. Amazonia-wide deforestation and emissions were linked through time (R = 0.65). Countries/states with the widest spread agriculture were less likely to be correlated at this scale, likely because of the importance of biomass burning in agricultural practices. Concentrated in regions of ongoing deforestation, in 18% of Amazonia grid cells PM2.5 emissions associated with biomass burning and deforestation were significantly positively correlated. Deforestation is an important driver of emissions in Amazonia but does not explain biomass burning alone. Therefore, future work must link climate and other non-deforestation drivers to completely understand biomass burning emissions in Amazonia. The advance of anthropogenic activities over forested areas, which ultimately leads to more fires and deforestation, is expected to continue, worsening a crisis of dangerous emissions.

TI  - Determining Temporal Uncertainty of a Global Inland Surface Water Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation time series are well suited to monitor global surface dynamics. However, data products that are aimed at assessing large-area dynamics with a high temporal resolution often face various error sources (e.g., retrieval errors, sampling errors) in their acquisition chain. Addressing uncertainties in a spatiotemporal consistent manner is challenging, as extensive high-quality validation data is typically scarce. Here we propose a new method that utilizes time series inherent information to assess the temporal interpolation uncertainty of time series datasets. For this, we utilized data from the DLR-DFD Global WaterPack (GWP), which provides daily information on global inland surface water. As the time series is primarily based on optical MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images, the requirement of data gap interpolation due to clouds constitutes the main uncertainty source of the product. With a focus on different temporal and spatial characteristics of surface water dynamics, seven auxiliary layers were derived. Each layer provides probability and reliability estimates regarding water observations at pixel-level. This enables the quantification of uncertainty corresponding to the full spatiotemporal range of the product. Furthermore, the ability of temporal layers to approximate unknown pixel states was evaluated for stratified artificial gaps, which were introduced into the original time series of four climatologic diverse test regions. Results show that uncertainty is quantified accurately (>90%), consequently enhancing the product's quality with respect to its use for modeling and the geoscientific community.

TI  - Chamoli disaster: pronounced changes in water quality and flood plains using Sentinel data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan rivers are vulnerable to devastating flooding caused by landslides and outbreak of glacial lakes. On 7 February 2021, a deadly disaster occurred near the Rishi Ganga Hydropower Plant in the Rishi Ganga River, killing more than 100 people. During the event, a large volume of debris and broken glacial fragments flooded the Rishi Ganga River and washed away the Rishi Ganga Hydropower plant ongoing project. This study presents the impact of the Chamoli disaster on the water quality of Rishi Ganga River in upstream near Tapovan and Ganga River in downstream near Haridwar through remote sensing data. Five points have been used at different locations across the two study areas and three different indices were used such as Normalized difference water index (NDWI), Normalized difference turbidity Index (NDTI), and Normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), to analyze changes in water quality. Spectral signatures and backscattering coefficients derived from Sentinel-2 Optical and Sentinel-1 Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data were also compared to study the changes in water quality. It was evident from the water quality indices and spectral signatures that the flood plains changed significantly. Using spectral signatures and different indices, the water level in the Chilla dam canal near Haridwar was found to decreased after the Chamoli disaster event as the flood gates were closed to stop the deposit of sediments in the canal. Results suggest changes in water quality parameters (turbidity, chlorophyll concentration, NDWI) at the five locations near the deadly site and far away at Haridwar along the Ganga River. This study is a preliminary qualitative analysis showing changes in river flood plain and water quality after the Chamoli disaster.

TI  - ASTER-Based Remote Sensing Image Analysis for Prospection Criteria of Podiform Chromite at the Khoy Ophiolite (NW Iran)
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - A single chromite deposit occurrence is found in the serpentinized harzburgite unit of the Khoy ophiolite complex in northwest Iran, which is surrounded by dunite envelopes. This area has mountainous features and extremely rugged topography with difficult access, so prospecting for chromite deposits by conventional geological mapping is challenging. Therefore, using remote sensing techniques is very useful and effective, in terms of saving costs and time, to determine the chromite-bearing zones. This study evaluated the discrimination of chromite-bearing mineralized zones within the Khoy ophiolite complex by analyzing the capabilities of ASTER satellite data. Spectral transformation methods such as optimum index factor (OIF), band ratio (BR), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied on the ASTER bands for lithological mapping. Many chromitite lenses are scattered in this ophiolite, but only a few have been explored. ASTER bands contain improved spectral characteristics and higher spatial resolution for detecting serpentinized dunite in ophiolitic complexes. In this study, after the correction of ASTER data, many conventional techniques were used. A specialized optimum index factor RGB (8, 6, 3) was developed using ASTER bands to differentiate lithological units. The color composition of band ratios such as RGB ((4 + 2)/3, (7 + 5)/6, (9 + 7)/8), (4/1, 4/7, 4/5), and (4/3 x 2/3, 3/4, 4/7) produced the best results. The integration of information extracted from the image processing algorithms used in this study mapped most of the lithological units of the Khoy ophiolitic complex and new prospecting targets for chromite exploration were determined. Furthermore, the results were verified by comprehensive fieldwork and previous studies in the study area. The results of this study indicate that the integration of information extracted from the image processing algorithms could be a broadly applicable tool for chromite prospecting and lithological mapping in mountainous and inaccessible regions such as Iranian ophiolitic zones.

TI  - Assessing Wildfire Regimes in Indigenous Lands of the Brazilian Savannah-Like Cerrado
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian savannah-like Cerrado is classified as a fire-dependent biome. Human activities have altered the fire regimes in the region, and as a result, not all fires have ecological benefits. The indigenous lands (ILs) of the Brazilian Cerrado have registered the recurrence of forest fires. Thus, the diagnosis of these events is fundamental to understanding the burning regimes and their consequences. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the fire regimes in Cerrado's indigenous lands from 2008 to 2017. We used the Landsat time series, at 30 m spatial resolution, available in the Google Earth Engine platform to delineate the burned areas. We used precipitation data from a meteorological station to define the rainy season (RS), early dry season (EDS), middle dry season (MDS), and late dry season (LDS) periods. During 2008-2017, our results show that the total burned area in the indigenous lands and surrounding area was 2,289,562 hectares, distributed in 14,653 scars. Most fires took place between June and November, and the annual burned area was quite different in the years studied. It was also possible to identify areas with high fire recurrence. The fire regime patterns described here are the first step towards understanding the fire regimes in the region and establishing directions to improve management strategies and guide public policies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land use planning in rural settlements is elaborated under the Plan for the Development of the Settlement (PDS), aiming at socioeconomic development of family farmers and environmental sustainability. The objective of this research is to analyze the space-time dynamics of the vegetation cover and land use of the Facdo Estadual and Facdo/Bom Jardim settlements, in the municipality of Caceres-MT. For the elaboration of the space-time analysis of the settlements, images of the satellites Landsat 5, from the years of 1986, 1996 and 2006 and Landsat 8 of 2016 and Geographic Information System were used. The Anthropic Transformation Index (ATI) of the years studied was calculated. It was observed that there was a decrease in native vegetation due to the increase of livestock, and this practice occurs in the study areas before they were established in settlements and the ATI of the settlements in 1984 was a little degraded, and from 1996 it began to regulate in the settlement Facdo Estadual and in the following years for the Facalo/Bom Jardim. It was concluded that in the settlements studied the vegetation of wooded Savannah is predominant, with the presence of forested Savannah, that are being suppressed, due to the growth of the Planted Pasture for the maintenance of the dairy and cutting cattle, allowing the alteration of the landscape and implying in the reduction of the biodiversity of the Cerrado in the investigated areas.

TI  - Predicting Maize Yield at the Plot Scale of Different Fertilizer Systems by Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable maize yield prediction is essential for the agricultural supply chain and food security. Previous studies using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical or statistical models have prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, fertilizer information may also improve crop yield prediction, especially in regions with different fertilizer systems, such as cover crop, mineral fertilizer, or compost. Machine learning (ML) has been widely and successfully applied in crop yield prediction. Here, we attempted to predict maize yield from 1994 to 2007 at the plot scale by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., vegetation indices (VIs)), fertilizer data, and soil data to explore the accuracy of different inputs to yield prediction. The results show that incorporating all of the datasets using random forests (RF) and AB (adaptive boosting) can achieve better performances in yield prediction (R-2: 0.85 similar to 0.98). In addition, the combination of VIs, climate data, and soil data (VCS) can predict maize yield more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of all data and combinations of VIs and soil data). Furthermore, we also found that including different fertilizer systems had different prediction accuracies. This paper aggregates data from multiple sources and distinguishes the effects of different fertilization scenarios on crop yield predictions. In addition, the effects of different data on crop yield were analyzed in this study. Our study provides a paradigm that can be used to improve yield predictions for other crops and is an important effort that combines multi-source remotely sensed and environmental data for maize yield prediction at the plot scale and develops timely and robust methods for maize yield prediction grown under different fertilizing systems.

TI  - Warm Island Effect in the Lake Region of the Tengger Desert Based on MODIS and Meteorological Station Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeastern part of the Tengger Desert accommodates several lakes. The effect of these lakes on local temperatures is unclear. In this study, the effects of the lakes were investigated using land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data from 2003 to 2018 and air temperatures from meteorological stations in 2017. LST and air temperatures are compared between the lake-group region and an area without lakes to the north using statistical methods. Our results show that the lake-group region is found to exhibit a warm island effect in winter on an annual scale and at night on a daily scale. The warm island effect is caused by the differing properties of the land and other surfaces. Groundwater may also be an important heat source. The results of this study will help in understanding the causative factors of warm island effects and other properties of lakes.

TI  - Sentinel-2 images reveal functional biophysical heterogeneities in crop mosaics
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Identifying landscape structure and understanding its functions are crucial for biological control. However, the relationship between the crop mosaic phenological heterogeneity and crop phenology at the field scale remains a blind spot. This hinders the understanding of crop dynamics and associated biodiversity. Remote sensing images are commonly used in landscape ecology because they allow for regular fine-scale monitoring of large areas. Objective The objective of this study was to understand the influence of biophysical heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on crop phenology and biodiversity using optical satellite images. Methods Indicators of wheat phenology and biophysical heterogeneity were derived from Sentinel-2 images using the Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI). A landscape gradient was studied in 2017 and 2018 using six study sites in Brittany, Picardy (France) and Wallonia (Belgium). First, we analyzed relationships among the crop mosaic, landscape grain and biophysical heterogeneity. Second, we studied effects of biophysical heterogeneity on wheat phenology. Last, we used WDVI to estimate the distribution of two carabid beetle species. Results The biophysical heterogeneity derived from WDVI correlated strongly with the crop mosaic gradient and landscape grain. Biophysical heterogeneity appeared to benefit wheat growth in fine-grain landscapes but disadvantage it in coarse-grain landscapes during the stem-extension and ripening periods. Biophysical heterogeneity estimated the distribution of carabid beetle species accurately. Conclusion The biophysical heterogeneity metric is continuous, consistent across locations and crop types and enables to address ecological issues using freely available satellite images covering the Earth. Future studies could use this metric to study the dynamics of species.

TI  - FTIR Measurements of Greenhouse Gases over Thessaloniki, Greece in the Framework of COCCON and Comparison with S5P/TROPOMI Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2), methane (XCH4) and carbon monoxide (XCO) are presented for the first time at a mid-latitude urban station, Thessaloniki, Greece, using the Bruker EM27/SUN ground-based low-resolution Fourier Transform spectrometer operated according to the requirements of the Collaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON). Two years of measurements are presented and examined for seasonal variability. The observed XCO2 levels show the expected seasonal cycle (spring maximum, late summer minimum) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 12 ppm, with maximum values reported for winter 2021 exceeding 416 ppm. The XCH4 values are shown to increase in the second half of the year, with autumn showing the highest mean value of 1.878 +/- 0.01 ppm. The XCO levels, following anthropogenic sources, show high winter and low summer values, exhibiting a rise again in August and September with a maximum value of 114 +/- 3 ppb and a minimum in summer 2020 of 76 +/- 3 ppb. Additionally, methane and carbon monoxide products obtained from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), Sentinel-5P space borne sensor, are compared with the ground-based measurements. We report a good agreement between products. The relative mean bias for methane and carbon monoxide are -0.073 +/- 0.647% and 3.064 +/- 5.566%, respectively. Furthermore, a 15-day running average is subtracted from the original daily mean values to provide Delta XCO2, Delta XCO and Delta XCH4 residuals, so as to identify local sources at a synoptic scale. Delta XCO and Delta XCO2 show the best correlation in the winter (R-2 = 0.898, slope = 0.007) season due to anthropogenic emissions in this period of the year (combustion of fossil fuels or industrial activities), while in summer no correlation is found. Delta XCO and Delta XCH4 variations are similar through both years of measurements and have a very good correlation in all seasons including winter (R-2 = 0.804, slope = 1.209). The investigation of the X-gases comparison is of primary importance in order to identify local sources and quantify the impact of these trace gases to the deregulation of earth-climate system balance.

TI  - Diagnosis and epidemiology of winged scapula in breast cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Winged scapula (WS) is a critical complication of axillary surgery in patients treated for breast cancer, and is associated with pain, impairment of the upper extremity's function and poor performance in daily activities.Sources of data: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, Embase and Virtual Health Library databases from January 1, 2000 to December 1, 2020. Clinical studies evaluating the diagnosis and epidemiology of WS among breast cancer surgery (BCS) patients were included.Areas of agreement: The diagnosis of WS relies almost entirely on physical assessment. Studies have suggested a high variability in the report of the incidence of WS given the subjectivity of its diagnosis, and the different criteria used during clinical assessment.Areas of controversy: The diagnosis of WS in BCS patients remains a challenge given the lack of standardized diagnostic protocols. Physical examination cannot rely on one manoeuvre only, as itmay overlook patients with subtle injuries or overweight and contributing to the underreporting of its incidence.Growing points: BCS patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection experience a significantly higher incidence of WS than those undergoing sentinel lymph node dissection. The global incidence of WS after BCS is 16.79%. Additionally, the anterior flexion test and the push-up test are the most commonly performed diagnostic manoeuvers.Areas timely for developing research: Further studies should aim for objective diagnostic tests, especially when the condition is not evident.

TI  - Fine-scale altitudinal gradients influence the relationships between structural attributes and aboveground biomass in Central Africa
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in altitude effects on structural attributes and aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests. However, we continue to lack a clear understanding of relationships between structural attributes and AGB along altitudinal gradients in Central Africa. Using a new network of 76 permanent plots of 0.5 ha, the relationships between structural attributes and AGB were explored along fine-scale altitudinal gradients in the Republic of Congo. We chose four fine-scale altitudinal gradients (71-350 m, 350-550 m, 550-650 m, and 650-853 m) and measured the diameter and heights of 4192 trees with a >= 10 cm diameter and calculated the structural attributes and the AGB for each 0.5 ha plot. For a given diameter, trees were shorter and had narrower crowns in the altitudinal gradient of 71-350 m than in the other altitudinal gradients. The relationships between structural attributes and AGB differ along fine-scale altitudinal gradients, with higher stein density, wood density, crown depth, and AGB for the altitudinal gradient of 71-350 m. These results provide important advances in our understanding of the relationships between structural attributes and AGB along fine-scale altitudinal gradients in Central Africa. They should improve AGB estimates for the low altitudinal gradient when combined with other field and remotely sensed data sets in Central Africa.

TI  - Characterization of cloud microphysical properties in different cloud types over East Asia based on CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - By using four-year CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite data, the authors investigated cloud microphysical properties in three representative regions over East Asia, where models commonly suffer from great biases in simulations of cloud radiative effects. This study aims to provide an observational basis of cloud microphysical properties for the modeling community, against which the model simulations can be validated. The analyzed cloud microphysical properties include mass, number concentration, and effective radius for both liquid and ice phases. For liquid clouds, both cloud mass and number concentration gradually decrease with height, leading to the effective radius being nearly uniformly spread in the range of 8-14 mu m. For ice clouds, the cloud mass and effective radius decrease with height, whereas the number concentration is nearly uniform in the vertical. The cloud microphysical properties show remarkable differences among different cloud types. Cloud mass and number concentration are larger in cumuliform clouds, whereas smaller in cirrus clouds. By comparing cloud properties among the Tibetan Plateau, East China, and the western North Pacific, results show the values are overall smaller for liquid clouds but larger for ice clouds over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - NaturaSat-A Software Tool for Identification, Monitoring and Evaluation of Habitats by Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The NaturaSat software integrates various image processing techniques together with vegetation data, into one multipurpose tool that is designed for performing facilities for all requirements of habitat exploration, all in one place. It provides direct access to multispectral Sentinel-2 data provided by the European Space Agency. It supports using these data with various vegetation databases, in a user-friendly environment, for, e.g., vegetation scientists, fieldwork experts, and nature conservationists. The presented study introduces the NaturaSat software, describes new powerful tools, such as the semi-automatic and automatic segmentation methods, and natural numerical networks, together with validated examples comparing field surveys and software outputs. The software is robust enough for field work researchers and stakeholders to accurately extract target units' borders, even on the habitat level. The deep learning algorithm, developed for habitat classification within the NaturaSat software, can also be used in various research tasks or in nature conservation practices, such as identifying ecosystem services and conservation value. The exact maps of the habitats obtained within the project can improve many further vegetation and landscape ecology studies.

TI  - The Potential of Satellite Remote Sensing Time Series to Uncover Wetland Phenology under Unique Challenges of Tidal Setting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While growth history of vegetation within upland systems is well studied, plant phenology within coastal tidal systems is less understood. Landscape-scale, satellite-derived indicators of plant greenness may not adequately represent seasonality of vegetation biomass and productivity within tidal wetlands due to limitations of cloud cover, satellite temporal frequency, and attenuation of plant signals by tidal flooding. However, understanding plant phenology is necessary to gain insight into aboveground biomass, photosynthetic activity, and carbon sequestration. In this study, we use a modeling approach to estimate plant greenness throughout a year in tidal wetlands located within the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. We used variables such as EVI history, temperature, and elevation to predict plant greenness on a 14-day timestep. We found this approach accurately estimated plant greenness, with larger error observed within more dynamic restored wetlands, particularly at early post-restoration stages. We also found modeled EVI can be used as an input variable into greenhouse gas models, allowing for an estimate of carbon sequestration and gross primary production. Our strategy can be further developed in future research by assessing restoration and management effects on wetland phenological dynamics and through incorporating the entire Sentinel-2 time series once it becomes available within Google Earth Engine.

TI  - Predicting soil nutrient contents using Landsat OLI satellite images in rain-fed agricultural lands, northwest of Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nutrients are the key factors in soil fertility, which have important roles in plant growth. Determining soil nutrient contents, including macro and micronutrients, is of crucial importance in agricultural productions. Conventional laboratory techniques for determining soil nutrients are expensive and time-consuming. This research was aimed to develop linear regression (LR) models for remote sensing of total nitrogen (TN) (mg/kg), available phosphorous (AP) (mg/kg), available potassium (AK) (mg/kg), and micronutrients such as iron (Fe) (mg/kg), manganese (Mn) (mg/kg), zinc (Zn) (mg/kg), and copper (Cu) (mg/kg) extracted by DTPA in rain-fed agricultural lands in the northwest of Iran. First, 101 soil samples were collected from 0-30 cm of these lands and analyzed for selected nutrient contents. Then a linear regression along with principal component analysis was conducted to correlate soil nutrient contents with reflectance data of different Landsat OLI bands. Finally, the spatial distributions of soil nutrients were drawn. The results showed that there were linear relationships between soil nutrient contents and standardized PC1 (Z(PC1)). The highest significant determination coefficient with an R-2 value of 0.46 and the least relative error (%) value of 11.97% were observed between TN and Z(PC1). The accuracy of the other LR's developed among other soil nutrient contents and remotely sensed data was relatively lower than that obtained for TN. According to the results obtained from this study, although remote sensing techniques may quickly assess soil nutrients, new techniques, technologies, and models may be needed to have a more accurate prediction of soil nutrients.

TI  - Smoke Detection from Himawari-8 Satellite Data over Kalimantan Island Using Multilayer Perceptrons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The smoke from biomass burning on Kalimantan Island has caused severe environmental problems in Southeast Asia's primary burning regions and surrounding regions due to the overspread haze. To monitor the biomass burning aerosol plumes on Kalimantan Island, the high-temporal-resolution Himawari-8 satellite data were used in this study. However, studies are limited on smoke detection using satellite remote sensing for Kalimantan Island because of the difficulty caused by frequently occurring clouds and the lack of prior knowledge on applying traditional threshold methods. In this study, we used the multilayer perceptron (MLP) method to identify smoke over Kalimantan Island in August 2015, one of the most severe fire seasons. To prepare sufficient supervision information, a pixel-level labeled dataset was established based on the Himawari-8 data. Based on the labeled dataset, three MLP approaches and two sampling methods were applied to create training samples. A comparison between the detection results for the MLP approaches and classification tree analysis (i.e., CTA) showed that MLP is superior to CTA. The visualization results also showed that the detected smoke areas included those mixed with clouds. Some detected smoke is difficult to identify by the human eye, suggesting that the explanatory dataset built for this study is sufficiently comprehensive. Therefore, the pixel-level labeled dataset and MLP are suitable for regions that are frequently cloud-covered.

TI  - Application of a land use change model to guide regional planning and development in the south basin of the Urmia Lake, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers have to make decisions to adapt to climate change and reduce environmental vulnerability. If these decisions are made incorrectly, irreversible changes can take place that threaten environmental, social and economic sustainability of agriculture. This study applies a land use change model to guide regional agricultural land use planning, with a focus on the case of the south basin of the Urmia Lake, NW Iran, using data from Landsat images, statistics, questionnaire and checklist. The findings indicate the significant changes in the five factors, namely rainfall, humidity, minimum temperature, average temperature and maximum temperature. For example, the rainfall decreased more than 10 mm and the average temperature has increased by 3.5 degrees C in the last 30 years. The results of factor analysis showed that the studied variables were grouped into eight factors. These factors explained 57.4% of the variance of the determinant factors of farmers' behavior on climate change in the study area. The results obtained from supervised classification showed that all land uses have undergone many changes. The irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture have increased 79.43% and 82.5%, respectively, while water bodies, dense grass and woodlands, and sparse grass have declined sharply in the south basin of Urmia Lake. The forecasted results for the year 2027 show that if the existing situation continues, more crises will be faced in terms of land use change, since irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture are expected to grow by nearly 9000 ha and more than 1000 ha, respectively.

Analysis of altimeter data relies on highly-accurate knowledge of the orbital position and requires radial RMS orbit errors of less than 1.5 cm. For precise orbit determination (POD), the Sentinel-6A spacecraft is equipped with a dual-constellation GNSS receiver. We present the results of Sentinel-6A POD solutions for the first 6 months since launch and demonstrate a 1-cm consistency of ambiguity-fixed GPS-only and Galileo-only solutions with the dual-constellation product. A similar performance (1.3 cm 3D RMS) is achieved in the comparison of kinematic and reduced-dynamic orbits. While Galileo measurements exhibit 30-50% smaller RMS errors than those of GPS, the POD benefits most from the availability of an increased number of satellites in the combined dual-frequency solution. Considering obvious uncertainties in the pre-mission calibration of the GNSS receiver antenna, an independent inflight calibration of the phase centers for GPS and Galileo signal frequencies is required. As such, Galileo observations cannot provide independent scale information and the estimated orbital height is ultimately driven by the employed forces models and knowledge of the center-of-mass location within the spacecraft. Using satellite laser ranging (SLR) from selected high-performance stations, a better than 1 cm RMS consistency of SLR normal points with the GNSS-based orbits is obtained, which further improves to 6 mm RMS when adjusting site-specific corrections to station positions and ranging biases. For the radial orbit component, a bias of less than 1 mm is found from the SLR analysis relative to the mean height of 13 high-performance SLR stations. Overall, the reduced-dynamic orbit determination based on GPS and Galileo tracking is considered to readily meet the altimetry-related Sentinel-6 mission needs for RMS height errors of less than 1.5 cm.

TI  - Effect of Atmospheric Corrections on NDVI: Intercomparability of Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and UAV Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites constitute an unprecedented source of freely accessible satellite imagery. To produce precise outputs from the satellite data, however, proper use of atmospheric correction methods is crucial. In this work, we tested the performance of six different atmospheric correction methods (QUAC, FLAASH, DOS, ACOLITE, 6S, and Sen2Cor), together with atmospheric correction given by providers, non-corrected image, and images acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle while working with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the most widely used index. We tested their performance across urban, rural, and vegetated land cover types. Our results show a substantial impact from the choice of the atmospheric correction method on the resulting NDVI. Moreover, we demonstrate that proper use of atmospheric correction methods can increase the intercomparability between data from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.

TI  - The Role of Satellite InSAR for Landslide Forecasting: Limitations and Openings
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explores the potential of the satellite advanced differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (A-DInSAR) technique for the identification of impending slope failure. The advantages and limitations of satellite InSAR in monitoring pre-failure landslide behaviour are addressed in five different case histories back-analysed using data acquired by different satellite missions: Montescaglioso landslide (2013, Italy), Scillato landslide (2015, Italy), Bingham Canyon Mine landslide (2013, UT, USA), Big Sur landslide (2017, CA, USA) and Xinmo landslide (2017, China). This paper aimed at providing a contribution to improve the knowledge within the subject area of landslide forecasting using monitoring data, in particular exploring the suitability of satellite InSAR for spatial and temporal prediction of large landslides. The study confirmed that satellite InSAR can be successful in the early detection of slopes prone to collapse; its limitations due to phase aliasing and low sampling frequency are also underlined. According to the results, we propose a novel landslide predictability classification discerning five different levels of predictability by satellite InSAR. Finally, the big step forward made for landslide forecasting applications since the beginning of the first SAR systems (ERS and Envisat) is shown, highlighting that future perspectives are encouraging thanks to the expected improvement of upcoming satellite missions that could highly increase the capability to monitor landslides' pre-failure behaviour.

TI  - PS3: The Pheno-Synthesis software suite for integration and analysis of multi-scale, multi-platform phenological data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is the study of recurring plant and animal life-cycle stages which can be observed across spatial and temporal scales that span orders of magnitude (e.g., organisms to landscapes). The variety of scales at which phenological processes operate is reflected in the range of methods for collecting phenologically relevant data, and the programs focused on these collections. Consideration of the scale at which phenological observations are made, and the platform used for observation, is critical for the interpretation of phenological data and the application of these data to both research questions and land management objectives. However, there is currently little capacity to facilitate access, integration and analysis of cross-scale, multi-platform phenological data. This paper reports on a new suite of software and analysis tools - the "Pheno-Synthesis Software Suite," or PS3 - to facilitate integration and analysis of phenological and ancillary data, enabling investigation and interpretation of phenological processes at scales ranging from organisms to landscapes and from days to decades. We use PS3 to investigate phenological processes in a semi-aride, mixed shrub-grass ecosystem, and find that the apparent importance of seasonal precipitation to vegetation activity (i.e., "greenness") is affected by the scale and platform of observation. We end by describing potential applications of PS3 to phenological modeling and forecasting, understanding patterns and drivers of phenological activity in real-world ecosystems, and supporting agricultural and natural resource management and decision-making.

T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The drift of the large (length 160 km, area 5800 km(2)) A68A iceberg in the western part of the Weddell Sea is considered. Analysis was carried out on the basis of satellite images and field measurements in the region of the iceberg. The iceberg calved from the Larsen Glacier in July 2017 and slowly drifted northward. In February 2020, during cruise 79 of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, hydrophysical observations were carried out near the iceberg. The presence of an iceberg in the western part of the Weddell Sea caused displacement of currents and fronts to the west in the space between the iceberg and the Antarctic Peninsula.

TI  - Accurate Sea Surface heights from Sentinel-3A and Jason-3 retrackers by incorporating High-Resolution Marine Geoid and Hydrodynamic Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODETIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major challenges of satellite altimetry (SA) is to produce accurate sea surface heights data up to the shoreline, especially in geomorphologically complex sea areas. New advanced re-tracking methods are expected to deliver better results. This study examines the achievable accuracy of Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Jason-3 (JA3) standard retrackers (Ocean and MLE4) with that of improved retrackers adapted for coastal and sea ice conditions (ALES+ SAR for S3A and ALES+ for JA3). The validation of SA data was performed by the integration of tide gauges, hydrodynamic model and high-resolution geoid model. The geoid being a key component that links the vertical reference datum of the SA with other utilized sources. The method is tested in the eastern section of Baltic Sea. The results indicate that on average reliable sea surface height (SSH) data can be obtained 2-3 km from the coastline for S3A (for both Ocean and ALES+SAR) whilst an average distance of 7-10 km for JA3 (MLE4 and ALES+) with a minimum distance of 3-4 km. In terms of accuracy, the RMSE (with respect to a corrected hydrodynamic model) of S3A ALES+ SAR and Ocean retrackers based SSH were 4-5 cm respectively, whereas with the JA3 ALES+ and MLE4 associated SSH RMSE of 6-7 cm can be achieved. The ALES+ and ALES+ SAR retrackers show SSH improvement within a range of 0.5-1 cm compared to the standard retrackers. This assessment showed that the adaptation of localized retrackers for the Baltic Sea (ALES+ and ALES+SAR) produced more valid observation closer to the coast than the standard retrackers and also improved the accuracy of SSH data.

T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - Mostari A., Benabdeli K., Ferah T.: Assessment of the impact of urbanisation on agricultural and forest areas in the coastal zone of Mostaganem (western Algeria). Ekologia (Bratislava), Vol. 40, No. 3, p. 230-239, 2021. The accelerated and uncontrolled urbanisation in the coastal zone of Mostaganem is exclusively at the expense of agricultural and natural areas and is reflected in the aggravation of their degradation. The study area is a 62-km-long littoral to the west of Mostaganem and includes 11 municipalities. The Corine Land Cover nomenclature was used by exploiting data from Landsat satellite images over a 30-year period. The exploitation of statistics related to agricultural and forestry areas reveals a worrying dynamics. All spaces are under pressure mainly due to urbanisation. The phenomena of urbanization and coastalisation and the development of seaside tourism have increased the pressures on natural heritage to the point of compromising it. The analysis identified seven thematic object classes for the study area. An assessment of the dynamics of urban, forest and agricultural areas is an informative indicator of the sustainability of natural areas in the coastline of Mostaganem. The cultivated areas measured from 42,356 ha in 1985 to 38,301 ha in 2015,forest formations from 8207 ha to 9298 ha and urbanised areas from 2604 ha to 5049 ha. The dramatic land use change stimulated by rapid urbanisation in the study areas has resulted in a fundamental change in the landscape pattern. The thematic maps and the results obtained through different periods show that the predominant agricultural landscape has been gradually converted into urban areas.

TI  - Impact of the Change in Topography Caused by Road Construction on the Flood Vulnerability of Mobility on Road Networks in Urban Areas
T2  - ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART A-CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In urban watersheds, floods directly affect mobility on road networks. The present study proposes a methodology for analysing the impact of road construction or reconstruction on topography and, ultimately, on causing floods. The study first proposes a methodology to estimate the vulnerability to mobility on road networks due to flooding, illustrated on a road network in Nagpur city in central India. The study proposes the flood vulnerability road mobility index (FVRMI) through hydrologic modeling using parameters such as precipitation trends, the land use function, elevation models generated by satellite data, flood inundation depth calculated using the soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method, a time area histogram, and the flood-safe driving speed of a road network. Then, FVRMI was estimated for the changed topography observed through elevation models generated by satellite data due to road reconstruction from 2010 to 2018. Results show that this has affected the flow regime of the Nagpur urban watersheds. The estimated FVRMI was 20% higher for the changed topography in 2018 (Model II) than the topography scenario of the base year, 2010 (Model I). The results show that about 63% of road segments had a higher FVRMI value in 2018. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Stimuli-Responsive Nucleotide-Amino Acid Hybrid Supramolecular Hydrogels
T2  - GELS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to assemble chemically different gelator molecules into complex supramolecular hydrogels provides excellent opportunities to construct functional soft materials. Herein, we demonstrate the formation of hybrid nucleotide-amino acid supramolecular hydrogels. These are generated by the silver ion (Ag+)-triggered formation of silver-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) dimers, which undergo self-assembly through non-covalent interactions to produce nanofilaments. This process results in a concomitant pH reduction due to the abstraction of a proton from the guanine residue, which triggers the in situ gelation of a pH-sensitive amino acid, N-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl tyrosine (FY), to form nucleotide-amino acid hybrid hydrogels. Alterations in the supramolecular structures due to changes in the assembly process are observed, with the molar ratio of Ag:GMP:FY affecting the assembly kinetics, and the resulting supramolecular organisation and mechanical properties of the hydrogels. Higher Ag:GMP stoichiometries result in almost instantaneous gelation with non-orthogonal assembly of the gelators, while at lower molar ratios, orthogonal assembly is observed. Significantly, by increasing the pH as an external stimulus, nanofilaments comprising FY can be selectively disassembled from the hybrid hydrogels. Our results demonstrate a simple approach for the construction of multicomponent stimuli-responsive supramolecular hydrogels with adaptable network and mechanical properties.

M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of technological era, the scientists and researchers develop machine learning classification techniques to classify land cover accurately. Researches prove that these classification techniques perform better than previous traditional techniques. In this research main objective is to identify suitable land cover classification method to extract land cover information of Lahore district Two supervised classification techniques i.e., Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) (based on neighbourhood function) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (based on optimal hyper-plane function) are compared by using Sentinel-2 data. For this optimization, four land cover classes have been selected. Field based training samples have been collected and prepared through a survey of the study area at four spatial levels. Accuracy for each of the classifier has been assessed using error matrix and kappa statistics. Results show that SVM performs better than MLC. Overall accuracies of SVM and MLC are 95.20% and 88.80% whereas their kappa co-efficient are 0.93 and 0.84 respectively.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-1B Polarimetric Observations to Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Neural Networks: Case Study for Bare Siberian Chernozem Soil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 is currently the only synthetic-aperture radar, which radar measurements of the earth's surface to be carried out, regardless of weather conditions, with high resolution up to 5-40 m and high periodicity from several to 12 days. Sentinel-1 creates a technological platform for the development of new globally remote sensing algorithms of soil moisture, not only for hydrological and climatic model applications, but also on a single field scale for individual farms in precision farming systems used. In this paper, the potential of soil moisture remote sensing using polarimetric Sentinel-1B backscattering observations was studied. As a test site, the fallow agricultural field with bare soil near the Minino village (56.0865 degrees N, 92.6772 degrees E), Krasnoyarsk region, the Russian Federation, was chosen. The relationship between the cross-polarized ratio, reflectivity, and the soil surface roughness established Oh used as a basis for developing the algorithm of soil moisture retrieval with neural networks (NNs) computational model. Two NNs is used as a universal regression technique to establish the relationship between scattering anisotropy, entropy and backscattering coefficients measured by the Sentinel-1B on the one hand and reflectivity on the other. Finally, the soil moisture was found from the soil reflectivity in solving the inverse problem using the Mironov dielectric model. During the field campaign from 21 May to 25 August 2020, it was shown that the proposed approach allows us to predict soil moisture values in the layer thickness of 0.00-0.05 m with the root-mean-square error and determination coefficient not worse than 3% and 0.726, respectively. The validity of the proposed approach needs additional verification on a wider dataset using soils of different textures, a wide range of variations in soil surface roughness, and moisture.

TI  - The Global Landscape of Pediatric Bacterial Meningitis Data Reported to the World Health Organization-Coordinated Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Network, 2014-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates the Global Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (IB-VPD) Surveillance Network to support vaccine introduction decisions and use. The network was established to strengthen surveillance and laboratory confirmation of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis.Methods. Sentinel hospitals report cases of children <5 years of age hospitalized for suspected meningitis. Laboratories report confirmatory testing results and strain characterization tested by polymerase chain reaction. In 2019, the network included 123 laboratories that follow validated, standardized testing and reporting strategies.Results. From 2014 through 2019, >137 000 suspected meningitis cases were reported by 58 participating countries, with 44.6% (n = 61 386) reported from countries in the WHO African Region. More than half (56.6%, n = 77 873) were among children <1 year of age, and 4.0% (n = 4010) died among those with reported disease outcome. Among suspected meningitis cases, 8.6% (n = 11 798) were classified as probable bacterial meningitis. One of 3 bacterial pathogens was identified in 30.3% (n = 3576) of these cases, namely S. pneumoniae (n = 2177 [60.9%]), H. influenzae (n = 633 [17.7%]), and N. meningitidis (n = 766 [21.4%]). Among confirmed bacterial meningitis cases with outcome reported, 11.0% died; case fatality ratio varied by pathogen (S. pneumoniae, 12.2%; H. influenzae, 6.1%; N. meningitidis, 11.0%). Among the 277 children who died with confirmed bacterial meningitis, 189 (68.2%) had confirmed S. pneumoniae. The proportion of pneumococcal cases with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) serotypes decreased as the number of countries implementing PCV increased, from 77.8% (n = 273) to 47.5% (n = 248). Of 397 H. influenzae specimens serotyped, 49.1% (n = 195) were type b. Predominant N. meningitidis serogroups varied by region.Conclusions. This multitier, global surveillance network has supported countries in detecting and serotyping the 3 principal invasive bacterial pathogens that cause pediatric meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial pathogen detected globally despite the growing number of countries that have nationally introduced PCV. The large proportions of deaths due to S. pneumoniae reflect the high proportion of meningitis cases caused by this pathogen. This global network demonstrated a strong correlation between PCV introduction status and reduction in the proportion of pneumococcal meningitis infections caused by vaccine serotypes. Maintaining case-based, active surveillance with laboratory confirmation for prioritized vaccine-preventable diseases remains a critical component of the global agenda in public health.

TI  - How accurate is frozen section pathology compared to permanent pathology in detecting involved margins and lymph nodes in breast cancer?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Frozen section (FS) pathology has multiple limitations, and different institutions report variable experiences with the use of FS for diagnosis of tumor involvement. We aimed to compare the FS accuracy with that of permanent pathology (gold standard) regarding marginal involvement and lymph node status using data from the largest breast cancer registry in Iran. Methods In this retrospective study, women who had both FS and permanent pathology reports were included. The two pathology reports were cross compared with regard to the involvement of tumor margins and sentinel lymph nodes. Results Overall, 2786 patients entered the study. Mean age of patients was 48.96 +/- 11.44 years. A total of 1742 margins were analyzed. Accordingly, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FS pathology for detection of involvement of involved margins were 78.49%, 97.63%, 65.1%, and 98.7%, respectively. The accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for FS pathology were 96.61% and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.64-0.831), respectively. A total of 1702 sentinel lymph node biopsies were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV, of FS pathology for detection of lymph node involvement, were 87.1%, 98%, 95.5%, and 93.3%, respectively. Accuracy and AUC of FS for diagnosis of involved lymph nodes were 94.1% and 0.926 (95% CI: 0.909-0.942), respectively. Conclusion Frozen pathology is a suitable method for identifying involved sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer, but this method has a less than optimum efficacy for detecting and confirming marginal involvement.

TI  - Assessment of sal (<i>Shorea robusta</i>) forest phenology and its response to climatic variables in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based observation provides an opportunity to study the spatiotemporal variations of plant phenology across the landscapes. This study aims to examine the phenological variations of different types of sal (Shorea robusta) forests in India and also to explore the relationship between phenology metrics and climatic parameters. Sal, one of the main timber-producing species of India, can be categorized into dry, moist, and very moist sal. The phenological metrics of different types of sal forests were extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series data (2002-2015). During the study period, the average start of season (SOS) was found to be 16 May, 17 July, and 29 June for very moist, moist, and dry sal forests, respectively. The spatial distribution of mean SOS was mapped as well as the impact of climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) on SOS was investigated during the study period. In relation to the rainfall, values of the coefficient of determination (R-2) for very moist, moist, and dry sal forests were 0.69, 0.68, and 0.76, respectively. However, with temperature, R-2 values were found higher (R-2 = 0.97, 0.81, and 0.97 for very moist, moist, and dry sal, respectively). The present study concluded that MODIS EVI is well capable of capturing the phenological metrics of different types of sal forests across different biogeographic provinces of India. SOS and length of season (LOS) were found to be the key phenology metrics to distinguish the different types of sal forests in India and temperature has a greater influence on SOS than rainfall in sal forests of India.

TI  - Chlorophyll and Suspended Solids Estimation in Portuguese Reservoirs (Aguieira and Alqueva) from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs have been subject to anthropogenic stressors, becoming increasingly degraded. The evaluation of ecological potential in reservoirs is remarkably challenging, and consistent and regular monitoring using the traditional in situ methods defined in the WFD is often time- and money-consuming. Alternatively, remote sensing offers a low-cost, high frequency, and practical complement to these methods. This paper proposes a novel approach, using a C2RCC processor to analyze Sentinel-2 imagery data to retrieve information on water quality in two reservoirs of Portugal, Aguieira and Alqueva. We evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution of Chl a and total suspended solids (TSS), between 2018 and 2020, comparing in situ and satellite data. Generally, Alqueva reservoir allowed lower relative (NRMSE = 8.9% for Chl a and NRMSE = 21.9% for TSS) and systematic (NMBE = 1.7% for Chl a and NMBE = 2.0% for TSS) errors than Aguieira, where some fine-tuning would be required. Our paper shows how satellite data can be fundamental for water-quality assessment to support the effective and sustainable management of inland waters. In addition, it proposes solutions for future research in order to improve upon the methods used and solve the challenges faced in this study.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Modified Pathologic Nodal Classification System for Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Given the evolving patterns of lymph node evaluation for cutaneous melanoma, it is unclear whether the current nodal classification system will continue to accurately reflect prognosis in the modern era. Existing nodal staging for cutaneous melanoma was developed primarily for patients undergoing completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for node-positive disease and does not produce groups with continuously increasing mortality.OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a modified nodal classification system for cutaneous melanoma.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort analysis included 105 785 patients with cutaneous melanoma undergoing surgery and nodal evaluation from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2015, in the National Cancer Database. Extent of lymph node dissection was available for patients diagnosed in 2012 and onward. Multivariable models were generated with number of positive lymph nodes modeled using restricted cubic splines. A modified nodal classification system was derived using recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). The proposed lymph node classification system was validated in 85 499 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER-18) database. Data were analyzed from April 9, 2020, to May 28, 2021.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival.RESULTS Among the 105 785 patients included in the analysis (62 496 men [59.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.9 [15.5] years), number of positive lymph nodes (hazard ratio [HR] per lymph node for 0 to 2 positive lymph nodes, 2.48 [95% CI, 2.37-2-61; P<.001]; HR per lymph node for >3 positive lymph nodes, 1.10 [95% CI 1.07-1.13; P<.001]), clinically detected metastases (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.27-1.42; P<.001), and in-transit metastases (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.34-1.65; P<.001) were independently associated with mortality. An RPA-derived system using these variables demonstrated continuously increasing mortality for each proposed lymph node classification group, with HRs of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.76-1.91) for N1a, 2.72 (95% CI, 2.58-2.86) for N1b, 3.79 (95% CI, 3.51-4.08) for N2a, 4.56 (95% CI, 4.22-4.92) for N2b, 6.15 (95% CI, 5.59-6.76) for N3a, and 8.25 (95% CI, 7.64-8.91) for N3b in the proposed system (P<.001). By contrast, the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) nodal classification system produced a more haphazard mortality profile, with HRs of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.76-1.91) for N1a, 3.81 (95% CI, 3.53-4.12) for N1b, 2.59 (95% CI, 2.30-2.93) for N1c, 2.71 (95% CI, 2.56-2.87) for N2a, 4.51 (95% CI, 4.17-4.87) for N2b, 3.44 (95% CI, 2.60-4.55) for N2c, 6.06 (95% CI, 5.51-6.67) for N3a, 8.15 (95% CI, 7.54-8.81) for N3b, and 6.90 (95% CI, 5.60-8.49) for N3c. As a sensitivity analysis, the proposed system continued to accurately stratify patients when excluding those undergoing CLND for microscopic lymph node metastases. This system was validated for overall survival and cause-specific mortality in SEER-18. Last, a new overall staging system for node-positive patients was developed by RPA and demonstrated improved concordance vs the AJCC, 8th edition system (C statistic, 0.690 [95% CI, 0.689-0.691] vs 0.666 [95% CI, 0.666-0.668]).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study suggest that a modified nodal classification system can accurately stratify mortality risk in cutaneous melanoma in an era of increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy without CLND and should be considered for future staging systems.

TI  - An Investigation on Deep Learning Approaches to Combining Nighttime and Daytime Satellite Imagery for Poverty Prediction
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Poverty prediction is an important task for developing countries that lack the key measures of economic development. The prediction can help governments to allocate scarce resources for sustainable development. Nighttime satellite imagery offers an opportunity to address the task. However, as the nighttime satellite data contain a large amount of noise, directly leveraging it is not very effective. Previous studies have shown that relying on deep learning techniques nighttime satellite data can be a good proxy between daytime satellite imagery and the poverty index. In this letter, based on the proxy, we leverage four deep learning approaches, namely, VGG-Net, Inception-Net, ResNet, and DenseNet, to extract deep features from daytime satellite imagery and then apply least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression for poverty prediction. To further enhance the performance, we also integrate the squeeze and excitation (SE) module and focal loss into ResNet and DenseNet. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the investigated approaches, and the DenseNet with SE module and focal loss performs the best.

TI  - Assessing factors influencing communities' acceptability of mass drug administration for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Guyana
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Guyana is one of four countries in the Latin American Region where lymphatic filariasis (LF) remains endemic. In preparation for the introduction of a new triple drug therapy regimen (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole (IDA)) in 2019, an acceptability study was embedded within sentinel site mapping in four regions to assess mass drug administration (MDA) coverage and compliance, acceptability, and perceptions about treatment and disease. The results from this survey would inform the rollout of IDA in Guyana in 2019.Methods Data collection for the study occurred in August 2019, using a validated questionnaire administered by trained enumerators. Across all regions, a total of 1,248 participants were sampled by the Filarial Mapping team. Four-hundred and fifty-one participants aged over 18 years were randomly selected for participation in an expanded acceptability questionnaire. All data were captured in Secure Data Kit (SDK).Results Acceptability was measured using a mean acceptability score. Unadjusted mean scores ranged from 24.6 to 29.3, with 22.5 as the threshold of acceptability. Regional variation occurred across many indicators of interest: self-rated understanding about LF, mechanisms of LF transmission, LF drug safety and history of treatment during MDA. Region IV (Georgetown) recorded higher knowledge about LF, but lower compliance and acceptability. Number of pills was not perceived as a concern.Conclusion Acceptability of MDA was good across all four regions under study. Results from this study set a baseline level for key indicators and acceptability, from which the acceptability of IDA can be measured. Regional variations across indicators suggest that localized approaches should be considered for social mobilization and MDA delivery to capture these contextual differences.

TI  - Typhoon Warm-Core Structures Derived from FY-3D MWTS-2 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the three-dimensional (3D) warm-core structures of the Northwest Pacific typhoons Francisco, Lekima, and Krosa in August 2019 are retrieved from the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) microwave temperature sounder-2 (MWTS-2) observations of brightness temperature. Due to the lack of two window channels at 23.8 GHz and 31.4 GHz, an empirical cloud detection algorithm based on 50.3 GHz bias-corrected observations-minus-backgrounds is applied to obtain clear-sky observations for the multiple linear regression retrieval algorithm. The MWTS-2 cloud-affected channels 3-5 are not used to retrieve temperatures under cloudy conditions to eliminate low-tropospheric cold anomalies. The multiple linear regression coefficients are obtained based on MWTS-2 brightness temperatures and the temperatures from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-5 (ERA5) in the training period of three weeks before the month of targeted typhoons. The proposed MWTS-2 warm-core retrieval can well capture the radial and vertical temporal evolutions of the temperature anomalies of the typhoons Francisco, Lekima, and Krosa. The sizes of the warm-core anomalies of typhoons Lekima and Krosa retrieved by the MWTS-2 are horizontally and vertically similar to and stronger than those of the ERA5. Compared with the ERA5 reanalysis in August 2019, the biases for MWTS-2 temperature retrievals are smaller than +/- 0.25 K, with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) smaller than and 2.0 K at all altitudes. Additionally, the location of the 250-hPa maximum temperature anomaly retrieved by the MWTS-2 is closer to the best track than that of the ERA5. A weak warm-core around 200 hPa and a cold-core anomaly in the middle troposphere are also found in the outer rain bands region due to the effect of evaporation of rainfall.

TI  - The green indocyanine: the meaning of one tracer for the intra-peri operative imaging and vascular evaluation in the reconstructive surgery of head and neck: an experimental multidisciplinary study
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of a new diagnostic approach through the flow injection of green indocyanine such as the intraoperative and perioperative vascularization in the reconstruction of various anatomical areas with pedunculated or microsurgical free flaps, the identification of the sentinel lymph node in the latero cervical emptying or the assessment of the quality of anastomoses in organ transplantation. The study involved ten patients who underwent reconstructive procedures with different surgical approaches for reconstructive surgery of head and neck. An intraoperative check was performed in several stages to assess the real perfusion status of the treated area. Indocyanine green was used in all the patients in association with an intraoperative imaging diagnostic system. Indocyanine green showed in all the cases a full highlight of central and peripheral vascularization. Furthermore, this imaging system allowed a satisfactory and rapid intraoperative evaluation of the vascular tree and a high sensitivity in detection of the sentinel lymph node in latero cervical emptying. Despite the limited sample, the results suggest that the intraoperative administration of indocyanine green may represent a valid evaluating system for reconstructed flap perfusion and for sentinel lymph node identification in oncological surgery.

T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate correlation of single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) data on lymph flow (LF) from oral tongue cancer (OC) and the topography of lymph nodes (LN) metastases; to determine the clinical value of lymph flow guided radiotherapy (LFGRT).Materials and Methods: SPECT-CT visualization of LF from the OC lesions was performed after peritumoral injection of Tc-99m-phytate in 26 primary patients with clinical stage cT1-2N0M0 disease. We determined the individual drainage (unilateral/bilateral) from the tumor, and localization of sentinel LNs according to the neck levels. Metastases in LNs were verified with histology and a 2-year follow-up.Results: SPECT-CT detected bilateral LF in 10 (38.5%) of 26 patients; in 16 (61.5%) cases the drainage was unilateral. Histology revealed LNs metastases in three cases; regional recurrences were diagnosed in other four patients. In all seven observations metastases were located at the same site and level as the sentinel LNs. In eight (30.8%) of 26 patients sentinel LNs were visualized unilaterally at levels Ib-IIa; in five cases, unilaterally at levels I-IIa-III. In these patients, LFGRT demonstrated 59%- 70% reduction of irradiated volume, and 26%-42% and 51%-70% decrease of the mean dose to the spinal cord and the contralateral parotid gland. In patients with a bilateral drainage the reduction of doses absorbed by the spinal cord and contralateral parotid gland was 19% and 6%, respectively.Conclusion: Localization of sentinel LNs determined by SPECT-CT corresponds to the localization of metastatic LNs in terms of side and levels.

TI  - Assessment and Prediction of Land Use/Land Cover Change in the National Capital of Burundi Using Multi-temporary Landsat Data and Cellular Automata-Markov Chain Model
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Gitega District has experienced significant land use and land cover changes due to human activity. This has increased land degradation and environmental issues. However, there is no data on LULC change to guide land-use planning. This study assessed the rate and magnitude of LULC change over the last 35 years and also simulated future scenarios using Geoinformatics. In the first step, five LULC classes were extracted from satellite images from 1984, 2002, and 2019 using the supervised classification method. Overall accuracy and Kappa statistics of more than 85% and 82% respectively were achieved with 30 reference samples. Change analysis highlighted by Land Change Modeler (1984-2019) indicated a significant increase in Agriculture of 94 km(2), a slight increase in Shrub Land and Built-up Area of 5.5 km(2) and 2 km(2), respectively; and a steep decrease in Trees Cover and Grass Land of 62.5 km(2) and 39 km(2), respectively. Markov Chain and CA-Markov models were further calibrated to simulate LULC changes in 2038 and 2057 using the 2019 base map. Evaluation and analysis of 2019-2057 simulation results showed a moderate agreement of 75% for Kappa and the same trends of LULC change: Trees Cover, Grass Land, and Shrub Land will decrease by 11.5 km(2), 13 km(2), 11.5 km(2) respectively, whereas Agriculture and Built-up Area will increase by 30 km(2) and 6 km(2) respectively in 2057. These study outcomes can support decision-making towards restoration measures of land degradation and long-term environmental conservation in the region.

TI  - SOIL EROSION SUSCEPTIBILITY MAPPING OF IMO RIVER BASIN USING MODIFIED GEOMORPHOMETRIC PRIORITISATION METHOD
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gullies and other forms of erosion have been the greatest environmental problem and catastrophe in most high- and low-income countries. The challenge posed by soil erosion has compromised agricultural productivity, environmental biodiversity and food safety for the world's population. It is important to identify vulnerable areas to soil erosion in each region to initiate remedial measures. This study demonstrates the use of watershed morphometry coupled with weighted sum analysis (WSA) to estimate the soil erosion susceptibility of the Imo River Basin sub-watersheds (SWs) in South-Eastern Nigeria using satellite remote-sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) analysis. To this end, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 30 m spatial resolution was used to extract and analyse 18 morphometric parameters including basic, linear, shape and relief. The method of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves was used to validate the model's prediction accuracy. This morphometry-based analysis resulted in the SWs being classified into zones of low, medium, high and very high erosion susceptibility. With regard to erosion susceptibility, 41.51% of the basin (2494.68 km(2)) is in the very high priority zone; while 10.50%, 44.33% and 3.66% of the basin are in the high, medium and low priority zones respectively. Validation of the final erosion susceptibility map showed a prediction accuracy of 81%. The use of satellite imagery and morphometric analysis in this study was cost- and time-effective for identifying areas susceptible to soil erosion.

TI  - An Investigation into Ground Movement on the Ventnor Landslide Complex, UK Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of ground movement rates along the coastline and upper sections of the Ventnor landslide complex was carried out utilizing Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar methods using Sentinel-1 SAR data from 2015 to 2019 (four years). Results were compared with rainfall data, historical ground investigation records and monitoring surveys carried out at Ventnor to relate observations to geology, geomorphology and rainfall. Decomposition of InSAR viewing geometries to vertical and horizontal aligned well with previous ground-based studies. Subsidence of -9.8 mm a(-1) at the Lowtherville Graben and heave of +8.5 mm a(-1) along the coastline south of Ventnor Park were observed. Decomposition to east-west geometry results showed an eastward displacement of approximately 12.4 mm a(-1) along the coastline south of Ventnor Park, and a westward displacement of -3.7 mm a(-1) throughout built up sections of Ventnor town, indicating the landslide was displacing more in an eastern direction than vertically. The cause of this movement was investigated by using publicly available intrusive boreholes paired with Persistent Scatterer Interferometry, and a new ground model spanning east-west parallel to the coastline was presented. No evidence of significant ground movement was observed along heavily protected sections of the coastline, suggesting coastal defences comprised of concrete aprons and rip rap appear to be an effective coastal management/landslide stabilisation tool when compared to rip rap alone. The mechanism of this increased stability is likely due to the combination of toe weighting and reduced toe erosion. A lag of approximately 13-20 days was observed between high rainfall events and subsequent peaks in ground displacement, which was shorter than a 29 day lag observed in a previous study. Similar observations of prolonged rainfall resulting in prolonged displacements were also observed. The study demonstrates the capabilities of the PSI methodology in identifying the same ground movements that conventional methods provide. By providing detailed analysis of ground deformation of the Ventnor landslide, we demonstrate small ground movements, validated with existing ground movement surveys. Similar methodology can be applied to coastal landslides in urban environments worldwide, providing a relatively cheap and rapid resource for coastal landslide monitoring.

TI  - Spatio-temporal land cover dynamics and emerging landscape patterns in western part of Lagos State, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagos State, which is home to Lagos metropolis and the eighteenth largest urban agglomeration in 2018 in the world, has been characterized by rapid urbanization. An earlier study of the eastern segment of the state revealed dramatic urban growth in previously rural local councils where it replaced mostly ecological assets. For a statewide view of the landscape pattern changes, this study examined the western segment of the state to characterize the magnitude and trend of these changes. This was done with Landsat images for 1984, 2006 and 2015 along with ENVI 5.0 software and FRAGSTATS v.4.2 spatial pattern analysis program. Results show that cumulatively, the ecological assets, which comprised 75% of the area in 1984, have been whittled down to about 34% by 2015 having been lost through urban development. At the council level in 2015, the highest growth areas, in decreasing order of magnitude, were Alimosho, Badagry, Ojo and Amuwo Odofin local government areas. Both class and landscape-level metrics confirmed the dominance and fragmentation of the resultant landscape in 2015 by urban development. In 1984, vegetation dominated the landscape at 55% coverage and was the largest feature with the highest area-weighted contiguity or connectedness index. Thirty-one years later in 2015, built-up areas were the dominant patch with 54% coverage and the highest contiguity and area-weighted contiguity index, higher than vegetation. These findings have narrowed the information gap about the spatial and temporal changes in the ecological assets of the western segment of Lagos State as a result of rapid urban expansion.

TI  - Social Stressors, Arboviral Infection, and Immune Dysregulation in the Coastal Lowland Region of Ecuador: A Mixed Methods Approach in Ecological Perspective
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits arboviral diseases such as dengue (DENY), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika viruses (ZIKV), is present in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Individuals at risk of mosquito-borne disease (MBD) in the urban tropics face daily challenges linked to their socio-environment conditions, such as poor infrastructure, poverty, crowding, and limited access to adequate healthcare. These daily demands induce chronic stress events and dysregulated immune responses. We sought to investigate the role of socio-ecologic risk factors in distress symptoms and their impact on biological responses to MBD in Machala, Ecuador. Between 2017 and 2019, individuals (>= 18 years) with suspected arbovirus illness (DENY, ZIKV, and CHIKV) from sentinel clinics were enrolled (index cases, N - 28). Cluster investigations of the index case households and people from four houses within a 200-m radius of index home (associate cases, N = 144) were conducted (total N = 172). Hair samples were collected to measure hair cortisol concentration (HCC) as a stress biomarker. Blood samples were collected to measure serum cytokines concentrations of IL-10, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta. Univariate analyses were used to determine the association of socio-health metrics related to perceived stress scores (PSS), HCC, and immune responses. We found that housing conditions influence PSS and HCC levels in individuals at risk of MBD. Inflammatory cytokine distribution was associated with the restorative phase of immune responses in individuals with low-moderate HCC. These data suggest that cortisol may dampen pro-inflammatory responses and influence activation of the restorative phase of immune responses to arboviral infections.

TI  - Biomimetic Leadership for 21st Century Companies
T2  - BIOMIMETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomimicry is a scientific discipline that aims to model the behavior or properties of biological systems so as to adapt them to other scientific areas. Recently, this approach has been adopted in order to develop an organizational model called "Organizational Biomimicry". It proposes a systemic approach, a worldview that places the organization and the people related to it as an integral part of nature, and an R&D system based on continuous learning from nature. The effective management of this business model depends on leaders who can make dynamic decisions, generate commitment to the views of the company, define specific goals, actively learn on multiple levels and tackle conflicts. This type of leadership may actually be being exercised in business practice; however, no leadership style inspired by biomimicry has been theorized to date. Thus, the aim of this research was to present a biomimetic leadership model that considers nature as a model, measure and mentor. To this end, we proposed, firstly, a definition of a biomimetic leader from the point of view of the characteristics of biomimetic organizations. Then, we determined the characteristics of this leadership type. Secondly, we conducted a review of the main leadership styles analyzed in the recent literature about management; then, for each leadership type, we extracted the characteristics that will adapt to the biomimetic leadership model. From this process, we obtained the traits of a biomimetic leader. This characterization (definition plus characteristics) was subjected to an expert panel, which determined its validity.

TI  - Kritiese ekologiese kuns en Hegel se raaiselagtige uitspraak dat kuns moet sterf Critical ecological art and Hegel's cryptic statement that art must die
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical ecological art and Hegel's cryptic statement that art must die Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831), one of the major figures in the history of philosophy, played a significant role in the development of German idealism from Immanuel Kant in the 18th century via figures such as Schelling and Fichte, with the movement culminating in Hegel's "absolute idealism". In ontological terms idealism means that "the idea" is regarded as the true reality, instead of material things. Karl Marx, who learned a lot from Hegel as far as his dialectical method goes, famously remarked that Hegel had turned the world on its head, and he, Marx (a materialist thinker), would put it back on its feet again.

TI  - Satellite Observation of Spatio-temporal Variations in Nitrogen Dioxide over West Africa and Implications for Regional Air Quality.
T2  - Journal of health & pollution
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is known to affect human health, causing heart and cardiovascular diseases, and it has been shown that locations with long term NO2 pollution recorded a high number of fatalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no ground stations monitoring emissions of NO2 over West Africa. The present study aimed to use satellite observations to examine pollutant trends over this region.OBJECTIVE: To examine the trend of NO2 over the entire West Africa sub region in relationship to contributions to environmental emissions using satellite-derived data. This enables the assessment of West Africa regional air pollution hot spots in relationship to enhancing atmospheric factors. The results from this study will also be useful guidance for setting air quality standards for air pollution controls to minimize health hazards.METHODS: The present study examined thirteen years of average monthly values of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to determine the spatio-temporal variation of this pollutant over West Africa. Satellite data for NO2 between 2005 and 2017 were used to determine the variation in pollution levels over West Africa. Correlations between NO2 and meteorological variables (wind speed, rainfall and air temperature) were obtained to explain the influence of West African weather on the region's pollution accumulation.RESULTS: The present study observed that NO2 concentrations varied from place to place and from season to season. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations during the dry season were higher (sometimes 200% higher) than values observed in the wet season which ranged between 0.5 and 6*1015 molec/cm2. Nitrogen dioxide north-south oscillation during the course of a year is largely controlled by the inter-tropical discontinuity (ITD) zone as high concentrations of NO2 are found in the vicinity of the ITD where wind speeds and horizontal vorticity approaches zero. Correlation analysis between NO2 and some atmospheric variables indicated NO2 concentrations are well influenced by atmospheric variables showing bipolar signals depending on the season. An increasing trend of NO2 was also found over selected cities of the region. This indicated that regional air quality is gradually deteriorating.CONCLUSIONS: The implications of worsening regional air quality were examined in the light of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. The dominant atmospheric factor determining pollution episodes in the region is the inter-tropical discontinuity line which marks the meeting point between the two wind regimes over the region. Densely populated areas are characteristically prone to elevated pollution and have experienced high fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic.COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors declare no competing financial interests.

TI  - Synergy of Landsat, climate and LiDAR data for aboveground biomass mapping in medium-stature tropical forests of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Tropical forests represent complex and dynamic ecosystems that cover extensive areas, hence the importance of determining biomass content and representing spatial variability. Objective: Estimating and mapping aboveground biomass and its associated uncertainty for medium -stature semi-evergreen (SMSP) and semi-deciduous (SMSC) tropical forests of the Yucatan Peninsula. Materials and methods: Aboveground biomass was estimated as a function of explanatory variables taken from Landsat images and climatic variables, using the random Forest algorithm. Aboveground biomass was mapped from previous biomass estimates for stripes of the territory with the presence of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and field data. Uncertainty at the pixel level was estimated as the coefficient of variation. Results and discussion: A combination of climatic and spectral variables showed acceptable capacity to estimate biomass in the medium-stature semi-evergreen and semi-deciduous tropical forest with an explained variance of 50 % and RMSE (root mean squared error) of 34.2 Mgmiddotha-1 and 26.2 Mgmiddotha-1, respectively, prevailing climate variables. SMSP biomass ranged from 4.0 to 185.7 Mgmiddotha-1 and SMSC ranged from 11.7 to 117 Mgmiddotha-1. The lowest values of uncertainty were recorded for the medium-stature semi-evergreen tropical forest, being higher in areas with lower amounts of aboveground biomass. Conclusion: Aboveground biomass was estimated and mapped by the combined use of auxiliary variables with an acceptable accuracy, against uncertainty of predictions, which represents an opportunity for future improvement.

TI  - Evaluating the Spectral Response and Yield of Soybean Following Exposure to Sublethal Rates of 2,4-D and Dicamba at Vegetative and Reproductive Growth Stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The commercialization of synthetic auxin-resistant crops and the commensurate increase in post-emergent auxin-mimic herbicide applications has resulted in millions of hectares of injury to sensitive soybeans in the United States since 2016. Visual yield loss estimations following auxin injury can be difficult. The goal of this research was to determine if spectral variations following auxin injury to soybean allow for more precise yield loss estimations. Identical field experiments were performed in 2018, 2019, and 2020 in Columbia, Missouri to compare the ability of established vegetative indices to differentiate between exposure levels of 2,4-D and dicamba in soybean and predict yield loss. Soybeans were planted at three timings for growth stage separation and were exposed to sublethal rates of 2,4-D and dicamba at the R2, R1, and V3 growth stages. A UAV-mounted multispectral sensor was flown over the trial 14 days after the herbicide treatments. The results of this research found that vegetative indices incorporating the red-edge wavelength were more consistent in estimating yield loss than indices comprised of only visible or NIR wavelengths. Yield loss estimations became difficult when soybean injury occurred during later reproductive stages when soybean biomass was increased. This research also determined that when injury occurs to soybean in vegetative growth stages late in the growing season there is a greater likelihood for yield loss to occur due to decreased time for recovery. The results of this research could provide direction for more objective and accurate evaluations of yield loss following synthetic auxin injury than what is currently available.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Sensitivity to Soil Moisture at High Incidence Angle and the Impact on Retrieval Over Seasonal Crops
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately, 30% of the Sentinel-1 (S-1) swath over land is imaged with incidence angles higher than 40 degrees. Still, the interplay among the scattering mechanisms taking place at such a high incidence and their implications on the backscatter information content is often disregarded. This article investigates, through an experimental and numerical study, the S-1 sensitivity to the surface soil moisture (SSM) over agricultural fields observed at low (similar to 33 degrees) and high (similar to 43 degrees) incidence angles and quantifies the impact of the incidence angle on the SSM retrieval accuracy. The study sites are the Apulian Tavoliere (Italy) and REd de MEDicion de la HUmedad del Suelo (REMEDHUS) (Spain), which are both instrumented with a hydrologic network continuously measuring SSM. At low incidence angles, results confirm that for crops such as wheat and barley, dominated in C-band by surface scattering, there exists a good sensitivity of S-1 VV to SSM. At high incidence angles, the sensitivity to SSM holds through the combination of the soil attenuated and double bounce scattering. Conversely, over crops dominated by volume scattering, such as sugar beet, the S-1 VV signal is not correlated with the in situ SSM observations, neither at low nor at high incidence. For all the crops, the sensitivity of S-1 to SSM in VH is found significantly lower than in VV. The impact of the incidence angle on the SSM retrieval has been studied with a recursive algorithm based on a short-term change detection approach. An upper and lower bounds for the worsening of the S-1 VV retrieval performance at far versus near range observations have been estimated. In the worst-case scenario, the root mean square error (RMSE) increases from similar to 0.056 m(3)/m(3), at low incidence, to similar to 0.071 m(3)/m(3), at high incidence. The mechanism that lowers the retrieval accuracy at high incidence angles is further investigated in the synthetic experiment and its impact on the RMSE is estimated in terms of the volume scattering contribution.

TI  - Advaita: Oneness as a Lived Reality-Examining Aspects of Profound and a Radical Psychology
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is all good to say, that the world is one! Are these idealistic/poetic ideas or could there be psychological pathways to experience oneness as a continuous realisation? This is not a question of philosophy or intellectual argumentation, but a question of living and being. There has been now interest in non-dual awareness in research as well (Josipovic, 2014). The objective of this article is to introduce a radical worldview-advaita vedanta that leads to profound cognitive, affective and behavioural implications of well-being beyond the surface level ideas of happiness. Advaita-which means 'not-two' is the most profound and radical of psychological theories Indic civilization has experienced and accepted as the epitome-the crown jewel. The Vedantic worldview and practice with the background throb of all Indic values-of inclusion, love and truth vests in Advaita-oneness. In popular imagination, it has been both esoteric-cised and yet has remained un-commodified. Contrary to popular ideas that look at advaita as a speculative philosophy, advaita is understood as a rich psychological theory with a basis in cognition, knowing, as well as a living in oneness. The students of modern psychology, especially, in India are left poorer, if they are unable to review advaita and yet study consciousness, which is a booming area of research in modern psychology. Advaita is a continuous living realisation-termed as Jivanmukti, the Vedantic ideal of being free, while living. Examining the primary Samskrit text-Jivanmukti-viveka, I describe Jivanmukti-of living in continuous realisation of oneness, till the body drops down, as stated by the great muni, whose above-mentioned abhyasa grantha-the application manual, is used across Hindu spiritual frameworks and monastic orders, till today.

TI  - A Deep Multitask Learning Framework Coupling Semantic Segmentation and Fully Convolutional LSTM Networks for Urban Change Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present a deep multitask learning framework able to couple semantic segmentation and change detection using fully convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In particular, we present a UNet-like architecture (L-UNet) that models the temporal relationship of spatial feature representations using integrated fully convolutional LSTM blocks on top of every encoding level. In this way, the network is able to capture the temporal relationship of spatial feature vectors in all encoding levels without the need to downsample or flatten them, forming an end-to-end trainable framework. Moreover, we further enrich the L-UNet architecture with an additional decoding branch that performs semantic segmentation on the available semantic categories that are presented in the different input dates, forming a multitask framework. Different loss quantities are also defined and combined together in a circular way to boost the overall performance. The developed methodology has been evaluated on three different data sets, i.e., the challenging bitemporal high-resolution Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA) Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) Sentinel-2 data set, the very high-resolution (VHR) multitemporal data set of the East Prefecture of Attica, Greece, and finally, the multitemporal VHR SpaceNet7 data set. Promising quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated that the synergy among the tasks can boost up the achieved performances. In particular, the proposed multitask framework contributed to a significant decrease in false-positive detections, with the F1 rate outperforming other state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.1% and 4.9% in the Attica VHR and SpaceNet7 data set cases, respectively. Our models and code can be found at https://github.com/mpapadomanolaki/multi-task-L-UNet.

TI  - Changes in respiratory virus infection trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea: the effectiveness of public health measures
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aims: Studies on the effectiveness of public health measures to prevent respiratory virus transmission in real-world settings are lacking. We investigated the effectiveness of universal mask use and adherence to other personal preventive measures on the changing viral respiratory infection patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Data were extracted from the South Korean National Respiratory Virus Sentinel Surveillance System. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a cross-sectional survey on adherence to personal preventive measures was conducted. Additionally, the number of subway passengers was analyzed to estimate physical distancing compliance. Results: During the pandemic, adherence to personal preventive measures significantly increased, particularly indoors and on public transportation. Respiratory virus trends were compared based on laboratory surveillance data of 47,675 patients with acute respiratory infections (2016 to 2020). The 2019 to 2020 influenza epidemic ended within 3 weeks, from the epidemic peak to the epidemic end, quickly ending the influenza season; with a 1.8-to 2.5-fold faster decline than in previous seasons. Previously, the overall respiratory virus positivity rate remained high after the influenza seasons had ended (47.7% to 69.9%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, this positive rate, 26.5%, was significantly lower than those in previous years. Hospital-based surveillance showed a decreased number of hospitalized patients with acute viral respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: This study suggests that high compliance to the use of personal preventive measures in public might reduce the incidence of all respiratory virus infections and its hospitalization rates, with no additional quarantine, isolation, or contact screening.

TI  - Regarding Some Pitfalls in Urban Heat Island Studies Using Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempts to illustrate the complexity of thermal infrared (TIR) data analysis for urban heat island studies. While a certain shift regarding the use of correct scientific nomenclature (using the term "surface urban heat island") could be observed, the literature is full of incorrect conclusions and results using erroneous terminology. This seems to be the result of the ease of such literature implicitly suggesting that "warm surfaces" result in "high air temperatures", ultimately drawing conclusions for urban planning authorities. It seems that the UHI is easy to measure, easy to explain, easy to find, and easy to illustrate-simply take a TIR-image. Due to this apparent simplicity, many authors seem to jump into UHI studies without fully understanding the nature of the phenomenon as far as time and spatial scales, physical processes, and the numerous methodological pitfalls inherent to UHI studies are concerned. This paper attempts to point out some of the many pitfalls in UHI studies, beginning with a proper correction of longwave emission data, the consideration of the source area of a thermal signal in an urban system-which is predominantly at the roof level-demonstrating the physics and interactions of radiation and heat fluxes, especially in relation to the importance of urban storage heat flux, and ending with an examination of examples from the Basel study area in Switzerland. Attention is then turned to the analysis of spatially distributed net radiation in the day- and at nighttime as a minimum requirement for urban heat island studies. The integration of nocturnal TIR images is notably recommended, as satellite data and the UHI-phenomenon cover the same time period.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Agronomic Data and UAV Imagery for Rice Yield Estimation
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a spatial analysis of agronomic and remote sensing data is carried out to derive accurate rice crop yield estimation. The variability of a series of vegetation indices (VIs) was calculated from remote sensing data obtained via a commercial UAS platform (e-Bee) at four dates (per stage of development), and the development of estimation models was conducted. The study area is located in the region of Chalastra (municipality of Thessaloniki, North Greece) and the primary data were obtained during the 2016 growing season. These data include ultra-high resolution remote sensing multispectral images of 18 plots totaling 58 hectares of Ronaldo and Gladio rice crop varieties, 97 sample point data related to yield, and many other pieces of information recorded in the producer's field log. Ten simple and compound VIs were calculated, and the evolution of their values during the growing season as well as their comparative correlation were studied. A study of the usability of each VI was conducted for the different phenological stages of the cultivation and the variance of VIs and yield; the more correlated VIs were identified. Furthermore, three types of multitemporal VI were calculated from combinations of VIs from different dates, and their contribution to improving yield prediction was studied. As Ronaldo is a Japonica type of rice variety and Gladio is Indica type, they behave differently in terms of maturation time (Gladio is approximately 20 days earlier) and the value of every VI is affected by changes in plant physiology and phenology. These differences between the two varieties are reflected in the multitemporal study of the single-date VIs but also in the study of the values of the multitemporal VIs. In conclusion, Ronaldo's yield is strongly dependent on multitemporal NDVI (VI6th July + VI30 Aug, R-2 = 0.76), while Gladio's yield is strongly dependent on single-date NDVI (6 July, R-2 = 0.88). The compound VIs RERDVI and MCARI1 have the highest yield prediction (R-2 = 0.77) for Ronaldo (VI6th July + VI30 Aug) and Gladio (R-2 = 0.95) when calculated in the booting stage, respectively. For the Ronaldo variety, the examination of the multitemporal VIs increases yield prediction accuracy, while in the case of the Gladio variety the opposite is observed. The capabilities of multitemporal VIs in yield estimation by combining UAVs with more flights during the different growth stages can improve management and the cultivation practices.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Change Using Time-Series Data and Random Forest in North Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - North Korea being one of the most degraded forests globally has recently been emphasizing in forest restoration. Monitoring the trend of forest restoration in North Korea has important reference significance for regional environmental management and ecological security. Thus, this study constructed and analyzed a time-series land use land cover (LULC) map to identify the LULC changes (LULCCs) over extensive periods across North Korea and understand the forest change trends. The analysis of LULC used Landsat multi-temporal image and Random Forest algorithm on Google Earth Engine(GEE) from 2001 to 2018 in North Korea. Through the LULCC detection technique and consideration of the cropland change relation with elevation, the forest change in North Korea for 2001-2018 was evaluated. We extended the existing sampling methodology and obtained a higher overall accuracy (98.2% +/- 1.6%), with corresponding kappa coefficients (0.959 +/- 0.037), and improved the classification accuracy in cropland and forest cover. Through the change detection and spatial analysis, our research shows that the forests in the southern and central regions of North Korea are undergoing restoration. The sampling method we extended in this study can effectively and reliably monitoring the change trend of North Korea forests. It also provides an important reference for the regional environmental management and ecological security in North Korea.

TI  - Explanations for Wind Turbine Installations: Local and Global Environmental Concerns in the Central Corridor of the United States?
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Even where physical conditions appear perfectly suited for wind power production, there is significant variation in the number of turbines installed. This pattern suggests that physical conditions are a pre-requisite for, but not a determinant of, that production. This study reports the results of an analysis of the county-level correlates of wind power installations in the north-south corridor of the central United States, which contains much of the country's greatest land-based wind resources. This study focuses on the relative effects of social capital, global climate change concern, and local biodiversity, while controlling for other potential explanations that previous research has identified as leading to support for or to opposition to turbine installation. We find (1) that greater local biodiversity is associated with fewer turbine installations; (2) that the percent of the public who believe humans are causing climate change is not associated with the number of installed turbines; and (3) that a higher degree of county-level social capital is associated with fewer installations. These findings suggest the predominance of local considerations over global ones when it comes to the actual siting of turbines.

TI  - MaNGA galaxies with off-centered spots of enhanced gas velocity dispersion
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Off-centered spots of the enhanced gas velocity dispersion, sigma, are revealed in some galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey (MaNGA). Aiming to clarify the origin of the spots of enhanced sigma, we examine the distributions of the surface brightness, the line-of-sight velocity, the oxygen abundance, the gas velocity dispersion, and the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich spaxel classification in seven galaxies. We find that the enhanced sigma spots in six galaxies can be attributed to a (minor) interaction with a satellite. Three galaxies in our sample have a very close satellite (the separation in the sky plane is comparable to the optical radius of the galaxy). The spots of enhanced sigma in those galaxies are located at the edge of the galaxy close to the satellite. The spots of enhanced sigma in three other galaxies are related to bright spots in the photometric B band within the galaxy, which can be due to the projection of a satellite in the line of sight of the galaxy. The oxygen abundances in the spots in these three galaxies are reduced. This suggests that the low-metallicity gas from the satellite is mixed with the interstellar medium of the disk, that is, the gas exchange between the galaxy and its satellite takes place. The spectra of the spaxels within a spot are usually H II-region-like, suggesting that the interaction (gas infall) in those galaxies does not result in appreciable shocks. In contrast, the spot of the enhanced sigma in the galaxy M-8716-12703 is associated with an off-centered active galactic nucleus-like radiation distribution. One can suggest that the spot of the enhanced sigma in the M-8716-12703 galaxy is different in origin, or that the characteristics of gas infall in this case differs from that in other galaxies.

TI  - Can the Structure Similarity of Training Patches Affect the Sea Surface Temperature Deep Learning Super-Resolution?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meso- and fine-scale sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential parameter in oceanographic research. Remote sensing is an efficient way to acquire global SST. However, single infrared-based and microwave-based satellite-derived SST cannot obtain complete coverage and high-resolution SST simultaneously. Deep learning super-resolution (SR) techniques have exhibited the ability to enhance spatial resolution, offering the potential to reconstruct the details of SST fields. Current SR research focuses mainly on improving the structure of the SR model instead of training dataset selection. Different from generating the low-resolution images by downscaling the corresponding high-resolution images, the high- and low-resolution SST are derived from different sensors. Hence, the structure similarity of training patches may affect the SR model training and, consequently, the SST reconstruction. In this study, we first discuss the influence of training dataset selection on SST SR performance, showing that the training dataset determined by the structure similarity index (SSIM) of 0.6 can result in higher reconstruction accuracy and better image quality. In addition, in the practical stage, the spatial similarity between the low-resolution input and the objective high-resolution output is a key factor for SST SR. Moreover, the training dataset obtained from the actual AMSR2 and MODIS SST images is more suitable for SST SR because of the skin and sub-skin temperature difference. Finally, the SST reconstruction accuracies obtained from different SR models are relatively consistent, yet the differences in reconstructed image quality are rather significant.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Wetland Area Loss and Gain in the Western Barataria Basin (Louisiana, USA) since Hurricane Katrina
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to analyze the recent record of Landsat satellite imagery to better understand spatial patterns and infer processes of change in marshland vegetation cover in coastal Louisiana wetlands. The study area covered subbasins of the western Barataria Basin near the Bayou Lafourche in southeastern Louisiana. Bayou Lafourche's estuaries have seen some of the highest rates of wetland conversion to open water of any coastal zone in the United States. The Landsat Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used in this study to map changes in land/water fractions at a 30-m pixel resolution between October 2005 (post-Katrina) and October 2018. Validation boat surveys were conducted in July 2020 to visually verify the presence or absence of (>1 m) emergent vegetation growing on marshlands across several subbasins, with photographs collected at more than 150 target locations along the route. Based on NDWI change, a total of 42.3 km(2) was estimated to fall into the category of wetland loss since 2005. The leading subbasins for these recent wetland-to-water conversions made up most of the southwestern portion of the study area just north of Port Fourchon. The consistently low distance detected between the majority of wetland loss cells and locations of historical oil and gas wells implies that effects of well drilling and extraction have had a continuing negative impact on marshland degradation in the basin. Conversely, a total of 34 km(2) was estimated to fall into the category of recent wetland gain, with much of the new vegetation growth verified to have been restored within several shoreline protection and dredging projects. It was concluded that the positive contributions made by such shoreline enhancement and marshland nourishment projects in Lafourche Parish to offset wetland losses over the past 15 years should not be underestimated.

TI  - Mangrove recovery in the Nicobar archipelago after the 2004 tsunami and coastal subsidence
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological and economic importance of mangroves is highly recognized in Asia, especially after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The Nicobar archipelago that sustained greater damage due to the 2004 tsunami and subsidence provides a unique case to the tsunami-related mangrove literature. We analyzed the trends in mangrove vegetation recovery from two severely impacted sites (one each with and without remnant vegetation) in the Nicobar archipelago using vegetation data collected during two field seasons (2010-2011 and 2019) and long-term satellite remote sensing data (2004 - 2019). We found that the recovery rates in terms of stem density and vegetation cover were much higher in the site with remnant vegetation compared to the site without remnant vegetation. Especially, the vegetation recovery rates were higher in the landward mangrove zone compared to the seaward mangrove zone. The species composition especially in the landward zones has changed drastically during the study period. Rhizophora mucronata dominated the seaward zone of both the sites, while Lumitzera racemosa, L. littorea, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and Sonneratia alba dominated the landward zones. The geomorphology of study sites seems to play a critical role in the landward transgression process of mangroves. Long-term ecological monitoring in the study sites inclusive of mangrove fauna and soil processes can greatly enhance the knowledge on mangrove recovery following this unique natural disturbance. Moreover, such an approach can provide much-needed insights for the management and restoration of the ecologically and economically important mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Prediction of Solar Power Using Near-Real Time Satellite Data
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy production is affected by the attenuation of incoming irradiance from underlying clouds. Often, improvements in the short-term predictability of irradiance using satellite irradiance models can assist grid operators in managing intermittent solar-generated electricity. In this paper, we develop and test a satellite irradiance model with short-term prediction capabilities using cloud motion vectors. Near-real time visible images from Himawari-8 satellite are used to derive cloud motion vectors using optical flow estimation techniques. The cloud motion vectors are used for the advection of pixels at future time horizons for predictions of irradiance at the surface. Firstly, the pixels are converted to cloud index using the historical satellite data accounting for clear, cloudy and cloud shadow pixels. Secondly, the cloud index is mapped to the clear sky index using a historical fitting function from the respective sites. Thirdly, the predicated all-sky irradiance is derived by scaling the clear sky irradiance with a clear sky index. Finally, a power conversion model trained at each site converts irradiance to power. The prediction of solar power tested at four sites in Australia using a one-month benchmark period with 5 min ahead prediction showed that errors were less than 10% at almost 34-60% of predicted times, decreasing to 18-26% of times under live predictions, but it outperformed persistence by >50% of the days with errors <10% for all sites. Results show that increased latency in satellite images and errors resulting from the conversion of cloud index to irradiance and power can significantly affect the forecasts.

TI  - The Role of Earth Observation in Achieving Sustainable Agricultural Production in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions of the World
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Crop production is a major source of food and livelihood for many people in arid and semi-arid (ASA) regions across the world. However, due to irregular climatic events, ASA regions are affected commonly by frequent droughts that can impact food production. In addition, ASA regions in the Middle East and Africa are often characterised by political instability, which can increase population vulnerability to hunger and ill health. Remote sensing (RS) provides a platform to improve the spatial prediction of crop production and food availability, with the potential to positively impact populations. This paper, firstly, describes some of the important characteristics of agriculture in ASA regions that require monitoring to improve their management. Secondly, it demonstrates how freely available RS data can support decision-making through a cost-effective monitoring system that complements traditional approaches for collecting agricultural data. Thirdly, it illustrates the challenges of employing freely available RS data for mapping and monitoring crop area, crop status and forecasting crop yield in these regions. Finally, existing approaches used in these applications are evaluated, and the challenges associated with their use and possible future improvements are discussed. We demonstrate that agricultural activities can be monitored effectively and both crop area and crop yield can be predicted in advance using RS data. We also discuss the future challenges associated with maintaining food security in ASA regions and explore some recent advances in RS that can be used to monitor cropland and forecast crop production and yield.

TI  - High-Resolution Mining-Induced Geo-Hazard Mapping Using Random Forest: A Case Study of Liaojiaping Orefield, Central China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining-induced geo-hazard mapping (MGM) is a critical step for reducing and avoiding tremendous losses of human life, mine production, and property that are caused by ore mining. Due to the restriction of the survey techniques and data sources, high-resolution MGM remains a big challenge. To overcome this problem, in this research, such an MGM was conducted using detailed geological exploration and topographic survey data as well as Gaofen-1 satellite imagery as multi-source geoscience datasets and machine learning technique taking Liaojiaping Orefield, Central China as an example. First, using Gaofen-1 panchromatic and multispectral (PMS) sensor data and Random Forest (RF) non-parametric ensemble classifier, a seven-class land cover map was generated for the study area with an overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) of 99.69% and 98.37%, respectively. Next, several environmental drivers including land cover, topography (aspect and slope), lithology, distance from fault, elevation difference between surface and underground excavation, and the difference of spectral information from PMS multispectral data of different years were integrated as predictors to construct an RF-based MGM model. The constructed model showed an excellent prediction performance, with an OA of 98.53%, KC of 97.06%, and AUC of 0.998, and the 85.60% of the observed geo-disaster that have occurred in the predicted high susceptibility class (encompassing 2.82% of the study area). The results suggested that the changes in environmental factors in the high susceptibility areas can be used as indicators for monitoring and early-warning of the geo-disaster occurrence.

TI  - River Runoff Modelling and Hydrological Drought Assessment Based on High-Resolution Brightness Temperatures in Mainland China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of global climate change, drought is causing devastating impacts on the balance of the regional water resources system. Hydrological drought assessment is critical for drought prevention and water resources management. However, in China to assess hydrological drought at national scale is still challenging basically because of the difficulty of obtaining runoff data. In this study, we used the state-of-the-art passive microwave remote sensing techniques in river runoff modelling and thus assessed hydrological drought in Mainland China in 1996-2016. Specifically, 79 typical hydrological stations in 9 major basins were selected to simulate river runoff using the M/C signal method based on a high-resolution passive microwave bright temperature dataset. The standardized runoff index (SRI) was calculated for the spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological drought. Results show that passive microwave remote sensing can provide an effective way for runoff modelling as 92.4% and 59.5% of the selected 79 stations had the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) scores greater than 0.5. Especially in areas located on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the Inland and the Southwest River Basin, the performance of the M/C signal method is quite outstanding. Further analysis indicates that stations with small rivers in the plateau areas with sparse vegetation tend to have better simulated results, which are usually located in drought-prone regions. Hydrological drought assessment shows that 30 out of the 79 stations present significant increasing trends in SRI-3 and 18 indicate significant decreasing trends. The duration and severity of droughts in the non-permanent dry areas of the Hai River Basin, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin and the Southwest of China were found out to be more frequent and severe than other regions. This work can provide guidance for extending the applications of remote sensing data in drought assessment and other hydrological research.

TI  - Global fuel moisture content mapping from MODIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) of live vegetation is a crucial wildfire risk and spread rate driver. This study presents the first daily FMC product at a global scale and 500 m pixel resolution from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and radiative transfer models (RTMs) inversion techniques. Firstly, multisource information parameterized the PROSPECT-5 (leaf level), 4SAIL (grass and shrub canopy level) and GeoSail (tree canopy level) RTMs to generate three look-up tables (LUTs). Each LUT contained the most realistic model inputs range and combination, and the corresponding simulated spectra. Secondly, for each date and location of interest, a global landcover map classified fuels into three classes: grassland, shrubland and forest. For each fuel class, the best LUT-based inversion strategy based on spectral information, cost function, percentage of solutions, and central tendency determined the optimal model for the global FMC product. Finally, 3,034 FMC measurements from 120 worldwide sites validated the statistically significant results (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 34.57%, p < 0.01). Filtering out low quality field measurements achieved better accuracy (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 32.36%, p < 0.01, n = 2008). It is anticipated that this global FMC product can assist in wildfire danger modeling, early prediction, suppression and response, as well as improve awareness of wildfire risk to life and property.

TI  - Decline in Vaccine-Type <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> Serotypes Following Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Introduction in Madagascar
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The 10-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced into the Extended Program on Immunization in Madagascar. We assessed the impact of PCV10 on the targeted pneumococcal serotypes among children < 5 years of age at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Mere Enfant Tsaralalana.Method Between 2012 and December 2018, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and tested for S. pneumoniae by culture, and antigen tests. The Sentinel Site Laboratory (SSL) referred available CSF samples to the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) for real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmatory testing and serotyping.Results In total, 3616 CSF specimens were collected. The SSL referred 2716 to the RRL; 125 were positive for S. pneumoniae. At the RRL, 115 samples that tested positive for S. pneumoniae were serotyped; PCV10 serotypes accounted for 20%. Compared to the pre-PCV period, the proportion of S. pneumoniae detected declined from 22% to 6.6%, (P < .05), the proportion of PCV10 serotypes as the cause of pneumococcal meningitis cases declined by 26% following vaccine introduction.Conclusions In our findings, PCV10 introduction resulted in a decline of meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae and PCV10 vaccine serotypes.

TI  - Ecological correlates of fecal corticosterone metabolites in female Greater Sage-Grouse (<i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurement of physiological responses can reveal effects of ecological conditions on an animal and correlate with demographic parameters. Ecological conditions for many animal species have deteriorated as a function of invasive plants and habitat fragmentation. Expansion of juniper (genus Juniperus L.) trees and invasion of annual grasses into sagebrush (genus Artemisia L.) ecosystems have contributed to habitat degradation for Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus (Bonaparte, 1827); hereinafter Sage-Grouse), a species of conservation concern throughout its range. We evaluated relationships between habitat use in a landscape modified by juniper expansion and annual grasses and corticosterone metabolite levels (stress responses) in feces (FCORTm) of female Sage-Grouse. We used remotely sensed data to estimate vegetation cover within the home ranges of hens and accounted for factors that influence FCORTm in other vertebrates, such as age and weather. We collected 35 fecal samples from 22 radio-collared hens during the 2017-2018 brood-rearing season (24 May-26 July) in southwestern Idaho (USA). Concentrations of corticosterone increased with home range size but decreased with reproductive effort and temperature. The importance of home range size suggests that maintaining or improving habitats that promote smaller home ranges would likely facilitate a lower stress response by hens, which should benefit Sage-Grouse survival and reproduction.

TI  - Estimating Regional Soil Moisture with Synergistic Use of AMSR2 and MODIS Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC), product of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), is not at an adequate level of accuracy on a regional scale. The aim of this study is to introduce a simple method to estimate SMC while synergistically using AMSR2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements with a higher accuracy on a regional scale. Two MODIS products, including daily reflectance (MYD021) and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) products were used. In 2015, 1442 in situ SMC measurements from six stations in Iran were used as ground-truth data. Twenty models were evaluated using combinations of polarization index (PI), index of soil wetness (ISW), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and LST. The model revealed the best results using a quadratic combination of PI and ISW, a linear form of LST, and a constant value. The overall correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, and mean absolute error were 0.59, 4.62%, and 3.01%, respectively.

TI  - Detection of Land Use Land Cover Changes Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques in a Secondary City in Bangladesh
T2  - Grassroots Journal of Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at classifying land use land cover (LULC) patterns and detect changes in a 'secondary city' (Savar Upazila) in Bangladesh for 30 years i.e., from 1990 to 2020. Two distinct sets of Landsat satellite imagery, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 1990 and Landsat 7 ETM+ 2020, were collected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. Using ArcMap 10.3, the maximum likelihood algorithm was used to perform a supervised classification methodology. The error matrix and Kappa Kat were done to measure the mapping accuracy. Both images were classified into six separate classes: Cropland, Barren land, Built-up area, Vegetation, Waterbody, and Wetlands. From 1990 to 2020, Cropland, Barren land, Waterbody, and Wetlands have been decreased by 30.63%, 11.26%, 23.54%, and 21.89%, respectively. At the same time, the Built-up area and Vegetation have been increased by 161.16% and 5.77%, respectively. The research revealed that unplanned urbanization had been practiced in the secondary city indicated by the decreases in Cropland, Barren land, Wetland, and Waterbody, which also showed direct threats to food security and freshwater scarcity. An increase in Vegetation (mostly homestead vegetation) indicates some environment awareness programs that encourage people to maintain homestead and artificial gardens. The study argues for the sustainable planning of a secondary city for a developing country's future development.

TI  - Where Was Odantapuri Located? Archaeological Evidence Using Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry
T2  - RESONANCE-JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical records reveal that Odantapuri Mahavihara was an important centre of Buddhist learning. It was established in the 8th century by Gopala (the first Pala Emperor), and for several centuries, it was part of a network of Mahaviharas in eastern India (the most famous being Nalanda, along with Vikramasila, Somapura and Jaggadala). Archaeologists have conclusively identified the locations of all these Mahaviharas except Odantapuri. The best guess (based on tenuous evidence) is that Odantapuri Mahavihara was located in the modern town of Bihar Sharif. There has been very little exploration at this site, and no investigation has revealed remains of an in situ structure comparable to a Pala Mahavihara. This article discusses a chance finding while analysing a region one kilometre north of Nalanda (about ten kilometres southwest of Bihar Sharif). Using stereoscopic remote sensing data from satellites, photogrammetry and geographical information systems (GIS) software, we identified a large (400 m x 450 m) structure buried below the village of Begampur, virtually at Nalanda's doorstep. Its shape is startlingly similar to both Vikramasila and Somapura (both built by Dharmapala, the successor and son of Gopala). Further, AMS dating of bricks from a portion of this site (another chance finding) suggests that they may be as old as Odantapuri Mahavihara. This new evidence allows us to update our best guess for Odantapuri Mahavihara's location, but a careful archaeological investigation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate spectral indices as tools for separation of active aquaponds filled with water and engaged in shrimp/fish production from empty aquaponds using Landsat-8 data in coastal region of Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh.Methodology: The active and empty aquaponds were demarcated with Landsat satellite (Landsat-8) Operational Land Imager's (OLI) multispectral images using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) algorithm and spectral indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Water Ratio Index (WRI) and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEInsh) by means of thresholds.Results: The supervised classification using maximum likelyhood classifier recorded the highest active aquapond area whereas; NDWI, combination of indices and WRI resulted in lower but almost similar extents. Evaluation of confusion matrix using validation points revealed that NDWI, WRI and combination of indices resulted in all most perfect agreement with a kappa value of more than 0.9. Maximum likelihood classifier, NDVI and MNDWI could separate active ponds and empty ponds from other land uses with strong agreement, while AWEInsh could separate different land uses only with moderate agreement.Interpretation: The study indicates that spectral indices like NDWI, WRI and combination of indices are able to delineate aquaponds that were cultured for shrimp/fish and kept empty at a given time with noticeably high accuracy using satellite data for better managing of resources in coastal ecosystem

TI  - Relations between marine biogeochemical indices and cloud properties over the Arabian Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of relations among ocean biogeochemical and cloud properties will help to plan experiments necessary to understand the mechanisms and processes underlying the links between ocean and atmosphere interactions. Here, we explored the associations between ocean biogeochemical and cloud properties in a region that seasonally experiences polluted and pristine atmospheric conditions in winter and summer, respectively. The implications of ocean surface chlorophyll-a and biogeochemical fluxes (sea salt, dimethyl sulphide and organic fraction in sea spray) to cloud properties (cloud effective radii (R-e), cloud optical thickness, and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC)) were studied using MODIS (Terra, Collection 6, L3) monthly data from 2001 to 2015 along with reanalysis information. We have adopted a climatological averaging approach in time (monthly, seasonal and annual) and space (coastal, open and total (basin) Arabian Sea). This approach was used to minimize incompatibility, if any, between ocean and cloud properties arising from spatio-temporal lags due to different dynamics in the respective boundary layers. The trends in monthly means suggest decreases in chlorophyll-a and CDNC, while R-e increased over the Arabian Sea basin during 2001-2015. Variability at the basin scale (expressed as standard deviation in each month, SD) exceeded mean values of respective months for chlorophyll-a, whereas it was nearly half of the mean values for CDNC. An increase in R-e seems facilitated more during warmer 2011-2015 than in the 2001-2010 period, which coincided with the decrease in CDNC. Fifteen-year monthly mean climatologies suggest considerable associations among ocean biogeochemical indices and cloud properties, which is more conspicuous during summer monsoon. Increase in sea salt flux appears to account for the higher values of R-e in June-July over the basin due to strong monsoon wind. Inverse relations between chlorophyll-a and R-e are indicative of smaller droplets that resulted from new particles formed from and/or facilitated by marine biogeochemical emissions. Decline in new particle production due to decrease in surface chlorophyll-a and the growth of particles facilitated by increase in warming, seem responsible for increase in R-e and decrease in CDNC from 2001 to 2015. Using chlorophyll-a as the main proxy for ocean biogeochemical indices, we demonstrated that connections between ocean biogeochemistry and clouds are sustained in both small and large scales in space and time over the Arabian Sea.

TI  - Using big data for evaluating development outcomes: A systematic map
T2  - CAMPBELL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Policy makers need access to reliable data to monitor and evaluate the progress of development outcomes and targets such as sustainable development outcomes (SDGs). However, significant data and evidence gaps remain. Lack of resources, limited capacity within governments and logistical difficulties in collecting data are some of the reasons for the data gaps. Big data-that is digitally generated, passively produced and automatically collected-offers a great potential for answering some of the data needs. Satellite and sensors, mobile phone call detail records, online transactions and search data, and social media are some of the examples of big data. Integrating big data with the traditional household surveys and administrative data can complement data availability, quality, granularity, accuracy and frequency, and help measure development outcomes temporally and spatially in a number of new ways. The study maps different sources of big data onto development outcomes (based on SDGs) to identify current evidence base, use and the gaps. The map provides a visual overview of existing and ongoing studies. This study also discusses the risks, biases and ethical challenges in using big data for measuring and evaluating development outcomes. The study is a valuable resource for evaluators, researchers, funders, policymakers and practitioners in their effort to contributing to evidence informed policy making and in achieving the SDGs.Objectives: Identify and appraise rigorous impact evaluations (IEs), systematic reviews and the studies that have innovatively used big data to measure any development outcomes with special reference to difficult contextsSearch Methods: A number of general and specialised data bases and reporsitories of organisations were searched using keywords related to big data by an information specialist.Selection Criteria: The studies were selected on basis of whether they used big data sources to measure or evaluate development outcomes.Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection was conducted using a data extraction tool and all extracted data was entered into excel and then analysed using Stata. The data analysis involved looking at trends and descriptive statistics only.Main Results: The search yielded over 17,000 records, which we then screened down to 437 studies which became the foundation of our systematic map. We found that overall, there is a sizable and rapidly growing number of measurement studies using big data but a much smaller number of IEs. We also see that the bulk of the big data sources are machine-generated (mostly satellites) represented in the light blue. We find that satellite data was used in over 70% of the measurement studies and in over 80% of the IEs.Authors' Conclusions: This map gives us a sense that there is a lot of work being done to develop appropriate measures using big data which could subsequently be used in IEs. Information on costs, ethics, transparency is lacking in the studies and more work is needed in this area to understand the efficacies related to the use of big data. There are a number of outcomes which are not being studied using big data, either due to the lack to applicability such as education or due to lack of awareness about the new methods and data sources. The map points to a number of gaps as well as opportunities where future researchers can conduct research.

TI  - APPLICATION OF INSAR TECHNIQUE FOR THE DETECTION OF GROUND DISPLACEMENT IN PENANG ISLAND, MALAYSIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope failure is Penang Island's most critical geohazards that inflict significant economic damage each year. Penang landslide is considered one of the most disastrous landslide regions in Malaysia. The threat to lives and property had been associated with the slope instability issues for decades and continuous rain that usually lasts for hours/days. Earlier research employed simulation and modeling to address this hazard, but InSAR technique has not been fully utilized to quantify Penang Island's movements. It now requires proper monitoring using satellite techniques. Sentinel-1A S-1A images acquired enables Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing technique looks very promising. The data were processed using a versatile and powerful tool called SARPROZ software. The Permanent Scatterer Interferometric SAR (PS-InSAR) technique was applied to monitor ground deformation in Penang Island, Malaysia, as various deformations have been reported for years. The results of S-1A data show slow ground deformation values ranging between -9.19 mm/yr and 10.00 mm/yr for subsidence pattern and from 5.00 mm/yr to 4.66 mm/yr for uplift behavior. The results with S-1A data confirmed a trend of deformations around the regions. This reflects the improvement of the S-1A datasets for the PS-InSAR analysis in the region. InSAR result was validated using available GPS analysis. The results were also related to some works on physical parameters such as rainfall, slope, geology, and soil properties of the region for comparison. However, the detailed spatial pattern of surface displacement in the middle of the island is not clear as persistent scatterer has a limitation in the vegetated and rural areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study represents the preliminary report of an Italian regional project aimed to monitor the status of young athletes in modern times and linking it to the monitoring started in the nineties.METHODS: After the preparatory stage, data were analyzed and discussed with coaches and researchers. Next, for the main stage, the coaches performed the tests and the supervisors reported them in a database. A total number of 173 participants (age: 10.64±2.42 years, BMI=18.43±3.49 kg/m2) were tested for standing long jump, sit and reach, 10*4 Shuttle Run, 3 kg-medical ball throw, and Sergeant Test. Nine sports disciplines were represented.RESULTS: 46.5% of the participants trained more than twice a week and 15.8% of the participants played more than 1 discipline. Girls were more flexible than boys, and differences emerged in the Sergeant and Shuttle Run Test, with boys outperforming girls in older ages.CONCLUSIONS: The "sentinel" role of sports societies, in terms of health and developmental risks, should represent valuable accountability. Authors advocate a specific focus shall be directed to the risks of youth sports specialization, gender-related developmental trajectories, long-life physical activity, and sport engagement.

AB  - Throughout the Great Plains, aboveground annual net primary productivity (ANPP) is a critical ecosystem service supporting billions of dollars of commerce and countless stakeholders. Managers and producers struggle with high interannual change in ANPP, which often varies 40% between years due to fluctuating precipitation and drought. To quantify ANPP trends and evaluate interannual and spatial variation, we created the Rangeland Production Monitoring Service (RPMS), a spatially explicit database with automatic annual updates of ANPP for all rangelands in the conterminous United States. The RPMS establishes relationships between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from remote sensing data and ANPP from soil ecological site descriptions. These relationships were applied to NDVI data in each year from 1984 to present, although the present assessment focuses on the period from 1984 to 2017. Validation metrics include an r(2) of 89% between predicted and observed ANPP at three locations in the Great Plains. For this special issue, we assess data from the RPMS to quantify trends and variation of ANPP in the Great Plains region for four major grassland types, smaller-scale ecological subsections, and national grassland units. Significant (alpha < 0.05) increases in ANPP since 1984 were observed across all major grassland types in the Great Plains, particularly the northern mixed-grass prairie, which also had the greatest interannual variation (21%) from 1984 to 2017. Corresponding significant increases (P < 0.1) in growing season precipitation were found in all grassland types except the shortgrass steppe. Spatial variation decreases from west to east and tallgrass prairie exhibited the lowest temporal and spatial variation of 8% and 21%, respectively, from 1984 to 2017. Grazing allotments in the National Grasslands exhibit differential recovery after drought ranging from about 15% to 350%. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Combining Landsat-8 spectral bands with ancillary variables for land cover classification in mountainous terrains of northern Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-8 spectral values have been used to map the earth's surface information for decades. However, forest types and other land-use/land-cover (LULC) in the mountain terrains exist on different altitudes and climatic conditions. Hence, spectral information alone cannot be sufficient to accurately classify the forest types and other LULC, especially in high mountain complex. In this study, the suitability of Landsat-8 spectral bands and ancillary variables to discriminate forest types, and other LULC, using random forest (RF) classification algorithm for the Hindu Kush mountain ranges of northern Pakistan, was discussed. After prior-examination (multicollinearity) of spectral bands and ancillary variables, three out of six spectral bands and five out of eight ancillary variables were selected with threshold correlation coefficients r(2)<0.7. The selected datasets were stepwise stacked together and six Input Datasets (ID) were created. The first ID-1 includes only the Surface Reflectance (SR) of spectral bands, and then in each ID, the extra one ancillary variable including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was added. We found an overall accuracy (OA) = 72.8% and kappa coefficient (KC) =61.9% for the classification of forest types, and other LULC classes by using the only SR bands of Landsat-8. The OA = 81.5% and KC=73.7% was improved by the addition of NDVI, NDWI, and NDSI to the spectral bands of Landsat-8. However, the addition of LST and DEM further increased the OA, and Kappa coefficient (KC) by 87.5% and 82.6%, respectively. This indicates that ancillary variables play an important role in the classification, especially in the mountain terrain, and should be adopted in addition to spectral bands. The output of the study will be useful for the protection and conservation, analysis, climate change research, and other mountains forest-related management information.

TI  - Validation of AVHRR Land Surface Temperature with MODIS and In Situ LST-A TIMELINE Thematic Processor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important parameter for tracing the impact of changing climatic conditions on our environment. Describing the interface between long- and shortwave radiation fluxes, as well as between turbulent heat fluxes and the ground heat flux, LST plays a crucial role in the global heat balance. Satellite-derived LST is an indispensable tool for monitoring these changes consistently over large areas and for long time periods. Data from the AVHRR (Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer) sensors have been available since the early 1980s. In the TIMELINE project, LST is derived for the entire operating period of AVHRR sensors over Europe at a 1 km spatial resolution. In this study, we present the validation results for the TIMELINE AVHRR daytime LST. The validation approach consists of an assessment of the temporal consistency of the AVHRR LST time series, an inter-comparison between AVHRR LST and in situ LST, and a comparison of the AVHRR LST product with concurrent MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST. The results indicate the successful derivation of stable LST time series from multi-decadal AVHRR data. The validation results were investigated regarding different LST, TCWV and VA, as well as land cover classes. The comparisons between the TIMELINE LST product and the reference datasets show seasonal and land cover-related patterns. The LST level was found to be the most determinative factor of the error. On average, an absolute deviation of the AVHRR LST by 1.83 K from in situ LST, as well as a difference of 2.34 K from the MODIS product, was observed.

TI  - Mapping forest disturbances across the Southwestern Amazon: tradeoffs between open-source, Landsat-based algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Local and cross-continental road building, increased economic teleconnections, growing agricultural demands, logging and mining practices, and general development processes are putting pressure on even the least densely populated regions of the Amazon, where local, regional, and global demand for food, fuel and fiber are resulting in observable biophysical effects. It is essential, then, that stakeholders can both map and understand the effects of these forest disturbances on ecosystem services. Multiple remote sensing algorithms focused on detecting vegetation changes have been developed: the challenge now lies in understanding which algorithm best suits the user ' s study area and research objective. Using Google Earth Engine, we compared the performance of three algorithms -Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED), Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr), and Multi-variate Time-series Disturbance Detection (MTDD)- to detect and characterize forest disturbances in the Southwestern Amazon (Ucayali, Peru and Acre, Brazil) during the 2000-2020 period. In general, the results of all of the algorithms agreed with the reference data: overall accuracies were 94% (+/- 0.6% LandTrendr), 95% (+/- 0.6% MTDD), and 96% (+/- 0.6% CODED). Although the map products exhibit similar spatial patterns, they often differ on the specific disturbance extent. CODED works well in capturing disturbances associated with roads, MTDD excels best at capturing entire disturbance patches, and LandTrendr excels both in terms of user friendliness and range of output options. Through three case study regions, we highlight land-cover change dynamics that have occurred in this remote, transboundary region over the last two decades. We also describe the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and demonstrate that it would be incorrect to assume that any one algorithm is the most accurate. Our work, then, improves the capacity of the community to understand how well each algorithm is suited best to map various forest disturbances to promote sustainable decision making.

TI  - Tropospheric Delay in the Neapolitan and Vesuvius Areas (Italy) by Means of a Dense GPS Array: A Contribution for Weather Forecasting and Climate Monitoring
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatiotemporal distribution and motion of water vapour (WV), the most variable greenhouse gas in the troposphere, is pivotal, not only for meteorology and climatology, but for geodesy, too. In fact, WV variability degrades, in an unpredictable way, almost all geodetic observation based on the propagation of electromagnetic signal through the atmosphere. We use data collected on a dense GPS network, designed for the purposes of monitoring the active Neapolitan (Italy) volcanoes, to retrieve the tropospheric delay parameters and precipitable water vapour (PWV). This study has two main targets: (a) the analysis of long datasets (11 years) to extract trends of climatological meaning for the region; (b) studying the main features of the time evolution of the PWV during heavy raining events to gain knowledge on the preparatory stages of highly impacting thunderstorms. For the latter target, both differential and precise point positioning (PPP) techniques are used, and the results are compared and critically discussed. An increasing trend, amounting to about 2 mm/decades, has been recognized in the PWV time series, which is in agreement with the results achieved in previous studies for the Mediterranean area. A clear topographic effect is detected for the Vesuvius volcano sector of the network and a linear relationship between PWV and altitude is quantitatively assessed. This signature must be taken into account in any modelling for the atmospheric correction of geodetic and remote-sensing data (e.g., InSAR). Characteristic temporal evolutions were recognized in the PWV in the targeted thunderstorms (which occurred in 2019 and 2020), i.e., a sharp increase a few hours before the main rain event, followed by a rapid decrease when the thunderstorm vanished. Accounting for such a peculiar trend in the PWV could be useful for setting up possible early warning systems for those areas prone to flash flooding, thus potentially providing a tool for disaster risk reduction.

TI  - Healing and Rebalancing in the Aftermath of Colonial Violence: An Indigenous-Informed, Response-Based Approach
T2  - GENEALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - What is understood as "healing" is often culturally and socially embedded. One's culture helps to define what it means to be well or unwell, and what it means to heal or recover. Sometimes, one's culture sits in contrast to the mainstream, western scientific approach to health, often seen as the freedom from illness. A Metis worldview is holistic in itself, and it incorporates notions and practices of well-being that go beyond just being "illness or problem free". Wellbeing is often directly linked to our relationship with the food that sustains us, to the various animal and plant worlds, to the elements, and to being in "right relationship" to the world and others. Dr. Catherine Richardson Kinewesquao presents an approach to healing which she refers to as transformative, energetic and spiritual. She draws from Cree teachings related to "mamatowisowin", the life force inherent in all beings and the act of calling forth this energy into the healing process. This life force is connected to dignity, justice and care. Metaphorically, it can be talked about as being released or made available when an individual opens to discussing/facing fears and sorrows, distressing events and losses, and to finding a way to integrate them into their whole being. It is a form of energy transmutation, of becoming more emotionally fluid and liberated from the negativity of what is "acting upon them". When energy is unblocked or released, particularly in the presence of a compassionate listener, the person may then have more energy for their chosen life projects. By using a response-based approach in the aftermath of violence and degradation, and by contextualizing events through exploratory conversations, one may transform stress into productive energy to fuel life, growth and action. Kinewesquao articulates the use of cultural processes for stress management and working with the natural world to enhance well-being. Ultimately, she makes a case that "positive social responses" (e.g., love, care, compassionate listening, support and cultural rituals) to one's suffering can be some of the best healing medicines.

TI  - Does 99mTc-tilmanocept, as next generation radiotracer, meet with the requirements for improved sentinel node imaging?
T2  - Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the migration of 99mTc-tilmanocept from the injection site (IS) as well as the uptake in sentinel nodes (SNs) and non-SNs for lymphatic mapping in patients with breast cancer and melanoma, scheduled for SN biopsy after interstitial tracer administration.MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 29 primary tumours in 28 patients (mean age: 62y, range: 45-81y) scheduled for SN biopsy planar images were acquired 10 and 120min after administration of 74MBq 99mTc-tilmanocept, in order to evaluate lymphatic drainage as well as uptake ratios between injection site (IS), SN and non-SN. SPECT-CT was performed immediately after delayed planar images to enable anatomical lymph node localization.RESULTS: SNs were visualized in all patients (100%) with drainage to 34 basins. Uptake in non-SNs was perceived in 16 basins (47%). Number of SNs was concordant between early and delayed images in all basins excepting five (86%). In 24 patients tracer migrated to one lymph node basin (LNB), in three to 2 and in one to 4. When IS was included (N=29) on image, IS/SN ratio could be measured per LNB. The IS/SN ratio at 2h compared to 15min decreased with an average of 66% (range: 15-96%). SN/non-SN 2h ratio in LNBs with visible non-SNs averaged 6.6 (range: 2.3-15.6). In 9 patients with two SNs SN1/SN2 ratio averaged 1.9 on delayed images. At histopathology, SNs were found to be tumour positive in 7 basins (20%).CONCLUSION: 99mTc-tilmanocept appears to meet the requirements for improved SN imaging in breast cancer and melanoma on the basis of early and persistent SN visualization frequently accompanied by no or markedly less non-SN uptake. This is associated to rapid migration from the injection site together with increasing SN uptake and retention as expressed by decreasing IS/SN and persistently high SN/non-SN ratios. Further head-to-head comparison of 99mTc-tilmanocept with standard SN radiotracers in larger series of patients is necessary.

TI  - Forest restoration and support for sustainable ecosystems in the Gandaki Basin, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring degraded forest is essential if we are to reduce human pressure on natural ecosystems and their biodiversity. Forests were nationalized in 1957 in Nepal and as a consequence, forest cover declined from 45% in 1964 to just 29% in 1994. However, as its response, sectoral plans and policies, particularly introduction of community-based forest management programs since the 1980s and conservation activities resulted in large scale forest cover restoration. Here, we examined the forest cover change in the Gandaki River Basin (GRB), the catchment with the largest altitudinal variation (ranging from +/- 93 to 8167 m) and environmental and ecological significance. To see how forests have changed since then, we analyzed snapshots of spatiotemporal, ecological and physiographic changes in forest cover, and forest type at decadal intervals from 1996 to 2016 using Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images. We observed an overall gain in forest cover of 207 km(2), from 7571 km(2) (34.4% of the total area) in 1996 to 7778 km(2) (35.3%) in 2016. Of the 21 forest cover types identified, the greatest forest coverage during 2016 was of Schima-Castanopsis forest (25.9%) and hill sal forests (16.4%). In terms of physiographic zones, land below 500 m (Tarai) where most people live, witnessed gradual declines in forest cover, in contrast to large increases in forests above 500 m. Historical examination of forest cover at ecological and physiographic scales helps to identify the elevation-wise distribution of forest resources, vegetation composition, ecosystem characteristics, anthropogenic pressure upon vegetation, and hence the overall influence of LULC upon the environment. These outputs will assist planners, policy makers, and researchers in their formulation of effective basin wide plans and policies to ensure the protection of basin level biodiversity and ecosystem function.

TI  - Towards High-Resolution Land-Cover Classification of Greenland: A Case Study Covering Kobbefjord, Disko and Zackenberg
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of the Arctic region is increasingly important in light of global warming as land cover maps can provide the foundation for upscaling of ecosystem properties and processes. To this end, satellite images provide an invaluable source of Earth observations to monitor land cover in areas that are otherwise difficult to access. With the continuous development of new satellites, it is important to optimize the existing maps for further monitoring of Arctic ecosystems. This study presents a scalable classification framework, producing novel 10 m resolution land cover maps for Kobbefjord, Disko, and Zackenberg in Greenland. Based on Sentinel-2, a digital elevation model, and Google Earth Engine (GEE), this framework classifies the areas into nine classes. A vegetation land cover classification for 2019 is achieved through a multi-temporal analysis based on 41 layers comprising phenology, spectral indices, and topographical features. Reference data (1164 field observations) were used to train a random forest classifier, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 91.8%. The red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data proved to be particularly well suited for mapping the fen vegetation class. The study presents land cover mapping in the three study areas with an unprecedented spatial resolution and can be extended via GEE for further ecological monitoring in Greenland.

TI  - Classification and Evaluation of Extended PICS (EPICS) on a Global Scale for Calibration and Stability Monitoring of Optical Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically stable areas across North Africa, known as pseudo invariant calibration sites (PICS), have been used as targets for the calibration and monitoring of optical satellite sensors. However, two major drawbacks exist for these sites: first is the dependency on a single location to be always invariant, and second is the limited amount of observation achieved using these sites. As a result, longer time periods are necessary to construct a dense dataset to assess the radiometric performance of on-orbit optical sensors and confirm that the change detected is sensor-specific rather than site-specific. This work presents a global land cover classification to obtain an extended pseudo invariant calibration site (EPICS) on a global scale using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. This technique provides multiple calibration sites across the globe, allowing for the building of richer datasets in a shorter time frame compared to the traditional approach (PICS), with the advantage of assessing the calibration and stability of the sensors faster, detecting possible changes sooner and correcting them accordingly. This work identified 23 World Reference System two (WRS-2) path/row locations around the globe as part of the global EPICS. These EPICS have the advantage of achieving multiple observations per day, with similar spectral characteristics compared to traditional PICS, while still producing a temporal coefficient of variation (ratio of temporal standard deviation and temporal mean) less than 4% for all bands, with some as low as 2.7%.

TI  - Delineating Functional Urban Areas Using a Multi-Step Analysis of Artificial Light-at-Night Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A functional urban area (FUA) is a geographic entity that consists of a densely inhabited city and a less densely populated commuting zone, both highly integrated through labor markets. The delineation of FUAs is important for comparative urban studies and it is commonly performed using census data and data on commuting flows. However, at the national scale, censuses and commuting surveys are performed at low frequency, and, on the global scale, consistent and comparable data are difficult to obtain overall. In this paper, we suggest and test a novel approach based on artificial light at night (ALAN) satellite data to delineate FUAs. As ALAN is emitted by illumination of thoroughfare roads, frequented by commuters, and by buildings surrounding roads, ALAN data can be used, as we hypothesize, for the identification of FUAs. However, as individual FUAs differ by their ALAN emissions, different ALAN thresholds are needed to delineate different FUAs, even those in the same country. To determine such differential thresholds, we use a multi-step approach. First, we analyze the ALAN flux distribution and determine the most frequent ALAN value observed in each FUA. Next, we adjust this value for the FUA's compactness, and run regressions, in which the estimated ALAN threshold is the dependent variable. In these models, we use several readily available, or easy-to-calculate, characteristics of FUA cores, such as latitude, proximity to the nearest major city, population density, and population density gradient, as predictors. At the next step, we use the estimated models to define optimal ALAN thresholds for individual FUAs, and then compare the boundaries of FUAs, estimated by modelling, with commuting-based delineations. To measure the degree of correspondence between the commuting-based and model-predicted FUAs' boundaries, we use the Jaccard index, which compares the size of the intersection with the size of the union of each pair of delineations. We apply the proposed approach to two European countries-France and Spain-which host 82 and 72 FUAs, respectively. As our analysis shows, ALAN thresholds, estimated by modelling, fit FUAs' commuting boundaries with an accuracy of up to 75-100%, being, on the average, higher for large and densely-populated FUAs, than for small, low-density ones. We validate the estimated models by applying them to another European country-Austria-which demonstrates the prediction accuracy of 47-57%, depending on the model type used.

TI  - Monitoring Large-Scale Restoration Interventions from Land Preparation to Biomass Growth in the Sahel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we demonstrate that restoration interventions in arid to semi-arid landscapes can be independently assessed by remote sensing methods throughout all phases. For early verification, we use Sentinel-1 radar imagery that is sensitive to changes in soil roughness and thus able to rapidly detect disturbances due to mechanised ploughing, including identification of the time of occurrence and the surface area prepared for planting. Subsequently, time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from high-resolution imagery enabled tracking and verifying of the increase in biomass and the long-term impact of restoration interventions. We assessed 111 plots within the Great Green Wall area in Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. For 58 plots, the interventions were successfully verified, corresponding to an area of more than 7000 ha of degraded land. Comparatively, these computerised data were matched with field data and high-resolution imagery, for which the NDVI was used as an indicator of subsequent biomass growth in the plots. The trends were polynomial and presented clear vegetation gains for the monthly aggregates over the last 2 years (2018-2020). The qualitative data on planted species also showed an increase in biodiversity as direct sown seeds of a minimum of 10 native Sahel species (six woody mixed with four fodder herbaceous species) were planted per hectare. This innovative and standardised monitoring method provides an objective and timely assessment of restoration interventions and will likely appeal more actors to confidently invest in restoration as a part of zero-net climate mitigation.

TI  - Evaluation Of Intraoperative Touch Imprint Cytology Of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Accuracy In Comparison To The Permanent Histology Diagnosis. A prospective study Of 25 Invasive Breast Cancers.
T2  - The Gulf journal of oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative evaluation of axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with breast carcinoma reduces the need of re-operations for axillary lymph node dissection. Various methods such as touch imprintcytology (TIC) and frozen section histology (FS) have been used to determine the SLN status intra-operatively. The sensitivity of intraoperative TIC examination on SLN is not consistent and varies in different studies. The aim of this study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of TIC, and its feasibility in clinical use.METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 24 female and 1 male patients with histologically proven breast carcinoma and an at most clinical stage of cT2N0, between March 2017 and 2020. Axillary lymph nodes were not detected/palpable on physical examination. The patient underwent breast-conserving surgery i.e. quadrantectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The intact lymph nodes were sent to histopathology laboratory for intraoperative TIC. The nodes were bisected, touch smears made and stained using the H&E and may Grunwald - Giemsa methods. The remaining tissue was processed in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded blocks and the slides were stained with H&E.RESULTS: In the three- year period (2017-2020), sentinel lymph node intraoperative touch imprint cytology was performed on 25 patients' lymph nodes with primary breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes in Muscat Private Hospital, Muscat, Oman. The average age of the patients was 54.69 year. SLN- TIC revealed 88.9% sensitivity, 93.75% specificity, 11.1% false negative rate and 6.25% false positive with an overall accuracy 92%.CONCLUSION: Touch imprint cytology has high sensitivity and specificity with an accepted accuracy. Intraoperative TIC is practical, time-efficient, and cost-effective procedure requiring minimal tissue preparation for SLN evaluation especially in clinical practice where FS is unavailable. Intraoperative touch imprint cytology can detect macrometastasis and micrometastasis to a lesser extent. Key words: breast carcinoma, sentinel node biopsy, intraoperative diagnosis, touch imprint cytology, micrometastasis.

TI  - Tourism Effect on the Spatiotemporal Pattern of Land Surface Temperature (LST): Babolsar and Fereydonkenar Cities (Cases Study in Iran)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of tourism on Land Surface Temperature (LST), an issue which has rarely been considered in the tourism development literature. In this research, remote sensing techniques have been used to analyze the changes in the LST and spectral indices including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI). The data used were based on Landsat Collection 1 Surface Reflectance (SR) images taken in June and August. They were analyzed over 32 years in the years 1987, 1993, 1999, 2009, 2014 and 2019. The study area included the cities of Babolsar and Fereydonkenar and their suburbs in Mazandaran Province in the north of Iran and south of the Caspian Sea. First the tourism zones were separated from other land use zones and then the changes in land use and LST in each of the zones were studied for each year based on the trend of 32-year change. The results of Pearson correlation in the whole area for each main land use zone showed that there was a significant inverse relationship between the LST and the NDVI and MNDWI indices. This relationship was direct and significant for the EBBI index. Moreover, the results of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test showed that the LST changes in the tourism zones during the study period were significantly different from the other zones, so that the tourism zones always experienced lower LST. The findings also showed that, in the tourism zones, the values of the NDVI and MNDWI indices showed an increasing trend compared to the urban zone. Therefore, increasing the values of these indices due to the development of green space and its regular irrigation in tourism zones has led to a significant decrease in the LST. The applied results of this research in the urban planning and tourism literature indicate that any model of physical development such as urban development does not necessarily lead to an increase in the LST, and this is entirely dependent on the physical design strategies.

TI  - Individual Tree Crown Delineation for the Species Classification and Assessment of Vital Status of Forest Stands from UAV Images
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the structure parameters and damage to trees plays an important role in forest management. Remote-sensing data collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides valuable resources to improve the efficiency of decision making. In this work, we propose an approach to enhance algorithms for species classification and assessment of the vital status of forest stands by using automated individual tree crowns delineation (ITCD). The approach can be potentially used for inventory and identifying the health status of trees in regional-scale forest areas. The proposed ITCD algorithm goes through three stages: preprocessing (contrast enhancement), crown segmentation based on wavelet transformation and morphological operations, and boundaries detection. The performance of the ITCD algorithm was demonstrated for different test plots containing homogeneous and complex structured forest stands. For typical scenes, the crown contouring accuracy is about 95%. The pixel-by-pixel classification is based on the ensemble supervised classification method error correcting output codes with the Gaussian kernel support vector machine chosen as a binary learner. We demonstrated that pixel-by-pixel species classification of multi-spectral images can be performed with a total error of about 1%, which is significantly less than by processing RGB images. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in the combined processing of multispectral and RGB photo images.

TI  - Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance: Successes and Lessons Learned in Bangladesh for a Sustainable Path Forward
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We have made considerable progress in setting and scaling up surveillance systems to drive evidence-based policy decisions, but the recent epidemics highlight that current systems are not optimally designed. Good surveillance systems should be coordinated, comprehensive, and adaptive. They should generate data in real time for immediate analysis and intervention, whether for endemic diseases or potential epidemics. Such systems are especially needed in low-resource settings where disease burden is the highest, but tracking systems are the weakest here due to competing priorities and constraints on available resources. In this article, using the examples of 3 large, and mostly successful, infectious disease surveillance studies in Bangladesh, we identify 2 core limitations-the pathogen bias and the vaccine bias-in the way current surveillance programs are designed for low-resource settings. We highlight the strengths of the current Global Invasive Bacterial Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance Network of the World Health Organization and present case studies from Bangladesh to illustrate how this surveillance platform can be leveraged to overcome its limitations. Finally, we propose a set of criteria for building a comprehensive infectious disease surveillance system with the hope of encouraging current systems to use the limited resources as optimally as possible to generate the maximum amount of knowledge.

TI  - Optimization of Sentinel Lymph Node Imaging Methodology Using Anionic Liposome and Hyaluronidase
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node into which lymphatic fluid from tumor tissues flows. The development of a highly sensitive probe for detecting SLNs is desired for the lymph node dissection through intraoperative biopsy. We have previously shown that anionic liposomes tend to accumulate in lymph nodes and that macrophage uptake of liposomes contributes to their accumulation. In the present study, we found that among anionic lipids, phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposomes were substantially taken up by macrophages. We identified a new lipid composition to improve the SNL-selectivity of liposome accumulation based on Design-of-Experiment. The optimized PS-containing particles were more selectively accumulate to SLN lymph nodes than existing imaging agents indocyanine green. These results indicate the effectiveness of PS-containing anionic particles in SLN imaging.

TI  - Fine-Grained Large-Scale Vulnerable Communities Mapping via Satellite Imagery and Population Census Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the challenges in the fight against poverty is the precise localization and assessment of vulnerable communities' sprawl. The characterization of vulnerability is traditionally accomplished using nationwide census exercises, a burdensome process that requires field visits by trained personnel. Unfortunately, most countrywide censuses exercises are conducted only sporadically, making it difficult to track the short-term effect of policies to reduce poverty. This paper introduces a definition of vulnerability following UN-Habitat criteria, assesses different CNN machine learning architectures, and establishes a mapping between satellite images and survey data. Starting with the information corresponding to the 2,178,508 residential blocks recorded in the 2010 Mexican census and multispectral Landsat-7 images, multiple CNN architectures are explored. The best performance is obtained with EfficientNet-B3 achieving an area under the ROC and Precision-Recall curves of 0.9421 and 0.9457, respectively. This article shows that publicly available information, in the form of census data and satellite images, along with standard CNN architectures, may be employed as a stepping stone for the countrywide characterization of vulnerability at the residential block level.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 for Simplifying Soil Sampling and Mapping: Two Case Studies in Umbria, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil-sample collection and strategy are costly and time-consuming endeavors, mainly when the goal is in-field variation mapping that usually requires dense sampling. This study developed and tested a streamlined soil mapping methodology, applicable at the field scale, based on an unsupervised classification of Sentinel-2 (S2) data supporting the definition of reduced soil-sampling schemes. The study occurred in two agricultural fields of 20 hectares each near Deruta, Umbria, Italy. S2 images were acquired for the two bare fields. After a band selection based on bibliography, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and cluster analysis were used to identify points of two reduced-sample schemes. The data obtained by these samplings were used in linear regressions with principal components of the selected S2 bands to produce maps for clay and organic matter (OM). Resultant maps were assessed by analyzing residuals with a conventional soil sampling of 30 soil samples for each field to quantify their accuracy level. Although of limited extent and with a specific focus, the low average errors (Clay +/- 2.71%, OM +/- 0.16%) we obtained using only three soil samples suggest a wider potential for this methodology. The proposed approach, integrating S2 data and traditional soil-sampling methods could considerably reduce soil-sampling time and costs in ordinary and precision agriculture applications.

TI  - Assessment of Empirical and Semi-Analytical Algorithms Using MODIS-Aqua for Representing In-Situ Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) in the Bering, Chukchi, and Western Beaufort Seas of the Pacific Arctic Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed a variety of satellite-based ocean color products derived using MODIS-Aqua to investigate the most accurate empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for representing in-situ chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) across a large latitudinal transect in the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas of the Pacific Arctic region. In particular, we compared the performance of empirical (CDOM index) and several semi-analytical algorithms (quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), Carder, Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM), and GSM-A) with field measurements of CDOM absorption (a(CDOM)) at 412 nanometers (nm) and 443 nm. These algorithms were compared with in-situ CDOM measurements collected on cruises during July 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Our findings show that the QAA a443 and GSM-A a443 algorithms are the most accurate and robust representation of in-situ conditions, and that the GSM-A a443 algorithm is the most accurate algorithm when considering all statistical metrics utilized here. Our further assessments indicate that geographic variables (distance to coast, latitude, and sampling transects) did not obviously relate to algorithm accuracy. In general, none of the algorithms investigated showed a statistically significant agreement with field measurements beyond an approximately +/- 60 h offset, likely owing to the highly variable environmental conditions found across the Pacific Arctic region. As such, we suggest that satellite observations of CDOM in these Arctic regions should not be used to represent in-situ conditions beyond a +/- 60 h timeframe.

TI  - "The Well of Waters": Yahweh's Fresh Water Reservoir beneath His Mountain-Palace
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Noahic Deluge is commonly understood to have resulted from the infiltration of chaos waters into the ordered universe from two sources: one situated above the Raqia. and one underground. This interpretation does not find support in the HB and contradicts the precepts of the cosmological worldview of the ANE. According to Gen 6:17 Yahweh uses one single source of water to flood the land, referred to as "the well of waters." There was a common belief in the ANE that there was a vast reservoir of fresh water in the underworld on the eastern horizon, beneath the palace of the sun god. The waters of Life (Hayya/Ea) therein, which must be distinguished from the saline primordial waters of chaos, were used for divine judgement. In spite of the consensus view that the chaos waters were permitted to enter the cosmos, not only during the Deluge but every time it rained, it is more likely that Yahweh lifted the waters of the well beneath his mountain-palace to execute justice and restore order to the land.

TI  - BRDF Estimations and Normalizations of Sentinel 2 Level 2 Data Using a Kalman-Filtering Approach and Comparisons with RadCalNet Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BRDF estimation aims to characterize the anisotropic behaviour of the observed surface, which is directly related to the type of surface. BRDF theoretical models are then used in the normalization of the satellite-derived observations to virtually replace the sensor at the nadir. Such normalization reinforces the homogeneity within and between satellite-derived time series. Nevertheless, the inversion of the necessary BRDF parameters for the normalization requires the implementation of robust methods to account for the noise in the Level 2 surface reflectances caused by the atmospheric correction process. Here, we compare normalized reflectances obtained with a Kalman filtering approach with i/the classical weighted linear inversion and ii/a normalization performed using the coefficients of the NASA-MODIS BRDF MCD43A1 band 2 product. We show, using the RadCalNet nadir-view reflectances, that the Kalman filtering approach is a more suitable approach for the Sen2Cor level 2 and the selected sites. Using the proposed approach, daily global maps of land surface BRDF coefficients and the derived normalized Sentinel 2 reflectances would be extremely useful to the global and regional climate modelling communities and for the world's cover monitoring.

TI  - Assimilation of OLCI total column water vapour in the Met Office global numerical weather prediction system
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The representation of water vapour in numerical weather prediction models is still subject to significant uncertainties, which are partly due to the lack of observations of water vapour in the lower troposphere over land and sea-ice areas. There are now several satellite datasets of total column water vapour available, which make use of the reflected radiances from the surface in the near-infrared spectral region where there are water vapour absorption bands. The ocean and land cover imager (OLCI) on the Sentinel-3A and 3B satellites measures the top of atmosphere radiances in the near infrared, and a total column water vapour product is retrieved and made available in near real time. Comparisons of the total column water vapour from OLCI with NWP model 6-h forecasts, collocated ground-based GNSS measurements and radiosonde profiles have been undertaken to determine the accuracy of the product. Following the monitoring, some experiments were made to assimilate the OLCI total column water vapour over land using the Met Office 4D-Var assimilation system.

TI  - The Lemko Wedding Song (Ukrainian, Polish, Slovak): Peculiarity and Usage
T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes Lemko's wedding and post-wedding songs in comparison with Polish and Slovak ones. As an integral part of all-Ukrainian ceremonial song fund, Lemky wedding song ritualism is distinguished by some specificity due to Polish and Slovak close proximity. Naturally, Lemko song specificity are best revealed when compared with the similar song traditions of the Western Slavs. The similarity of certain elements is better traced in the wedding song ritualism of the East Slovakian, Ukrainians and Slovaks sons, as compared to the Lemky-Polish neighbourhood. While preserving a lot of archaic forms and elements, the Lemko version of the Ukrainian wedding is characterized by some differences, which reflect Lemko's continuous ethnocultural contacts with neighbouring nations. The wedding song repertory of the three neighbouring nations has been found to impressively reflect its origin from the Proto-Slavic marriage ritualism, based on the monogamous marriage, husbandry lifestyle, close worldview (similar meaning of fire, water, bread, Eden tree, sun-worship, etc.), as well as on the similarity of ritual acts (garlanding, blessing, roundabout the table and dough trough, breaking wedding loaf, etc.). All mentioned above together with the similar dramatization of the wedding ceremony make ethnonational versions of traditional family ritualism - a so-called "Carpathian cycle". The Lemko wedding song content has been found to preserve archaic motives and images of relict Ukrainian repertory with its typical ample song/choral expression of the content of wedding rituals, young couple's and their families' moral and mental state, varied poetic symbolism and stylistics. Long-term endosmosis of cultural, economic, and sociopolitical contacts between neighbouring ethnoses has conditioned the interchange of the elements of wedding song and ritual dramatization with marked Lemko dominant regarding Slovakian wedding song repertory, as well as with regard to the repertory of Polish Gorals, long-standing song strata in particular.

TI  - Multifractal Analysis of a Seismic Moment Distribution Obtained From InSAR Inversion
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) interferograms contain valuable information about the fault systems hidden beneath the surface of the Earth. In a new approach, we aim to fit InSAR ground deformation data using a distribution of multiple seismic point sources whose parameters are found by a genetic algorithm. The resulting source distribution could provide another useful tool in solving the difficult problem of accurately mapping earthquake faults. We apply the algorithm to an ALOS-2 InSAR interferogram and perform a multifractal analysis on the resulting distribution, finding that it exhibits multifractal properties. We report first results and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

TI  - Effects of climate and irrigation on GRACE-based estimates of water storage changes in major US aquifers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding climate and human impacts on water storage is critical for sustainable water-resources management. Here we assessed climate and human drivers of total water storage (TWS) variability from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites compared with drought severity and irrigation water use in 14 major aquifers in the United States. Results show that long-term variability in TWS tracked by GRACE satellites is dominated by interannual variability in most of the 14 major US aquifers. Low TWS trends in the humid eastern U.S. are linked to low drought intensity. Although irrigation pumpage in the humid Mississippi Embayment aquifer exceeded that in the semi-arid California Central Valley, a surprising lack of TWS depletion in the Mississippi Embayment aquifer is attributed to extensive streamflow capture. Marked storage depletion in the semi-arid southwestern Central Valley and south-central High Plains totaled similar to 90 km(3), about three times greater than the capacity of Lake Mead, the largest U.S. reservoir. Depletion in the Central Valley was driven by long-term droughts (<= 5 yr) amplified by switching from mostly surface water to groundwater irrigation. Low or slightly rising TWS trends in the northwestern (Columbia and Snake Basins) US are attributed to dampening drought impacts by mostly surface water irrigation. GRACE satellite data highlight synergies between climate and irrigation, resulting in little impact on TWS in the humid east, amplified TWS depletion in the semi-arid southwest and southcentral US, and dampened TWS deletion in the northwest and north central US Sustainable groundwater management benefits from conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater, inefficient surface water irrigation promoting groundwater recharge, efficient groundwater irrigation minimizing depletion, and increasing managed aquifer recharge. This study has important implications for sustainable water development in many regions globally.

TI  - Cosmopolitanism in Gal 3:28 and the Divine Performative Speech-Act of Paul's Gospel
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR DIE NEUTESTAMENTLICHE WISSENSCHAFT UND DIE KUNDE DER ALTEREN KIRCHE
M3  - Article
AB  - Galatians 3:28 has often been compared and contrasted with ancient conceptions of "cosmopolitanism." However, the present study takes a modern, etic approach to the definition of term, based on the longitudinal investigation of historical trends by a Cambridge working group. Seen from that vantage point, Paul's declaration in Gal 3:28 can be described in terms of the "political cosmo-politanism" that is characteristic of empire-builders in the Ancient Near East and the Mediterranean. At the same time, Gal 3:28 is rooted in Paul's Jewish apocalyptic worldview, especially as exemplified in the Enochic tradition, which had already been interacting with the political cosmopolitanism of pagan empires for centuries.

TI  - An Application of Sea Ice Tracking Algorithm for Fast Ice and Stamukhas Detection in the Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For regional environmental studies it is important to know the location of the fast ice edge which affects the coastal processes in the Arctic. The aim of this study is to develop a new automated method for fast ice delineation from SAR imagery. The method is based on a fine resolution hybrid sea ice tracking algorithm utilizing advantages of feature tracking and cross-correlation approaches. The developed method consists of three main steps: drift field retrieval at sub-kilometer scale, selection of motionless features and edge delineation. The method was tested on a time series of C-band co-polarized (HH) ENVISAT ASAR and Sentinel-1 imagery in the Laptev and East Siberian Seas. The comparison of the retrieved edges with the operational ice charts produced by the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (Russia) showed a good agreement between the data sets with a mean distance between the edges of <15 km. Thanks to the high density of the ice drift product, the method allows for detailed fast ice edge delineation. In addition, large stamukhas with horizontal size of tens of kilometers can be detected. The proposed method can be applied for regional fast ice mapping and large stamukhas detection to aid coastal research. Additionally, the method can serve as a tool for operational sea ice mapping.

TI  - Analysis of Olive Grove Destruction by <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> Bacterium on the Land Surface Temperature in Salento Detected Using Satellite Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural activity replaces natural vegetation with cultivated land and it is a major cause of local and global climate change. Highly specialized agricultural production leads to extensive monoculture farming with a low biodiversity that may cause low landscape resilience. This is the case on the Salento peninsula, in the Apulia Region of Italy, where the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium has caused the mass destruction of olive trees, many of them in monumental groves. The historical land cover that characterized the landscape is currently in a transition phase and can strongly affect climate conditions. This study aims to analyze how the destruction of olive groves by X. fastidiosa affects local climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) data detected by Landsat 8 and MODIS satellites are used as a proxies for microclimate mitigation ecosystem services linked to the evolution of the land cover. Moreover, recurrence quantification analysis was applied to the study of LST evolution. The results showed that olive groves are the least capable forest type for mitigating LST, but they are more capable than farmland, above all in the summer when the air temperature is the highest. The differences in the average LST from 2014 to 2020 between olive groves and farmland ranges from 2.8 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C. Furthermore, the recurrence analysis showed that X. fastidiosa was rapidly changing the LST of the olive groves into values to those of farmland, with a difference in LST reduced to less than a third from the time when the bacterium was identified in Apulia six years ago. The change generated by X. fastidiosa started in 2009 and showed more or less constant behavior after 2010 without substantial variation; therefore, this can serve as the index of a static situation, which can indicate non-recovery or non-transformation of the dying olive groves. Failure to restore the initial environmental conditions can be connected with the slow progress of the uprooting and replacing infected plants, probably due to attempts to save the historic aspect of the landscape by looking for solutions that avoid uprooting the diseased plants. This suggests that social-ecological systems have to be more responsive to phytosanitary epidemics and adapt to ecological processes, which cannot always be easily controlled, to produce more resilient landscapes and avoid unwanted transformations.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF WULAN DELTA IN INDONESIA: CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLUTION, AND CONTROLLING FACTORS
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of the Wulan Delta began after the construction of the Wulan River Canal in 1892. It alters the shoreline erosion and accretion that affect the land dynamics of the coastal area. This study aims to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of the Wulan Delta, including the shoreline and its dynamics, as well as the geomorphological processes that affect it. The shoreline change was extracted digitally from Landsat satellite images and divided into four periods, i.e., 1995-2000, 2000-2011, 2011-2015, and 2015-2020. We used the histogram thresholding method to separate the land from the sea and produce the shoreline as the interface. This research employed field check and focus group discussion for identifying the cause and impact of shoreline dynamics in the research area. The results show that land loss and accumulation over 25 years (1995-2020) are -7.16 km(2) and +6.58 km(2), respectively. In Wulan Delta, the erosion is due to high waves and sedimentation due to mangrove planting and high sediment from the rivers. The development rates of the Wulan Delta for the period of 1995-2020 were 73,200 m(2)/year.

TI  - Seismic Detection of Oceanic Internal Gravity Waves From Subaerial Seismometers
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic internal gravity waves propagate along density stratification within the water column and are ubiquitous. They can propagate thousands of kilometers before breaking in shoaling bathymetry and the ensuing turbulent mixing affects coastal processes and climate feedbacks. Despite their importance, internal waves are intrinsically difficult to detect as they result in only minor amplitude deflection of the sea surface; the need for global detection and long time series of internal waves motivates a search for geophysical detection methods. The pressure coupling of a propagating internal wave with the sloping seafloor provides a potential mechanism to generate seismically observable signals. We use data from the South China Sea where exceptional oceanographic and satellite time series are available for comparison to identify internal wave signals in an onshore passive seismic data set for the first time. We analyze potential seismic signals on broadband seismometers in the context of corroborating oceanographic and satellite data available near Dongsha Atoll in May-June 2019 and find a promising correlation between transient seismic tilt signals and internal wave arrivals and collisions in oceanic and satellite data. It appears that we have successfully detected oceanic internal waves using a subaerial seismometer. This initial detection suggests that the onshore seismic detection and amplitude determination of oceanic internal waves is possible and can potentially be used to expand the historical record by capitalizing on existing island and coastal seismic stations.

TI  - Green gentrification or gentrified greening: Metropolitan Melbourne
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greening is a tool of urban planning to mediate problems related to urban living and betterment of residents' quality of life. Given the inequitable distribution of this urban public health infrastructure, increasing green area within disadvantaged neighborhoods is one of the contemporary initiatives in urban planning. However, some argue that urban greening can have mixed consequences. Specifically, urban greening efforts may lead to "green gentrification", and as a result, can unintentionally displace lower income residents and increase inequities. Despite this, few studies have investigated the relationship between gentrification and urban greening. We aim to empirically answer the questions, "Does urban greening lead to gentrification?" or "Does gentrification lead to urban greening?". We draw on green space data from Landsat and census socioeconomic data over 1996-2016 to analyze the historical data of urban greenness changes and area profile transitions. The result does not indicate any statistically significant evidence that urban greening catalyzes gentrification, but does show that gentrification actuates urban greening. The policy implications are discussed.

TI  - Boots on the Ground and Eyes in the Sky: A Perspective on Estimating Fire Danger from Soil Moisture Content
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing forest and grassland wildfire trends strongly correlated to anthropogenic climate change, assessing wildfire danger is vital to reduce catastrophic human, economic, and environmental loss. From this viewpoint, the authors discuss various approaches deployed to evaluate wildfire danger, from in-situ observations to satellite-based fire prediction systems. Lately, the merit of soil moisture in predicting fuel moisture content and the likelihood of wildfire occurrence has been widely realized. Harmonized soil moisture measurement initiatives via state-of-the-art soil moisture networks have facilitated the use of soil moisture information in developing innovative applications for wildfire prediction and risk management applications. Additionally, the increasing availability of remote-sensing data has enabled the monitoring and modeling of wildfires across various terrestrial ecosystems. When coupled with remotely sensed data, field-based soil moisture measurements have been more valuable predictors of assessing wildfire than alone. However, sensors capable of acquiring higher spectral information and radiometry across large spatiotemporal domains are still lacking. The automation aspect of such extensive data from remote-sensing and field data is needed to rapidly assess wildfire and mitigation of wildfire-related damage at operational scales.

TI  - Extraction and Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Impervious Surfaces over Dongying Based on Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to understand the relationship between the impervious surface area (ISA) distribution, variation trends and potential driving forces over Dongying, Shandong Province. We extracted ISA information from Landsat images with 3-5 year intervals during 1995 to 2018 using Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transform, Pixel Purity Index (PPI), and Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA), followed by the analysis on three driving forces of ISA expansion (physical geography, socioeconomic factors, and urban cultural features). Our results show the retrieved ISA thematic map fit the limited requirement of root mean square error (RMSE). The correct classification accuracy of ISA is greater than 83.08%. Further, the cross-comparison exhibits the general consistent with the ISA distribution of the land use classification map published by the National Basic Geographic Information Center. The gradual increasing trend can be captured on the expansion of ISA from 1995 to 2018. Despite of the central region always shown as the high ISA density, it still keeps increasing annually and radiating the surrounding region, especially in the southward which has formed into a new large-scale and high intensity of ISA in 2015-2018. Though the ISA patches scattered in the west region or along the northern and eastern part of the ocean coastline are still small, the expansion trend of ISA can be detected. The expansion intensity index (EII) of ISA measuring the situation of its expansion changes from the lowest value 0.12% between 1995 and 2000 up to the highest 0.73% between 2000 and 2005. Richly endowed by nature, the city's natural geographical environment provides an elevated chance of further urbanization. The rapid increase of regional economy provides a fundamental driving force for expanding ISAs. The development of urban culture promotes the sustainable development of ISAs. Our results provide a scientific basis for future urban land use management, construction planning, and environmental protection in Dongying.

TI  - Multiparameter Estimation From Landsat Observations With Topographic Consideration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of high-spatial-resolution satellite data have been increasing in recent years owing to improvements in sensor techniques, and the errors in estimated parameters induced by ignoring topographic effects are increasingly stressed because their effects are important for parameter retrieval from high-spatial-resolution satellite observations. A coupled surface-atmosphere model is employed to develop a two-step multiparameter estimation scheme to simultaneously estimate multiple parameters (leaf area index, LAI; aerosol optical depth, AOD; photosynthetically active radiation, PAR; incident shortwave radiation, ISR; surface albedo, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, FAPAR) from long-term Landsat 4-8 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. First, the influential parameters of the coupled model are retrieved through optimization retrieval strategies. Then, these estimated parameters are entered into the coupled model to compute the PAR, ISR, surface reflectance, surface albedo, and FAPAR. Validation of this scheme with in situ measurements from 57 sites demonstrates that it can successfully estimate multiple parameters from Landsat TOA data, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of LAI, AOD, FAPAR, visible albedo, shortwave albedo, PAR, and ISR of 0.69, 0.16, 0.13, 0.034, 0.047, 26.80, and 64.28 W/m(2), respectively. In the two-step multiparameter estimation scheme, atmospheric and topographic corrections of satellite observations are avoided because the atmospheric and topographic effects are incorporated, and the surface anisotropy is also effectively considered. In addition, by using the two-step multiparameter estimation scheme, physical connections among the multiple parameters are ensured since they are estimated from the same physical model.

TI  - Dual Attention Feature Fusion and Adaptive Context for Accurate Segmentation of Very High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of high-resolution remote sensing images aims to obtain pixel-level land cover understanding, which is often modeled as semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. In recent years, convolutional network (CNN)-based land cover classification methods have achieved great advancement. However, previous methods fail to generate fine segmentation results, especially for the object boundary pixels. In order to obtain boundary-preserving predictions, we first propose to incorporate spatially adapting contextual cues. In this way, objects with similar appearance can be effectively distinguished with the extracted global contextual cues, which are very helpful to identify pixels near object boundaries. On this basis, low-level spatial details and high-level semantic cues are effectively fused with the help of our proposed dual attention mechanism. Concretely, when fusing multi-level features, we utilize the dual attention feature fusion module based on both spatial and channel attention mechanisms to relieve the influence of the large gap, and further improve the segmentation accuracy of pixels near object boundaries. Extensive experiments were carried out on the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Vaihingen data and GaoFen-2 data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our method achieves better performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Improving the Robustness of the MTI-Estimated Mining-Induced 3D Time-Series Displacements with a Logistic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The previous multi-track InSAR (MTI) method can be used to retrieve mining-induced three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements with high spatial-temporal resolution by incorporating multi-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with a prior model. However, due to the track-by-track strategy used in the previous MTI method, no redundant observations are provided to estimate 3D displacements, causing poor robustness and further degrading the accuracy of the 3D displacement estimation. This study presents an improved MTI method to significantly improve the robustness of the 3D mining displacements derived by the previous MTI method. In this new method, a fused-track strategy, instead of the previous track-by-track one, is proposed to process the multi-track InSAR measurements by introducing a logistic model. In doing so, redundant observations are generated and further incorporated into the prior model to solve 3D displacements. The improved MTI method was tested on the Datong coal mining area, China, with Sentinel-1 InSAR datasets from three tracks. The results show that the 3D mining displacements estimated by the improved MTI method had the same spatial-temporal resolution as those estimated by the previous MTI method and about 33.5% better accuracy. The more accurate 3D displacements retrieved from the improved MTI method can offer better data for scientifically understanding the mechanism of mining deformation and assessing mining-related geohazards.

TI  - NESZ Estimation and Calibration for Gaofen-3 Polarimetric Products by the Minimum Noise Envelope Estimator
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Gaofen-3 satellite currently provides us with an open way to access fully polarimetric data in the C-band frequency. The noise equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) is a crucial factor when calibrating the additive noise in radar imagery. For most radar sensors, NESZ coefficients are stored in header files, but these are not provided for the Gaofen-3 products. The minimum eigenvalue estimator (MEE) and maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are the two most common techniques used to derive the NESZ from polarimetric imagery. Nevertheless, the bias has been found to be higher than 5 dB compared with the noise measurement circuit (NMC) of the hardware. In this article, we propose a minimum noise envelope estimator (MNEE) for the robust estimation of the Gaofen-3 NESZ. In this article, we carried out an in-depth investigation to analyze the error sources of the MEE and MLE techniques. Based on our analysis, the MNEE framework requires the use of the ocean surface as a reference, and MNEE is combined with the minimum operation to suppress overestimation. In the experimental section, we describe how we validated the proposed algorithm with Radarsat-2 images, and the MNEE is treated as a tool to estimate the NESZ of Gaofen-3 polarimetric products. We found that the Gaofen-3 NESZ is generally less than -20 dB, which satisfies the design specification. The range-dependent NESZ coefficients are provided here to allow convenient noise correction for Gaofen-3 data users.

TI  - Hydrological control shift from river level to rainfall in the reactivated Guobu slope besides the Laxiwa hydropower station in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are common geohazards associated with natural drivers such as precipitation, land degradation, toe erosion by rivers and wave attack, and ground shaking. On the other hand, human alterations such as inundation by water impoundment or rapid drawdown may also destabilize the surrounding slopes. The Guobu slope is an ancient rockslide on the banks of the Laxiwa hydropower station reservoir (China), which reactivated during the reservoir impoundment in 2009. We extracted three-dimensional surface displacements with azimuth and range radar interferometry using European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-1 and German Aerospace Center's TerraSAR-X data during 20152019. The upper part of the Guobu rockslide is characterized by toppling and is mostly subsiding with maximum rates over 0.4 m/yr and 0.7 m/yr in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. During filling of the reservoir prior to 2014, there was a long-wavelength in-phase response between rising reservoir level and GPS-observed increased slope movements. After the reservoir water level stabilized from 2015 to 2019, the slide movement became seasonal and we see a correlation between rainfall and landslide movement. These observations suggest that the slide motion is now primarily controlled by rainfall. The spatiotemporal landslide displacements allow us to estimate the hydraulic diffusivity of the rock mass, to be on the order (similar to 1.05 x 10(-7) m(2)/s) and the thickness of the moving rock mass (similar to 200 m). Our results demonstrate that InSAR is a useful tool for monitoring the rockslide movement as a function of seasonal precipitation.

TI  - Temporal Analysis of Changes in Anthropogenic Emissions and Urban Heat Islands during COVID-19 Restrictions in Gauteng Province, South Africa
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions are significant drivers of temperature rises in major urban areas across the globe. Waste heat and exhaust emissions from motor vehicles and industrial combustion cause the warming of cities, resulting in microclimates' changes. Recently, national lockdown regulations restricting movement and socio-economic activities to curb the spread of a novel COVID-19 and the associated deaths have been implemented in various countries worldwide. Consequently, these unprecedented restrictions resulted in reductions in traffic volumes and industrial activities in most urban areas across the world. Thus, it was hypothesised that these reductions in traffic congestion and industrial activities in cities would reduce both air pollutants and thermal radiation. Using multisource data from Sentinel-5P, MERRA-2, and MODIS, this study assessed the short-term trends in emissions and land surface temperature in South Africa's economic hub, i.e., Gauteng Province. Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) trend analysis were used to characterise trends in CO, SO2, SO4, long-wave radiation (LWR), and land surface temperature (LST) at periods corresponding to various lockdown restrictions. The results showed a significant decline in atmospheric pollutants at Level-5 lockdown restrictions, followed by an abrupt increase as the regulations were eased to Level-4 lockdown. Similarly, LST and surface urban heat island (SUHI) reduced when compared to the previous year. Therefore, the lockdown restrictions provided an experimental scenario in which pollutants could be drastically reduced, thus accentuated the human impact on microclimates.

TI  - Fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in mapping the impervious surfaces at city scale
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization creates new development in open spaces and agricultural fields, synonymous with increasing impervious surfaces. Such surfaces restrain the natural infiltration of water, and directly affect the non-point source pollution. Thus, consequential events like flooding and surface water degradation require spatial and quantitative information on impervious surfaces. Remote sensing technologies are widely used in impervious surface mapping of various geographical locations for environmental monitoring. In this study, the datasets from recently launched European Space Agency satellites (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) and random forest classifier are used. The impervious surface growth of the study area, Lahore city, in 2015 and 2021, and growth trends are assessed. Results are validated with classification accuracy and comparison with similar datasets. The objective is to develop a reliable impervious surface mapping method with land cover quantification technique from multisource datasets. With a chi-square value of greater than 3.84 obtained from the McNemar test, the performance of fused data was superior to that of optical alone data in the classification. Over a 5-year period, Lahore grew at an annual rate of 2.14% comparable to the findings of Copernicus Land Services and the Atlas of Urban Expansion with an underestimation of 1% and 8.75%, respectively. Improvements in overall accuracy (2.7%) and kappa coefficient (5%) were seen in classified maps from fused datasets. Fusion of Sentinel datasets provide a reliable means of impervious surface mapping at city scale as an indicator of environmental quality which is valuable for the sustainable management of the city.

TI  - Population fluctuations of <i>Diaphorina citri</i> and its natural enemies in response to various management practices in Florida
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a serious threat to citrus production because it transmits the bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus Jagoueix (Hyphomicrobiales: Rhizobiaceae), that causes huanglongbing. Currently, there is no cure for huanglongbing, and vector management is implemented to reduce the spread of pathogen. In Florida, calendar-based insecticide application had been used widely for D. citri management, but the evolution of insecticide resistance in D. citri and associated reductions of natural enemy populations mandate more sustainable approaches. The objective of our study was to compare the effects of organic management versus intermittent use of conventional insecticides on population suppression of D. citri by natural enemies in Florida. We conducted a survey of natural enemies in citrus groves that were managed organically versus intermittently treated with conventional insecticides from Mar to Dec 2019. We also compared mortality of D. citri in those groves by deploying sentinel psyllids on leaf flush with or without exclusion cages. The abundance of natural enemies was recorded by visual observations made on tree branches for 2 min intervals. Finally, we estimated tree flush density and monitored adult D. citri populations. Survival of sentinel D. citri was significantly lower on uncaged flush when natural enemies had access to eggs and nymphs during spring, summer, and fall in organic groves; however, such a difference was not observed between caged and uncaged D. citri in intermittently sprayed groves, particularly during summer and fall. Similarly, organic sites had lower numbers of adult D. citri compared to intermittently sprayed sites throughout most of the sampling period, suggesting that natural enemies contributed to regulation of D. citri populations in organic groves more so than in the intermittently treated conventional groves. The most common natural enemies found were Coccinellidae, Chrysopidae, Formicidae, Eulophidae, Syrphidae, Dolichopodidae, and Arachnida. Among these groups, formicids were most abundant in organic groves, whereas dolichopodids and coccinellids were most abundant in intermittently managed groves. Our results suggest that intermittent spraying for D. citri with conventional insecticides could affect activity of natural enemies even though such practices did not entirely eliminate their populations.

TI  - Crop Classification of Satellite Imagery Using Synthetic Multitemporal and Multispectral Images in Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for new tools for mass remote sensing of crops, combined with the open and free availability of satellite imagery, has prompted the development of new methods for crop classification. Because this classification is frequently required to be completed within a specific time frame, performance is also essential. In this work, we propose a new method that creates synthetic images by extracting satellite data at the pixel level, processing all available bands, as well as their data distributed over time considering images from multiple dates. With this approach, data from images of Sentinel-2 are used by a deep convolutional network system, which will extract the necessary information to discern between different types of crops over a year after being trained with data from previous years. Following the proposed methodology, it is possible to classify crops and distinguish between several crop classes while also being computationally low-cost. A software system that implements this method has been used in an area of Extremadura (Spain) as a complementary monitoring tool for the subsidies supported by the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union.

AB  - Cancel culture and wokeism are dangerous trends that are increasing in their intensity and the self-destruction of Western civilization is a matter of time as the underlying historical myths and value/normative philosophies that led to its global hegemony is destroyed by a messianic ideology that is engineering an exclusive homogenous worldview in the name of pluralism and inclusivity. In this world of Orwellian doublespeak, the current struggle for ideological hegemony is taking place in the information space for hearts and minds in the cognitive realm. Social media is the very frontline in the future and even very existence of Western civilization, and it has chosen to support those waging the neo-liberal cancel culture in the name of justice, liberation and equality.

TI  - Evaluation of Land Use and Land Cover Transformation and Urban Dynamics Using Multi-Temporal Satellite Data
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of Land use and land cover (LULC) transformations at different spatial levels is crucial in several areas, including protection of the environment, resource utilization, planning and sustainability. The present work is an attempt to carry out a detailed study of LULC transformations and to analyze urban areas in Srinagar city (India) using multi-temporal Landsat satellite data for the year 1995 to 2019. Seven different LULC classes were delineated for the selected periods by a supervised method using maximum likelihood classifier algorithm in ERDAS Imagine 14. The findings indicate that over the specified periods substantial changes have occurred in terms of LULC. Overall seven categories were identified and, throughout studies, three trends of LULC change were observed (1) continuous expansion of the area under the class of built-up, barren, horticulture (2) agriculture, water and marshy class are continuously decreasing (3) increase (1995-2010) and decrease (2010-2019) in forest classes between two periods. During the study period, in built-up (+), horticulture (+), agriculture (-) water (-) and marshes (-) most significant changes have been observed, referencing to change in percentage within each class, the maximum variability was observed in built-up (148.07%), horticulture (40.87%), marshes (-58.37%), water (-22%) and agriculture (-35.38%). For quantitative assessment changes Land Consumption Rate (LCR) and Land Absorption Coefficient (LAC) were introduced. The overall research scenario shows that the LULC transition in the city is very evident. The rapid change of LULC in the ecologically sensitive Srinagar city is driven mainly by anthropogenic sources and has a negative environmental influence.

TI  - Relationship of the Ozone Mini-Hole Over Siberia in January 2016 to Atmospheric Blocking
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite data and reanalysis data, the characteristics and mechanisms of the formation of an ozone "mini-hole" in the atmosphere over Siberia in the winter of 2015-2016 have been investigated. The relationship between the regional negative anomaly of the total ozone content (TOC), reaching -140 Dobson units, with atmospheric blocking was established. The TOC anomaly was mainly due to a decrease in the ozone content in the lower stratosphere, reaching 50% near the 70 hPa level. With the key contribution of atmospheric dynamic processes to the formation of the ozone "mini-hole," the possibility of the contribution of ozone destruction in heterogeneous reactions on the surface of polar stratospheric clouds, due to a strong decrease in temperature in the stratosphere above the blocking region, was noted.

Dukhnovych (1803-1865) - a talented poet, prose writer, publicist, historian, ethnographer, playwright, teacher, publisher, a well-known "Buditel'" (i.e. awakener) of the Carpathian people. The author studies and describes Dukhnovych's creative heritage to define the main directions of his cultural and educational activities in the fields of philosophy, history, geography, pedagogy, socio-culture, linguistics, theology, ethnography, agriculture, phytotherapy, etc. Dukhnovich was a convinced traditional educator, who sincerely believed that education can significantly alleviate the plight of the masses. He founded educational societies, organized more than 70 elementary schools, published textbooks, almanacs, calendars. He supported several gymnasiums in Subcarpathian Rus, where teaching was conducted in Russian. Dukhnovich established a scholarship fund for poor pupils and students, organized free cafeterias, etc. The analysis of his epistolary, autobiographical materials, and works of fiction provide an insight into the socio-political and cultural life of the Rusins in the middle of the 19th century. Dukhnovich's creative heritage includes the first "Primer" for public schools ("Reading Book for Beginners" (1847)); the first textbooks on geography ("A Short Landpiece for Young Rusins" (1851)); history ("General History for Young Rusins" (1851), "The True History of the Carpathossians, or Hungarian Rusins" (1853)); the ethnographic work "On the Peoples of the Extreme or Ugric Carpathians, living near the Beskid in the Zemplinska, Uzhhorod and Sharisha capitals" (1848); "Abridged Grammar of the Written Russian language" (1853); "Folk Pedagogy for the Benefit of Rural Teachers" (1857), which was the first textbook on pedagogy in Western Ukraine published in Lvov; "Menology" (1850, 1851, 1854, 1857), other teaching manuals, articles, poetic works, dumas, and plays. His poem "Vruchanie" became the national anthem of Ugrian Rus. As a democratic educator, he convinced many that the active national and cultural life of the Rusins fully depends on the dissimination of education among the people to bring up the younger generation in the vein of virtue and national dignity. By his personal example, Dukhnovich lead people to spiritual dimensions and influences the worldview and patriotism of the intelligentsia in Subcarpathian Rus. He made a significant contribution to the education of the people, laid the foundations for many cultural and educational societies in Subcarpathian Rus in the 19th century and later - not only in his native land, but also far beyond its borders.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation with the S-SEBI Method from Landsat 8 Data against Lysimeter Measurements at the Barrax Site, Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a variable of the climatic system and hydrological cycle that plays an important role in biosphere-atmosphere-hydrosphere interactions. In this paper, remote sensing-based ET estimates with the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) model using Landsat 8 data were compared with in situ lysimeter measurements for different land covers (Grass, Wheat, Barley, and Vineyard) at the Barrax site, Spain, for the period 2014-2018. Daily estimates produced superior performance than hourly estimates in all the land covers, with an average difference of 12% and 15% for daily and hourly ET estimates, respectively. Grass and Vineyard showed the best performance, with an RMSE of 0.10 mm/h and 0.09 mm/h and 1.11 mm/day and 0.63 mm/day, respectively. Thus, the S-SEBI model is able to retrieve ET from Landsat 8 data with an average RMSE for daily ET of 0.86 mm/day. Some model uncertainties were also analyzed, and we concluded that the overpass of the Landsat missions represents neither the maximum daily ET nor the average daily ET, which contributes to an increase in errors in the estimated ET. However, the S-SEBI model can be used to operationally retrieve ET from agriculture sites with good accuracy and sufficient variation between pixels, thus being a suitable option to be adopted into operational ET remote sensing programs for irrigation scheduling or other purposes.

TI  - Land Use Land Cover Classification with U-Net: Advantages of Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The U-net is nowadays among the most popular deep learning algorithms for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping; nevertheless, it has rarely been used with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) imagery. On the other hand, the discrimination between plantations and forests in LULC maps has been emphasized, especially for tropical areas, due to their differences in biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. In this study, we trained a U-net using different imagery inputs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, MS, SAR and a combination of both (MS + SAR); while a random forests algorithm (RF) with the MS + SAR input was also trained to evaluate the difference in algorithm selection. The classification system included ten classes, including old-growth and secondary forests, as well as old-growth and young plantations. The most accurate results were obtained with the MS + SAR U-net, where the highest overall accuracy (0.76) and average F1-score (0.58) were achieved. Although MS + SAR and MS U-nets gave similar results for almost all of the classes, for old-growth plantations and secondary forest, the addition of the SAR band caused an F1-score increment of 0.08-0.11 (0.62 vs. 0.54 and 0.45 vs. 0.34, respectively). Consecutively, in comparison with the MS + SAR RF, the MS + SAR U-net obtained higher F1-scores for almost all the classes. Our results show that using the U-net with a combined input of SAR and MS images enabled a higher F1-score and accuracy for a detailed LULC map, in comparison with other evaluated methods.

TI  - Magnetometer Calibration Based on the CHAOS-7 Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a method for the in-orbit calibration of body-mounted magnetometers based on the CHAOS-7 geomagnetic field model. The code is designed to find the true calibration parameters autonomously by using only the onboard magnetometer data and the corresponding CHAOS outputs. As the model output and satellite data have different coordinate systems, they are first transformed to a Star Tracker Coordinate (STC). Then, non-linear optimization processes are run to minimize the differences between the CHAOS-7 model and satellite data in the STC. The process finally searches out a suite of calibration parameters that can maximize the model-data agreement. These parameters include the instrument gain, offset, axis orthogonality, and Euler rotation matrices between the magnetometer frame and the STC. To validate the performance of the Python code, we first produce pseudo satellite data by convoluting CHAOS-7 model outputs with a prescribed set of the 'true' calibration parameters. Then, we let the code autonomously undistort the pseudo satellite data through optimization processes, which ultimately track down the initially prescribed calibration parameters. The reconstructed parameters are in good agreement with the prescribed (true) ones, which demonstrates that the code can be used for actual instrument data calibration. This study is performed using Python 3.8.5, NumPy 1.19.2, SciPy 1.6, AstroPy 4.2, SpacePy 0.2.1, and ChaosmagPy 0.5 including the CHAOS-7.6 geomagnetic field model. This code will be utilized for processing NextSat-1 and Small scale magNetospheric and Ionospheric Plasma Experiment (SNIPE) data in the future.

TI  - Reconstruction of Historical Land Surface Albedo Changes in China From 850 to 2015 Using Land Use Harmonization Data and Albedo Look-Up Maps
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is a critical parameter of the Earth's energy budget and has been greatly altered by climate change and human activities. To improve our understanding of historical land surface albedo changes and their climatic effects before the satellite remote sensing era, we reconstructed land surface albedo in China from 850 to 2015 using the historical land use harmonization version 2 (LUH2) data set and albedo look-up maps, and estimated the radiative forcing induced by land surface albedo changes using atmospheric radiative kernels. The reconstruction results showed that the annual-mean land surface albedo in China increased by 0.00110 during 850-2015, and the rate of increase was accelerated by the expansion of croplands during recent centuries. The most significant increases in land surface albedo were found in the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH; +0.00646) and Northeast China (NE; +0.00501), which were primarily driven by anthropogenic land cover transformations (e.g., land reclamation, deforestation, and urbanization) and can be enhanced by the vegetation masking effect on snow cover. The radiative forcing induced by land surface albedo changes in China during 850-2015 and 1750-2015 was -0.09 +/- 0.04 and -0.06 +/- 0.02 W m(-2), respectively, which indicated that the land surface albedo changes produced a slight climate cooling effect, helping to offset the warming effect caused by greenhouse gas emissions.Plain Language Summary As an indicator for denoting the reflectance properties of land surfaces, albedo varies with land cover and geophysical properties. In the recent decades, the satellite observations have demonstrated that the land surface albedo on global and regional scales has been greatly altered by global climate change and human activities. However, because land surface albedo before the satellite era cannot be directly acquired by measurements, historical land surface albedo changes must be obtained using reconstructions and model simulations. Herein, we reconstructed the historical land surface albedo changes in China from 850 to 2015 using land use harmonization data and albedo look-up maps. We found that the land surface albedo in China increased by 0.00110 during 850-2015 due to anthropogenic land cover transformations (e.g., land reclamation, deforestation, and urbanization) and the vegetation masking effect on snow cover. The results indicated that the historical changes of land surface albedo in China produced a slight climate cooling effect, helping to offset the warming effect caused by greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Estimation of Winter Wheat Yield from UAV-Based Multi-Temporal Imagery Using Crop Allometric Relationship and SAFY Model
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield prediction and estimation play essential roles in the precision crop management system. The Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) has been applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based data to provide high spatial yield prediction and estimation for winter wheat. However, this crop model relies on the relationship between crop leaf weight and biomass, which only considers the contribution of leaves on the final biomass and yield calculation. This study developed the modified SAFY-height model by incorporating an allometric relationship between ground-based measured crop height and biomass. A piecewise linear regression model is used to establish the relationship between crop height and biomass. The parameters of the modified SAFY-height model are calibrated using ground measurements. Then, the calibrated modified SAFY-height model is applied on the UAV-based photogrammetric point cloud derived crop height and effective leaf area index (LAIe) maps to predict winter wheat yield. The growing accumulated temperature turning points of an allometric relationship between crop height and biomass is 712 degrees C. The modified SAFY-height model, relative to traditional SAFY, provided more accurate yield estimation for areas with LAI higher than 1.01 m(2)/m(2). The RMSE and RRMSE are improved by 3.3% and 0.5%, respectively.

TI  - Secondary Iron Mineral Detection via Hyperspectral Unmixing Analysis with Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The exposition of minerals to oxygen as well as non-treated tailings in mining activities alter the balance of the ecosystem, specifically leading to the generation of acidic solutions in the presence of sulfidic minerals. Several secondary iron minerals are precipitated in these settings that can be detected via remote sensing applications. The purpose of this research is to investigate the capacity of hyperspectral analysis to determine the abundance of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)-indicator secondary iron minerals in mine sites with the guidance of ground truth information. To this end, we focus on an abandoned coal mine site in Turkey to detect secondary iron minerals associated with AMD via multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery, in accordance with the laboratory analysis of fieldcollected samples through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Inductive Coupled Plasma (ICP), and ASD spectral analysis. In relation with the conducted laboratory XRD and ICP results, the proposed methodology first reveals the iron-induced absorption feature located between 700 and 900 nm on field-collected ASD spectra and reference USGS spectra through a baseline method, namely parabola fitting method. The subsequent remote sensing analysis then applies hyperspectral unmixing to Sentinel-2 imagery and identifies the spectral endmember indicating iron-absorption behavior by computing its spectral angle distance to reference spectra. The experiments reveal that while the iron absorption characteristics are not apparent in pixel spectra, the utilized unmixing methodology enables capturing of those features at sub-pixel level on the resulting endmembers. Second, the comparison between the calculated abundances with unmixing and iron levels obtained with ground based ICP analysis indicate coherent correlation values. Finally, among the utilized unmixing methods, the performance of SISAL is found better than MVSA with the resulting correlation values of 0.76 and 0.63, respectively, while also returning closer endmembers to the reference iron spectra. The performed research demonstrates the potential of hyperspectral applications on Sentinel-2 data to uncover the sub-pixel iron-induced spectral features in the visible region, proving compatible results between the spectral and laboratory analysis.

TI  - How to recognize different types of trees from quite a long way away: combining UAV and spaceborne imagery for stand-level tree species identification
T2  - JOURNAL OF UNMANNED VEHICLE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand how a forest may respond to environmental changes or develop over time, it is necessary to examine broad, landscape level factors. With the arrival of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the combination of both spaceborne data with high resolution UAV data can provide foresters and biologists with powerful tools to classify canopies to the species level, which we illustrate here. We combine imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) of the Landsat 8 satellite with aerial imagery from a Phantom 4 UAV to map canopy composition of three tree species. We manually delineated dense stands of each tree species in the UAV imagery to extract training samples from an OLI true colour composite image to perform a fuzzy membership analysis and calculate the maximum likelihood that an individual pixel represented a particular species. We verified the accuracy of our analysis finding an overall accuracy of 0.796 and a Kappa statistic of 0.728. We consider these results to be a strong demonstration of the value of using UAV and satellite imagery in tandem to investigate forest-wide effects at an individual tree level.

TI  - Understanding Top-of-Atmosphere Flux Bias in the AeroCom Phase III Models: A Clear-Sky Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biases in aerosol optical depths (AOD) and land surface albedos in the AeroCom models are manifested in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) clear-sky reflected shortwave (SW) fluxes. Biases in the SW fluxes from AeroCom models are quantitatively related to biases in AOD and land surface albedo by using their radiative kernels. Over ocean, AOD contributes about 25% to the 60 degrees S-60 degrees N mean SW flux bias for the multi-model mean (MMM) result. Over land, AOD and land surface albedo contribute about 40% and 30%, respectively, to the 60 degrees S-60 degrees N mean SW flux bias for the MMM result. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of the SW flux biases derived from the radiative kernels are very similar to those between models and CERES observation, with the correlation coefficient of 0.6 over ocean and 0.76 over land for MMM using data of 2010. Satellite data used in this evaluation are derived independently from each other, consistencies in their bias patterns when compared with model simulations suggest that these patterns are robust. This highlights the importance of evaluating related variables in a synergistic manner to provide an unambiguous assessment of the models, as results from single parameter assessments are often confounded by measurement uncertainty. Model biases in land surface albedos can and must be corrected to accurately calculate TOA flux. We also compare the AOD trend from three models with the observation-based counterpart. These models reproduce all notable trends in AOD except the decreasing trend over eastern China and the adjacent oceanic regions due to limitations in the emission data set.

TI  - Monitoring Water and Energy Cycles at Climate Scale in the Third Pole Environment (CLIMATE-TPE)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the water and energy cycles at climate scale in the Third Pole Environment is essential for assessing and understanding the causes of changes in the cryosphere and hydrosphere in relation to changes of plateau atmosphere in the Asian monsoon system and for predicting the possible changes in water resources in South and East Asia. This paper reports the following results: (1) A platform of in situ observation stations is briefly described for quantifying the interactions in hydrosphere-pedosphere-atmosphere-cryosphere-biosphere over the Tibetan Plateau. (2) A multiyear in situ L-Band microwave radiometry of land surface processes is used to develop a new microwave radiative transfer modeling system. This new system improves the modeling of brightness temperature in both horizontal and vertical polarization. (3) A multiyear (2001-2018) monthly terrestrial actual evapotranspiration and its spatial distribution on the Tibetan Plateau is generated using the surface energy balance system (SEBS) forced by a combination of meteorological and satellite data. (4) A comparison of four large scale soil moisture products to in situ measurements is presented. (5) The trajectory of water vapor transport in the canyon area of Southeast Tibet in different seasons is analyzed, and (6) the vertical water vapor exchange between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere in different seasons is presented.

TI  - Shoreline change study between Vembar and Tharuvaikulam coastal zones along the coast of Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu, India, using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change study is very challenging for any coastal scientists because of its dynamic changes. Erosion and accretion processes directly control the shoreline and coastal landforms. The present study is attempted to assess the shoreline changes between the Vembar and Tharuvaikulam coast of the Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu, India. Both the places were regarded as two zones viz. Vembar and Tharuvaikulam zone. These zones are further sub-divided into three grids to understand and mark the erosion and deposition zones. The shorelines were digitized from satellite images of Landsat - 5 (1997) and Landsat - 8 (2018), and also the base details were extracted from a survey of India (SOI, 1968). These shorelines were taken to Geographic Information System for overlay analysis to determine the extent of erosion and accretion in the study area. The result of this study shows that during the period 1968-1997, Vembar and Tharuvaikulam zones have noticed accretion with a rate of 6.9 m(2)/y and 4.5 m(2)/y, respectively. Whereas, during the period 1997 - 2018, the Vembar zone was subjected to erosion with a rate of -1 m(2)/y. While in the Tharuvaikulam zone, the accretion process has reduced with a rate of 0.1 m(2)/y. The study results have shown that the Vembar zone has undergone erosion, whereas; the Tharuvaikulam zone has undergone both erosion and accretion. The accretion process rate is less compared to the erosion process during 1968 - 1997. The study concludes that the erosion is increasing due to natural and human intervention.

TI  - Transcending the Technocratic Mentality through the Humanities
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Catholic education has a long tradition of engagement with the liberal arts and especially the humanities. The place of the humanities today in the curriculum is under threat for several reasons, one being the predominance of the technocratic mentality. This paper revisits (in three steps) the contested issue of the role of the humanities in education. First, I review arguments about the role of the humanities within education. Second, some of the defects of the technocratic mentality are pointed out. Third, a Christian lens for viewing the humanities is deployed. Here I propose that the humanities play a valuable role in nurturing the imagination, thereby contributing both to a capacity to transcend the technocratic outlook and to the development of the holistic and humanising education that is central to a Catholic worldview.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms for Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) Estimation Based on Landsat 8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is crucial in the biogeochemical cycle and carbon cycle of aquatic environments. However, in inland waters, remotely sensed estimates of CDOM remain challenging due to the low optical signal of CDOM and complex optical conditions. Therefore, developing efficient, practical and robust models to estimate CDOM absorption coefficient in inland waters is essential for successful water environment monitoring and management. We examined and improved different machine learning algorithms using extensive CDOM measurements and Landsat 8 images covering different trophic states to develop the robust CDOM estimation model. The algorithms were evaluated via 111 Landsat 8 images and 1708 field measurements covering CDOM light absorption coefficient a(254) from 2.64 to 34.04 m(-1). Overall, the four machine learning algorithms achieved more than 70% accuracy for CDOM absorption coefficient estimation. Based on model training, validation and the application on Landsat 8 OLI images, we found that the Gaussian process regression (GPR) had higher stability and estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.74, mean relative error (MRE) = 22.2%) than the other models. The estimation accuracy and MRE were R-2 = 0.75 and MRE = 22.5% for backpropagation (BP) neural network, R-2 = 0.71 and MRE = 24.4% for random forest regression (RFR) and R-2 = 0.71 and MRE = 24.4% for support vector regression (SVR). In contrast, the best three empirical models had estimation accuracies of R-2 less than 0.56. The model accuracies applied to Landsat images of Lake Qiandaohu (oligo-mesotrophic state) were better than those of Lake Taihu (eutrophic state) because of the more complex optical conditions in eutrophic lakes. Therefore, machine learning algorithms have great potential for CDOM monitoring in inland waters based on large datasets. Our study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms are available to map CDOM spatial-temporal patterns in inland waters.

TI  - Retrieving High-Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth from GF-4 PMS Imagery in Eastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen 4 (GF-4) is a geostationary satellite, with a panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS) onboard, and has great potential in observing atmospheric aerosols. In this study, we developed an aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm for the GF-4 satellite. AOD retrieval was realized based on the pre-calculated surface reflectance database and 6S radiative transfer model. We customized the unique aerosol type according to the long time series aerosol parameters provided by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site. The solar zenith angle, relative azimuth angle, and satellite zenith angle of the GF-4 panchromatic multispectral sensor image were calculated pixel-by-pixel. Our 1 km AOD retrievals were validated against AERONET Version 3 measurements and compared with MOD04 C6 AOD products at different resolutions. The results showed that our GF-4 AOD algorithm had a good robustness in both bright urban areas and dark rural areas. A total of 71.33% of the AOD retrievals fell within the expected errors of +/-(0.05% + 20%); root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.922 and 0.122, respectively. The accuracy of GF-4 AOD in rural areas was slightly higher than that in urban areas. In comparison with MOD04 products, the accuracy of GF-4 AOD was much higher than that of MOD04 3 km and 10 km dark target AOD, but slightly worse than that of MOD04 10 km deep blue AOD. For different values of land surface reflectance (LSR), the accuracy of GF-4 AOD gradually deteriorated with an increase in the LSR. These results have theoretical and practical significance for aerosol research and can improve retrieval algorithms using the GF-4 satellite.

TI  - Habitat connectivity for endangered Indochinese tigers in Thailand
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat connectivity is crucial for the conservation of species restricted to fragmented populations within human-dominated landscapes. However, identifying habitat connectivity for apex predators is challenging because trophic interactions between primary productivity and prey species influence both the distribution of habitats, and predator movement. Our goal was to assess habitat connectivity for Indochinese tigers (Panthera tigris) in Thailand. We quantified suitable habitat and dispersal corridors based an ensemble species distribution model that included prey distributions, primary productivity, and abiotic variables and was based on camera-trap data from 1996 to 2013 in 15 protected areas. We employed graph theory to evaluate the relative importance of habitat patches and dispersal corridors to the overall connectivity network. We found that tiger occurrence models with and without prey distributions performed well (Area Under the Curve: 0.932-0.954). However, inclusion of prey distributions significantly improved model performance (P < 0.001). Protected areas with tigers at the time of our surveys were highly isolated with high resistance to movement within the dispersal corridors, and four of them have lost their tiger populations since. Potential habitat patches outside of protected areas were also mostly isolated, but it was encouraging to find that there is ample potential habitat that tigers are not occupying. The Huai Kha Kaeng - ThungYai habitat patch and Kaeng Krachan dispersal corridor were the most important for overall habitat connectivity. Generally, integrating prey distributions into assessments of connectivity is a promising approach that can be widely applied to predict species occurrence and delineate dispersal corridors, thereby supporting conservation planning of tigers and other large carnivores.

TI  - Restoring a Degraded, Sentinel New England Salt Marsh to Mid-20th Century Conditions (Flax Pond, New York, USA)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flax Pond, located between Crane Neck and Old Field Point on the north shore of Long Island, is designated as a Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and as a Scenic Recreational Reserve by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The pond's tidal prism has been reduced about 18% over the past half-century as its inlet has shoaled and its tidal range diminished 33%, 0.6 m, all in low water. Reduced flushing has led to loss of wetlands, reduced water quality, increased pond salinity, and nighttime summertime hypoxia with concomitant reduction in pH. Historic charts, topographic surveys, and vertical aerial photographs were used to study the evolution of the pond's inlet from Long Island Sound (LIS). Tide, tidal current, and water quality observations were made and/or historical measurements were acquired at these locations: the pond's inlet, a proposed seawater intake for the Flax Pond Marine Laboratory, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water quality station some 650 m into the pond. The flux of water through the inlet from LIS and the change in bed slope through the pond inlet were measured. USGS data within the pond were used to determine when hypoxic conditions are likely to occur: an increase in bottom-water salinity of 2.1 in 9 years and in the elevation of low water of 18 mm y(-1) from 2008-14. The environmental benefits of reconfiguring the inlet to increase the tidal prism to that of the 1970s were explored. This would reduce the existing flushing time by more than 50%. The design of the cross-sectional shape for the inlet is based on this tidal prism and a compatible depth entering LIS; it should stabilize the inlet opening and improve much needed pond flushing.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Land Surface Temperature over Heterogeneous Regions Using Random Forest Regression Considering Spatial Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the crucial parameters in the physical processes of the Earth. Acquiring LST images with high spatial and temporal resolutions is currently difficult because of the technical restriction of satellite thermal infrared sensors. Downscaling LST from coarse to fine spatial resolution is an effective means to alleviate this problem. A spatial random forest downscaling LST method (SRFD) was proposed in this study. Abundant predictor variables-including land surface reflection data, remote sensing spectral indexes, terrain factors, and land cover type data-were considered and applied for feature selection in SRFD. Moreover, the shortcoming of only focusing on information from point-to-point in previous statistics-based downscaling methods was supplemented by adding the spatial feature of LST. SRFD was applied to three different heterogeneous regions and compared with the results from three classical or excellent methods, including thermal image sharpening algorithm, multifactor geographically weighted regression, and random forest downscaling method. Results show that SRFD outperforms other methods in vision and statistics due to the benefits from the supplement of the LST spatial feature. Specifically, compared with RFD, the second-best method, the downscaling results of SRFD are 10% to 24% lower in root-mean-square error, 5% to 20% higher in the coefficient of determination, 11% to 25% lower in mean absolute error, and 4% to 17% higher in structural similarity index measure. Hence, we conclude that SRFD will be a promising LST downscaling method.

TI  - A recurrent curve matching classification method integrating within-object spectral variability and between-object spatial association
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based image analysis (OBIA), which has been commonly used for land cover and land use classification, may encounter challenges when satellite images' spatial resolution achieves at the sub-meter level. An image object may exhibit spectral heterogeneity, causing traditional object-level statistical measures such as mean values of the pixels in an object not suited to represent the feature of the object. Additionally, an image object may have strong spatial association with its surroundings. Traditional OBIA only considers spatial features of individual object, but ignoring spatial arrangement or spatial association between objects. This paper proposes a new OBIA method by integrating within-object spectral variability and between-object spatial association. The within-object spectral variability is captured by the histograms of the pixels in an object across multispectral bands to reflect the heterogeneity of their pixel values. Based on this, the initial classification result is obtained using non-parametric curve matching methods. Then, the between-object spatial association is represented by curves derived from the frequency of pairwise classes in four main directions, also in the form of curves. The curves now composed of both the histograms of spectral feature and the class pair frequency of spatial feature are then fused for another curve matching based classification. This recurrent process is repeated and the spatial association is recaptured from the previous classification result at each iteration until a stopping criterion is satisfied. The curve matching classification method based on histograms of spectral feature is superior to traditional OBIA based on only object-level statistical measures since it fully characterizes spectral variability in the objects. The between-object spatial association works as a spatial filter that considers spatial arrangement of classes in a neighborhood. The developed method is especially suitable for classifying high spatial resolution (HSR) images with land cover/land use classes in typical urban areas.

TI  - Improving the spatiotemporal fusion accuracy of fractional vegetation cover in agricultural regions by combining vegetation growth models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion has provided a feasible way to generate fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, when the currently available spatiotemporal fusion methods are applied over agricultural regions, they usually underestimate high FVC values at the peak vegetation growth stage with medium FVC values as base data. This mainly results from inconsistencies in the temporal variations between fine- and coarse-resolution data if substantial temporal changes occur in vegetation. Therefore, a Spatial and Temporal Fusion method combining with Vegetation Growth Models (STF-VGM) was proposed to address this problem in this study, which incorporates vegetation growth models into the fusion process. Unlike other spatiotemporal fusion methods that mainly rely on changes in coarse-resolution data for prediction, STF-VGM fully utilizes available coarse- and fine-resolution time series data, including uncontaminated information in cloud/cloud shadow contaminated images. By establishing vegetation growth models with time series data, a conversion relationship between coarse- and fine-resolution FVC that changes along with the nonlinear vegetation change process can be extracted. STF-VGM makes prediction based on this variable relationship. A typical agricultural region located in the North China Plain was selected as the study area. The validation results indicated that the prediction accuracy for high FVC values was significantly improved using STF-VGM compared to the commonly used Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) methods (STF-VGM: coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.9491, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.0650, average difference (AD) = -0.0092; ESTARFM: R2 = 0.9341, RMSE = 0.1127, AD = -0.0631; FSDAF: R2 = 0.9224, RMSE = 0.1110, AD = -0.0599). The satisfactory performance of STF-VGM was also achieved in predicting FVC values at other vegetation growth stages (early growth stage: R2 = 0.8277, RMSE = 0.0440, AD = 0.0027; rapid growth stage: R2 = 0.9183, RMSE = 0.0844, AD = 0.0500). In addition, STF-VGM also has the potential to improve the spatiotemporal fusion accuracy of other vegetation parameters and vegetation indices, which will be evaluated in the future.

TI  - A PSNR Review of ESTARFM Cloud Removal Method with Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 Combination
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing images with high spatial and temporal resolution (HSHT) for GIS land use monitoring are crucial data sources. When trying to get HSHT resolution images, cloud cover is a typical problem. The effects of cloud cover reduction using the ESTARFM, one of spatiotemporal image fusion technique, is examined in this study. By merging two satellite photos of low-resolution and medium-resolution images, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Method (ESTARFM), predicts the reflectance value of the cloud cover region. ESTARFM, on the other hand, employs both medium and high-resolution satellite pictures in this study. Using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8, the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) statistical methods are then utilized to evaluate the ESTARFM. The PSNR explain ESTARFM cloud removal performance by comparing the level of similarity of the reference image with the reconstructed image. In remote sensing, this hypothesis was established to get high-quality HSHT pictures. Based on this study, Landsat 8 images that have been cloud removed with ESTARFM may be classed as good. The PSNR value of 21.8 to 26 backs this up, and the ESTARFM result seems good on visual examination.

TI  - Recommendations for respiratory syncytial virus surveillance at the national level
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalisations among young children and is globally responsible for many deaths in young children, especially in infants aged <6 months. Furthermore, RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory disease and hospitalisation among older adults. The development of new candidate vaccines and monoclonal antibodies highlights the need for reliable surveillance of RSV. In the European Union (EU), no up-to-date general recommendations on RSV surveillance are currently available. Based on outcomes of a workshop with 29 European experts in the field of RSV virology, epidemiology and public health, we provide recommendations for developing a feasible and sustainable national surveillance strategy for RSV that will enable harmonisation and data comparison at the European level. We discuss three surveillance components: active sentinel community surveillance, active sentinel hospital surveillance and passive laboratory surveillance, using the EU acute respiratory infection and World Health Organization (WHO) extended severe acute respiratory infection case definitions. Furthermore, we recommend the use of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR-based assays as the standard detection method for RSV and virus genetic characterisation, if possible, to monitor genetic evolution. These guidelines provide a basis for good quality, feasible and affordable surveillance of RSV. Harmonisation of surveillance standards at the European and global level will contribute to the wider availability of national level RSV surveillance data for regional and global analysis, and for estimation of RSV burden and the impact of future immunisation programmes.

TI  - FLATSIM: The ForM@Ter LArge-Scale Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 InterferoMetry Service
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the ForM@Ter LArge-scale multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 InterferoMetry service (FLATSIM) is the massive processing of Sentinel-1 data using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) over large areas, i.e., greater than 250,000 km(2). It provides the French ForM@ter scientific community with automatically processed products using a state of the art processing chain based on a small baseline subset approach, namely the New Small Baseline (NSBAS). The service results from a collaboration between the scientific team that develops and maintains the NSBAS processing chain and the French Spatial Agency (CNES) that mirrors the Sentinel-1 data. The proximity to Sentinel-1 data, the NSBAS workflow, and the specific optimizations to make NSBAS processing massively parallel for the CNES high performance computing infrastructure ensures the efficiency of the chain, especially in terms of input and output, which is the key for the success of such a service. The FLATSIM service is made of a production module, a delivery module and a user access module. Products include interferograms, surface line of sight velocity, phase delay time series and auxiliary data. Numerous quality indicators are provided for an in-depth analysis of the quality and limits of the results. The first national call in 2020 for region of interest ended up with 8 regions spread over the world with scientific interests, including seismology, tectonics, volcano-tectonics, and hydrological cycle. To illustrate the FLATSIM capabilities, an analysis is shown here on two processed regions, the Afar region in Ethiopa, and the eastern border of the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - A novel spectral index for estimating fractional cover of non-photosynthetic vegetation using near-infrared bands of Sentinel satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) is an essential component in various vegetation-soil ecosystems. Both phenology and disturbance lead to a transition from photosynthetic vegetation to NPV and vice versa. Due to the similar spectral reflectance of NPV and bare soil (BS) in the visible-near infrared region (400-1000 nm), NPV and BS separation is relying on the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in most cases. The lignin and cellulose absorption feature is around 2100 nm, which is the most distinctive feature of NPV. However, the water absorption feature is much stronger in the SWIR, increasing the difficulty for NPV-BS separation when wet. Recently, Sentinel-2/3 satellites add more bands in the near infrared (NIR), which provide an extra opportunity for index building and application. Based on the difference captured by derivative spectra, a spectral index, NPV-Soil Separation Index (NSSI), is proposed to realize the separation using two NIR bands within 750-900 nm range in this study. Using spectra of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), NPV, and BS acquired from world-recognized spectral libraries, NSSI is built and validated as effective for lab-collected data. With the triangle method, one of the linear spectral unmixing methods, the fractional cover of PV, NPV, and BS can be estimated. Over a woodland study area, the fractional cover retrieved by cellulose absorption index (CAI) and NDVI combination of ZY1-02D AHSI hyperspectral image is 26.41%, 37.56%, 36.03% for PV, NPV, and BS in order. With the proposed NSSI-NDVI combination, the corresponding estimated fractional cover is 23.31%, 38.44%, 38.25% using Sentinel-2 MSI and 24.58%, 36.74%, and 38.68% using Sentinel-3 OLCI image. The comparable validation result confirms that the proposed NSSI is effective for NPV-BS separation. Moreover, the triangle method of NSSI-NDVI combination is applied on both grassland and cropland images to examine its feasibility on varied types of typical vegetation-soil ecosystems, and the well-built triangular space supports its feasibility. Relying on NIR bands, NSSI can avoid strong water absorption in the SWIR. Also, the feasibility of NSSI being used on multiple multispectral satellite sensors, especially the Sentinel series, makes continuous mapping for NPV over a large spatial scale possible.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Public emergencies often have an impact on the production and operation of enterprises. Timely and effective quantitative measurement of enterprises' offline resumption of work after public emergencies is conducive to the formulation and implementation of relevant policies. In this study, we analyze the level of work resumption after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-influenced Chinese Spring Festival in 2020 with night time lights remote sensing data and Baidu Migration data. The results are verified by official statistics and facts, which demonstrates that COVID-19 has seriously affected the resumption of work after the Spring Festival holiday. Since 10 February, work has been resuming in localities. By the end of March, the work resumption index of most cities exceeded 70% and even Shanghai, Nanjing and Suzhou had achieved complete resumption of work. Wuhan only started to resume work in the last week of March due to the more severe outbreak. Although the level of work resumption is gradually increasing in every area, the specific situation of resumption of work varies in different regions. The process of work resumption in coastal areas is faster, while the process is relatively slow in inland cities.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Pasture Degradation in the Highlands of the Kyrgyz Republic: Finer-Scale Analysis Reveals Complicating Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation in the highland pastures of the Kyrgyz Republic, a small country in Central Asia, has been reported in several studies relying on coarse spatial resolution imagery, primarily MODIS. We used the results of land surface phenology modeling at higher spatial resolution to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of phenometrics indicative of the seasonal peak in herbaceous vegetation. In particular, we explored whether proximity to villages was associated with substantial decreases in the seasonal peak values. We found that terrain features-elevation and aspect-modulated the strength of the influence of village proximity on the phenometrics. Moreover, using contrasting hotter/drier and cooler/wetter years, we discovered that the growing season weather can interact with aspect to attenuate the negative influences of dry conditions on seasonal peak values. As these multiple contingent and interactive factors that shape the land surface phenology of the highland pastures may be blurred and obscured in coarser spatial resolution imagery, we discuss some limitations with prior and recent studies of pasture degradation.

TI  - Prototyping a Generic Algorithm for Crop Parameter Retrieval across the Season Using Radiative Transfer Model Inversion and Sentinel-2 Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Sentinel-2 data were used for the retrieval of three key biophysical parameters of crops: leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and leaf water content (LWC) for dominant crop types in the Czech Republic, including winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare), winter rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp. napus), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), and corn (Zea mays subsp. Mays) in different stages of crop development. Artificial neural networks were applied in combination with an approach using look-up tables that is based on PROSAIL simulations to retrieve the biophysical properties tailored for each crop type. Crop-specific PROSAIL model optimization and validation were based upon a large dataset of in situ measurements collected in 2017 and 2018 in lowland of Central Bohemia region. For LCC and LAI, respectively, low relative root mean square error (rRMSE; 25%, 37%) was achieved. Additionally, a relatively strong correlation with in situ measurements (r = 0.80) was obtained for LAI. On the contrary, the results of the LWC parameter retrieval proved to be unsatisfactory. We have developed a generic tool for biophysical monitoring of agricultural crops based on the interpretation of Sentinel-2 satellite data by inversion of the radiation transfer model. The resulting crop condition maps can serve as precision agriculture inputs for selective fertilizer and irrigation application as well as for yield potential assessment.

T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic rise of human population growth and urban development, especially in developing countries, has led to a decline in the quality, fragmentation and isolation of habitats which support rare or endangered fauna species. New areas designed to protect such species and form corridors and networks to support populations are needed. Two rare species of Chinkara and Blanford's fox habitats in Isfahan Province are used to evaluate the optimal method to determine suitable habitat. Eight statistical methods, including four widely-used methods (SVM, Random Forest, GBM and MARS) and five new methods (XGBtree, XGBLinear, Treebag and SVMRadial) are evaluated in this study; to do so two Modis products and 19 worldclim parameters are applied. In addition, the ensemble of these methods was applied using gap analysis and areas with potential for protection were prioritized. Finally, minimum cost analysis was utilized to identify possible corridors between new areas and current protected areas. Results demonstrate that the eastern parts of Isfahan province have the highest potential for these two species, and because of the diverse habitats demands for these two species, the regions are able to support a large number of fauna and flora species.

TI  - Cluster and Redundancy Analyses of Taiwan Upstream Watersheds Based on Monthly 30 Years AVHRR NDVI3g Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study uses 30 years of the third generation of Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI3g monthly data from 1982 to 2012 to identify the natural clusters and important driving factors of the upstream watersheds in Taiwan through hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA), respectively. Subsequently, as a result of HCA, six clusters were identified based on the 30 years of monthly NDVI data, delineating unique NDVI characteristics of the upstream watersheds. Additionally, based on the RDA results, environmental factors, including precipitation, temperature, slope, and aspect, can explain approximately 52% of the NDVI variance over the entire time series. Among environmental factors, nine factors were identified significantly through RDA analysis for explaining NDVI variance: average slope, temperature, flat slope, northeast-facing slope, rainfall, east-facing slope, southeast-facing slope, west-facing slope, and northwest-facing slope, which reflect an intimate connection between climatic and orthographic factors with vegetation. Furthermore, the rainfall and temperature represent different variations in all scenarios and seasons. With consideration of the characteristics of the clusters and significant environmental factors, corresponding climate change adaptation strategies are proposed for each cluster under climate change scenarios. Thus, the results provide insight to assess the natural clustering of the upstream watersheds in Taiwan, benefitting future sustainable watershed management.

TI  - Field Validation of the Southern Rock Lobster Paralytic Shellfish Toxin Monitoring Program in Tasmania, Australia
T2  - MARINE DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) are found in the hepatopancreas of Southern Rock Lobster Jasus edwardsii from the east coast of Tasmania in association with blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Tasmania's rock lobster fishery is one of the state's most important wild capture fisheries, supporting a significant commercial industry (AUD 97M) and recreational fishing sector. A comprehensive 8 years of field data collected across multiple sites has allowed continued improvements to the risk management program protecting public health and market access for the Tasmanian lobster fishery. High variability was seen in toxin levels between individuals, sites, months, and years. The highest risk sites were those on the central east coast, with July to January identified as the most at-risk months. Relatively high uptake rates were observed (exponential rate of 2% per day), similar to filter-feeding mussels, and meant that lobster accumulated toxins quickly. Similarly, lobsters were relatively fast detoxifiers, losing up to 3% PST per day, following bloom demise. Mussel sentinel lines were effective in indicating a risk of elevated PST in lobster hepatopancreas, with annual baseline monitoring costing approximately 0.06% of the industry value. In addition, it was determined that if the mean hepatopancreas PST levels in five individual lobsters from a site were <0.22 mg STX equiv. kg(-1), there is a 97.5% probability that any lobster from that site would be below the bivalve maximum level of 0.8 mg STX equiv. kg(-1). The combination of using a sentinel species to identify risk areas and sampling five individual lobsters at a particular site, provides a cost-effective strategy for managing PST risk in the Tasmanian commercial lobster fishery.

TI  - Integration of Remote Sensing Data into a Composite Voxel Model for Environmental Performance Analysis of Terraced Vineyards in Tuscany, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding socio-ecological systems and the discovery, recovery and adaptation of land knowledge are key challenges for sustainable land use. The analysis of sustainable agricultural systems and practices, for instance, requires interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and coordinated data acquisition, data integration and analysis. However, datasets, which are acquired using remote sensing, geospatial analysis and simulation techniques, are often limited by narrow disciplinary boundaries and therefore fall short in enabling a holistic approach across multiple domains and scales. In this work, we demonstrate a new workflow for interdisciplinary data acquisition and integration, focusing on terraced vineyards in Tuscany, Italy. We used multi-modal data acquisition and performed data integration via a voxelised point cloud that we term a composite voxel model. The latter facilitates a multi-domain and multi-scale data-integrated approach for advancing the discovery and recovery of land knowledge. This approach enables integration, correlation and analysis of data pertaining to different domains and scales in a single data structure.

TI  - Differentiating Soils from Arable and Fallow Land Using Spectrometry
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyse soil system responses-in particular, the colours of soils resulting from different types of land use (arable land and residential areas) caused by the construction of an ancient boundary rampart near a multilayer monument dating from between prehistory and the Middle Ages within the boundaries of the Bosporus Kingdom (Eastern Crimea)-in an area of modern and ancient (4th-2nd centuries BC) land use (Northwestern Crimea). These differences are of interest because they offer the chance to decipher different types of ancient land use and systems of land surveying, incorporating data from colour aerial photographs obtained with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles. Soil samples displaying different types of anthropogenic transformation were taken from the ancient boundary ramparts and adjacent land. The soil colour coordinates in the CIE L*a*b system were measured with the help of an AvaSpec-2048 spectrometer. Differences in colour coordinates were analysed using analysis of variance (NPMANOVA) based on the permutation test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Mann-Whitney test, corrected according to multiple comparisons carried out as per the Bonferroni method. The results of this statistical analysis show that there are statistically significant differences in soil colour coordinates between samples collected on the ramparts and under various other types of land use. These differences are more pronounced in the samples characterised by the agrogenic transformation of soil. This makes it possible to use remote sensing data to detect traces of ancient boundary ramparts, even if the ramparts are partially destroyed by ploughing.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series for Slangbos Mapping in the Free State Province, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing woody cover and overgrazing in semi-arid ecosystems are known to be the major factors driving land degradation. This study focuses on mapping the distribution of the slangbos shrub (Seriphium plumosum) in a test region in the Free State Province of South Africa. The goal of this study is to monitor the slangbos encroachment on cultivated land by synergistically combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) Earth observation information. Both optical and radar satellite data are sensitive to different vegetation properties and surface scattering or reflection mechanisms caused by the specific sensor characteristics. We used a supervised random forest classification to predict slangbos encroachment for each individual crop year between 2015 and 2020. Training data were derived based on expert knowledge and in situ information from the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD). We found that the Sentinel-1 VH (cross-polarization) and Sentinel-2 SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) time series information have the highest importance for the random forest classifier among all input parameters. The modelling results confirm the in situ observations that pastures are most affected by slangbos encroachment. The estimation of the model accuracy was accomplished via spatial cross-validation (SpCV) and resulted in a classification precision of around 80% for the slangbos class within each time step.

TI  - Comparisons of Adaptations in Grounded Theory and Phenomenology: Selecting the Specific Qualitative Research Methodology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The most widely used qualitative research methodologies are grounded theory and phenomenology. Both methodologies have expanded over time to several adaptations aligning with different paradigms, complex philosophical assumptions, and varying methodological strategies. Novice researchers either mistakenly mix the strategies of both methodologies or blend specific assumptions of methodologies' different adaptations. Choosing the appropriate methodology and the specific adaptation in line with research inquiry and congruent with the researchers' worldview is crucial in undertaking rigorous qualitative study. To date, there is limited literature that compared and contrasted the varying philosophical underpinnings of the two methodologies' different adaptations. The purpose of this methodological paper is to provide a general overview of the two methodologies' different adaptations to illustrate how they differ in approach. By immersing into the origins, philosophical assumptions, and utility of the two methodologies' adaptations, novice researchers will develop a general overview of the foundations that support those specific adaptations. Finally, the considerations in choosing a specific adaptation of a methodology are discussed and applied by underpinning a research question on the care experiences of patients in the Accountable Care Unit. Thus, this methodological paper may assist novice researchers in deciding which specific adaptation of the two methodologies is the appropriate qualitative methodology for their research.

TI  - Satellite-Based Human Settlement Datasets Inadequately Detect Refugee Settlements: A Critical Assessment at Thirty Refugee Settlements in Uganda
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based broad-scale (i.e., global and continental) human settlement data are essential for diverse applications spanning climate hazard mitigation, sustainable development monitoring, spatial epidemiology and demographic modeling. Many human settlement products report exceptional detection accuracies above 85%, but there is a substantial blind spot in that product validation typically focuses on large urban areas and excludes rural, small-scale settlements that are home to 3.4 billion people around the world. In this study, we make use of a data-rich sample of 30 refugee settlements in Uganda to assess the small-scale settlement detection by four human settlement products, namely, Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development settlement extent data (GRID3-SE), Global Human Settlements Built-Up Sentinel-2 (GHS-BUILT-S2), High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) and World Settlement Footprint (WSF). We measured each product's areal coverage within refugee settlement boundaries, assessed detection of 317,416 building footprints and examined spatial agreement among products. For settlements established before 2016, products had low median probability of detection and F1-score of 0.26 and 0.24, respectively, a high median false alarm rate of 0.59 and tended to only agree in regions with the highest building density. Individually, GRID3-SE offered more than five-fold the coverage of other products, GHS-BUILT-S2 underestimated the building footprint area by a median 50% and HRSL slightly underestimated the footprint area by a median 7%, while WSF entirely overlooked 8 of the 30 study refugee settlements. The variable rates of coverage and detection partly result from GRID3-SE and HRSL being based on much higher resolution imagery, compared to GHS-BUILT-S2 and WSF. Earlier established settlements were generally better detected than recently established settlements, showing that the timing of satellite image acquisition with respect to refugee settlement establishment also influenced detection results. Nonetheless, settlements established in the 1960s and 1980s were inconsistently detected by settlement products. These findings show that human settlement products have far to go in capturing small-scale refugee settlements and would benefit from incorporating refugee settlements in training and validating human settlement detection approaches.

TI  - Mapping Wetland Burned Area from Sentinel-2 across the Southeastern United States and Its Contributions Relative to Landsat-8 (2016-2019)
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed fires and wildfires are common in wetland ecosystems across the Southeastern United States. However, the wetland burned area has been chronically underestimated across the region due to (1) spectral confusion between open water and burned area, (2) rapid post-fire vegetation regrowth, and (3) high annual precipitation limiting clear-sky satellite observations. We developed a machine learning algorithm specifically for burned area in wetlands, and applied the algorithm to the Sentinel-2 archive (2016-2019) across the Southeastern US (>290,000 km(2)). Combining Landsat-8 imagery with Sentinel-2 increased the annual clear-sky observation count from 17 to 46 in 2016 and from 16 to 78 in 2019. When validated with WorldView imagery, the Sentinel-2 burned area had a 29% and 30% omission and commission rates of error for burned area, respectively, compared to the US Geological Survey Landsat-8 Burned Area Product (L8 BA), which had a 47% and 8% omission and commission rate of error, respectively. The Sentinel-2 algorithm and the L8 BA mapped burned area within 78% and 60% of wetland fire perimeters (n = 555) compiled from state and federal agencies, respectively. This analysis demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 to support efforts to track the burned area, especially across challenging ecosystem types, such as wetlands.

TI  - Reviewing the Potential of Sentinel-2 in Assessing the Drought
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper systematically reviews the potential of the Sentinel-2 (A and B) in assessing drought. Research findings, including the IPCC reports, highlighted the increasing trend in drought over the decades and the need for a better understanding and assessment of this phenomenon. Continuous monitoring of the Earth's surface is an efficient method for predicting and identifying the early warnings of drought, which enables us to prepare and plan the mitigation procedures. Considering the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics, the freely available Sentinel-2 data products are a promising option in this area of research, compared to Landsat and MODIS. This paper evaluates the recent developments in this field induced by the launch of Sentinel-2, as well as the comparison with other existing data products. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 in assessing drought through vegetation characteristics, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, surface water including wetland, and land use and land cover analysis. Furthermore, this review also addresses and compares various data fusion methods and downscaling methods applied to Sentinel-2 for retrieving the major bio-geophysical variables used in the analysis of drought. Additionally, the limitations of Sentinel-2 in its direct applicability to drought studies are also evaluated.

TI  - Response of Subdaily L-Band Backscatter to Internal and Surface Canopy Water Dynamics
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest developments in radar mission concepts suggest that subdaily synthetic aperture radar will become available in the next decades. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the potential value of subdaily spaceborne radar for monitoring vegetation water dynamics, which is essential to understand the role of vegetation in the climate system. In particular, we aimed to quantify fluctuations of internal and surface canopy water (SCW) and understand their effect on subdaily patterns of L-band backscatter. An intensive field campaign was conducted in north-central Florida, USA, in 2018. A truck-mounted polarimetric L-band scatterometer was used to scan a sweet corn field multiple times per day, from sowing to harvest. SCW (dew, interception), soil moisture, and plant and soil hydraulics were monitored every 15 min. In addition, regular destructive sampling was conducted to measure seasonal and diurnal variations of internal vegetation water content. The results showed that backscatter was sensitive to both transient rainfall interception events, and slower daily cycles of internal canopy water and dew. On late-season days without rainfall, maximum diurnal backscatter variations of >2 dB due to internal and SCW were observed in all polarizations. These results demonstrate a potentially valuable application for the next generation of spaceborne radar missions.

TI  - Data-Driven Interpolation of Sea Surface Suspended Concentrations Derived from Ocean Colour Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to complex natural and anthropogenic interconnected forcings, the dynamics of suspended sediments within the ocean water column remains difficult to understand and monitor. Numerical models still lack capabilities to account for the variabilities depicted by in situ and satellite-derived datasets. Besides, the irregular space-time sampling associated with satellite sensors make crucial the development of efficient interpolation methods. Optimal Interpolation (OI) remains the state-of-the-art approach for most operational products. Due to the large increase of both in situ and satellite measurements more and more available information is coming from in situ and satellite measurements, as well as from simulation models. The emergence of data-driven schemes as possibly relevant alternatives with increased capabilities to recover finer-scale processes. In this study, we investigate and benchmark three state-of-the-art data-driven schemes, namely an EOF-based technique, an analog data assimilation scheme, and a neural network approach, with an OI scheme. We rely on an Observing System Simulation Experiment based on high-resolution numerical simulations and simulated satellite observations using real satellite sampling patterns. The neural network approach, which relies on variational data assimilation formulation for the interpolation problem, clearly outperforms both the OI and the other data-driven schemes, both in terms of reconstruction performance and of a greater ability to recover high-frequency events. We further discuss how these results could transfer to real data, as well as to other problems beyond interpolation issues, especially short-term forecasting problems from partial satellite observations.

TI  - Role of physical oceanography parameters in ocean's biological response with the passage of cyclone <i>Titli</i> in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Titli was the cataclysmic storm to afflict Indian coast during 2018. Tropical cyclones may inflate nutrients on the surface layer of the ocean by entrainment and mixing, as a result, the upper oligotrophic and euphotic layers may be recharged with rich nutrients resulting in triggering phytoplankton blooms and significant increase in primary production. The biological response using the chlorophyll concentration from Oceansat-2 OCM and the Net Primary Productivity from MODIS-A to this cyclone and its relation with the cyclone intensity has been studied. Role of physical oceanography parameters has been studied using multiple satellite-derived parameters like SST, TCHP, SLA, Ekman pumping velocity, wind stress and wind vectors and eddies during the passage of cyclone Titli. The results showed an increase in the surface chlorophyll concentration from 0.08 (before) to 0.32 mg m(-3) (after), whereas NPP enhanced from 457 to 1313 mgC m(-2) day(-1) with an SST drop of similar to 2.58 degrees C (30.25 degrees-27.67 degrees C). The study confirms that the physical parameters are the key components that influence the biological response in addition to the cyclone intensity.

TI  - Thermal regime of the Dnipro Reservoirs
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the results of regular monitoring and remote sensing data the patterns of water temperature of the reservoirs cascade on the Dnipro River were identified. A characteristic feature of the thermal regime of the Dnipro Cascade has been the water temperature increase over the past decades. In the period 1977-2020 the water temperature in summer increased by 0.74 degrees C decade(-1), and during May-October by 0.65 degrees C decade(-1). An important factor influencing the thermal regime of the reservoirs is the influence of those ones, located upstream. Water from them is discharged from the lower layer, where the processes of heating and cooling are very slow. This has a significant influence on the water temperature of downstream reservoirs, especially on their upper part. The water temperature in this part during spring and summer seasons is lower compared to natural conditions. In autumn it is higher. The temperature of water also depends on the latitude: it rises in the reservoirs located both downstream and to the south. Another important factor influencing the water temperature is the wind, which can change the temperature in the surface layer by 5-6 degrees C. Water temperature also depends on the intensity of algae bloom - it is higher in the spots of a large bloom.

TI  - Positive response of tree productivity to warming is reversed by increased tree density at the Arctic tundra-taiga ecotone
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition zone between the northern boreal forest and the Arctic tundra, known as the tundra-taiga ecotone (TTE) has undergone rapid warming in recent decades. In response to this warming, tree density, growth, and stand productivity are expected to increase. Increases in tree density have the potential to negate the positive impacts of warming on tree growth through a reduction in the active layer and an increase in competitive interactions. We assessed the effects of tree density on tree growth and climate-growth responses of Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) and on trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the TTE of Northeast Siberia. We examined 19 mature forest stands that all established after a fire in 1940 and ranged in tree density from 300 to 37 000 stems.ha(-1). High-density stands with shallow active layers had lower tree growth, higher stand productivity, and more negative growth responses to growing season temperatures compared with low-density stands with deep active layers. Variation in stand productivity across the density gradient was not captured by Landsat-derived NDVI, but NDVI did capture annual variations in stand productivity. Our results suggest that the expected increases in tree density following fires at the TTE may effectively limit tree growth and that NDVI is unlikely to capture increasing productivity associated with changes in tree density.

TI  - Data Quality Evaluation of Sentinel-1 and GF-3 SAR for Wind Field Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important means to observe the sea surface wind field. Sentinel-1 and GF-3 are located on orbit SAR satellites, but the SAR data quality of these two satellites has not been evaluated and compared at present. This paper mainly studies the data quality of Sentinel-1 and GF-3 SAR satellites used in wind field inversion. In this study, Sentinel-1 SAR data and GF-3 SAR data located in Malacca Strait, Hormuz Strait and the east and west coasts of the United States are selected to invert wind fields using the C-band model 5.N (CMOD5.N). Compared with reanalysis data called ERA5, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the Sentinel-1 inversion results is 1.66 m/s, 1.37 m/s and 1.49 m/s in three intervals of 0 similar to 5 m/s, 5 similar to 10 m/s and above 10 m/s, respectively; the RMSE of GF-3 inversion results is 1.63 m/s, 1.45 m/s and 1.87 m/s in three intervals of 0 similar to 5 m/s, 5 similar to 10 m/s and above 10 m/s, respectively. Based on the data of Sentinel-1 and GF-3 located on the east and west coasts of the United States, CMOD5.N is used to invert the wind field. Compared with the buoy data, the RMSE of the Sentinel-1 inversion results is 1.20 m/s, and the RMSE of the GF-3 inversion results is 1.48 m/s. The results show that both Sentinel-1 SAR data and GF-3 SAR data are suitable for wind field inversion, but the wind field inverted by Sentinel-1 SAR data is slightly better than GF-3 SAR data. When applied to wind field inversion, the data quality of Sentinel-1 SAR is slightly better than the data quality of GF-3 SAR. The SAR data quality of GF-3 has achieved a world-leading level.

TI  - Guaranteed Robust Tensor Completion via *<i><sub>L</sub></i>-SVD with Applications to Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper conducts a rigorous analysis for the problem of robust tensor completion, which aims at recovering an unknown three-way tensor from incomplete observations corrupted by gross sparse outliers and small dense noises simultaneously due to various reasons such as sensor dead pixels, communication loss, electromagnetic interferences, cloud shadows, etc. To estimate the underlying tensor, a new penalized least squares estimator is first formulated by exploiting the low rankness of the signal tensor within the framework of tensor *L-Singular Value Decomposition (*L-SVD) and leveraging the sparse structure of the outlier tensor. Then, an algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is designed to compute the estimator in an efficient way. Statistically, the non-asymptotic upper bound on the estimation error is established and further proved to be optimal (up to a log factor) in a minimax sense. Simulation studies on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed error bound can predict the scaling behavior of the estimation error with problem parameters (i.e., tubal rank of the underlying tensor, sparsity of the outliers, and the number of uncorrupted observations). Both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are evaluated through experiments for robust completion on seven different types of remote sensing data.

TI  - Transportation Development, Spatiotemporal Convergence, and Urban Land Use: Study of the Opening of High-Speed Rails in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of high-speed rail (HSR) has accelerated urbanization of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). However, the impacts of HSR opening, opening time of HSR, and heterogeneity effects of HSR stations' characteristics on urban land use have not been well studied. Based on the land-use remote sensing data of YRD for 1990-2015, this study analyzes the causal effect of HSR opening on land-use change by applying the difference-in-differences model (DID). We find that the HSR opening has a significantly positive effect on the expansion of urban space and other construction land but accelerates the loss of agricultural land. Furthermore, the impact of HSR on urban land use is cumulative, and the opening time of HSR affects the speed of urban land use change. The longer the HSR opening time, the faster the change in urban land use. Moreover, the issue of the heterogeneity effects of HSR station characteristics on urban spatial expansion is also an important one. The results show that existing stations have a greater impact on urban spatial expansion.

TI  - ADS-Net:An Attention-Based deeply supervised network for remote sensing image change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection technology is an important key to analyze remote sensing data and is of great significance for accurate comprehension of the earth's surface changes. With the continuous development and progress of deep learning technology, fully convolutional neural networks are applied gradually in remote sensing change detection tasks. The present methods mainly encounter the problems of simple network structure, poor detection of small change areas, and poor robustness since they cannot completely obtain the relationships and differences between the features of bi-temporal images. To solve such problems, we propose an attention mechanism-based deep supervision network (ADS-Net) for the change detection of bi-temporal remote sensing images. First, an encoding-decoding full convolutional network is designed with a dual-stream structure. Various level features of bi-temporal images are extracted in the encoding stage, then in the decoding stage, feature maps of different levels are inserted into a deep supervision network with different branches to reconstruct the change map. Ultimately, to obtain the final change detection map, the prediction results of each branch in the deep supervision network are fused with various weights. To highlight the characteristics of change, we propose an adaptive attention mechanism combining spatial and channel features to capture the relationship of different scale changes and achieve more accurate change detection. ADS-Net has been tested on the LEVIR-CD and SVCD datasets of challenging remote sensing image change detection. The results of quantitative analysis and qualitative comparison indicate that the ADS-Net method comprises better effectiveness and robustness compared to the other state-of-the-art change detection methods.

TI  - Rice Yield Estimation Based on Vegetation Index and Florescence Spectral Information from UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice floret number per unit area as one of the key yield structure parameters is directly related to the final yield of rice. Previous studies paid little attention to the effect of the variations in vegetation indices (VIs) caused by rice flowering on rice yield estimation. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with hyperspectral cameras can provide high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data about the rice canopy, providing possibilities for flowering monitoring. In this study, two consecutive years of rice field experiments were conducted to explore the performance of florescence spectral information in improving the accuracy of VIs-based models for yield estimates. First, the florescence ratio reflectance and florescence difference reflectance, as well as their first derivative reflectance, were defined and then their correlations with rice yield were evaluated. It was found that the florescence spectral information at the seventh day of rice flowering showed the highest correlation with the yield. The sensitive bands to yield were centered at 590 nm, 690 nm and 736 nm-748 nm, 760 nm-768 nm for the first derivative florescence difference reflectance, and 704 nm-760 nm for the first derivative florescence ratio reflectance. The florescence ratio index (FRI) and florescence difference index (FDI) were developed and their abilities to improve the estimation accuracy of models basing on vegetation indices at single-, two- and three-growth stages were tested. With the introduction of florescence spectral information, the single-growth VI-based model produced the most obvious improvement in estimation accuracy, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.748 to 0.799, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) decreasing by 11.8% and 10.7%, respectively. Optimized by flowering information, the two-growth stage VIs-based model gave the best performance (R-2 = 0.869, MAPE = 3.98%, RMSE = 396.02 kg/ha). These results showed that introducing florescence spectral information at the flowering stage into conventional VIs-based yield estimation models is helpful in improving rice yield estimation accuracy. The usefulness of florescence spectral information for yield estimation provides a new idea for the further development and improvement of the crop yield estimation method.

TI  - A Comparison of the Different Stages of Dust Events over Beijing in March 2021: The Effects of the Vertical Structure on Near-Surface Particle Concentration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust is of great importance to climate change, air quality, and human health. In this study, multisource data, including the reanalysis data and remote sensing data, were used to compare the three dust events that occurred in the March of 2021 over Beijing and reveal the effects of atmospheric vertical structure on near-surface dust concentration. The combined effect of the Mongolian cyclone and a wide persistent cold-front induced two events (E1: from March 15 to 16 and E3: from March 28 to 29). E1 was more intense, more extensive, and longer-lasting than E3 due to the combination of the stronger Mongolian cyclone, slower high/cold surface pressure, and the low-level jet. However, under the appropriate configurations of temperature and pressure fields between high and low altitudes, weak updrafts were still induced and could elevate dust up to 850 hPa, as occurred during E2 on March 22 and 23. The dust emission was inferior to E1 and E3, which contributes to the low dust concentration near the surface in E2. On the other hand, the downdraft strength directly affected both the vertical distribution of dust and the concentration of surface particles. There was a strong temporal consistency between the occurrence of the downdraft and the dust touchdown. In E1, the continuous strong downdraft caused the maximum dust concentration to be above 4000 mu g/m(3) at around 200 m. In contrast, the maximum height of the dust mass concentration in E3 occurred at about 800 m due to the transient downdraft, which weakened its effect on surface visibility. Besides, the weak vertical motion in E2 caused most of the dust to become suspended in the air. Overall, the large dust emission resulted from active updrafts in the source region, and the lengthy strong downdrafts led to the ultrahigh particle concentration near the surface.

TI  - Modeling tree canopy height using machine learning over mixed vegetation landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the random forest algorithm has been widely applied to remotely sensed data to predict characteristics of forests, such as tree canopy height, the effect of spatial non-stationarity in the modeling process is oftentimes neglected. Previous studies have proposed methods to address the spatial variance at local scales, but few have explored the spatial autocorrelation pattern of residuals in modeling tree canopy height or investigated the relationship between canopy height and model performance. By combining Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Landsat datasets, we used spatially-weighted geographical random forest (GRF) and traditional random forest (TRF) methods to predict tree canopy height in a mixed dry forest woodland in complex mountainous terrain. Comparisons between TRF and GRF models show that the latter can lower predefined extreme residuals, and thus make the model performance relatively stronger. Moreover, the relationship between model performance and degree of variation of true canopy height can vary considerably within different height quantiles. Both models are likely to present underestimates and overestimates when the corresponding tree canopy heights are high ( 95% quantile) and low (<median), respectively. This study provides a critical insight into the relationship between tree canopy height and predictive abilities of random forest models when taking account of spatial non-stationarity. Conclusions indicate that a trade-off approach based on the actual need of project should be taken when selecting an optimal model integrating both local and global effects in modeling attributes such as canopy height from remotely sensed data.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is the most important composition part of land ecological system and is sensitive to the change of global climate. The characteristic of nearly 37a temporal and spatial evolution of NDVI in China's seasonal freezing-thawing area was studied focusing on the target of China's seasonal freeze-thawing area, utilizing methods of GIS spatial analysis and mathematical statistics and based on the dataset of AVHRR GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI during 1982 to 2018. It showed that nearly 37a NDVI in China's seasonal freezing-thawing area fluctuated with an increasing trend in the range of 5.292 similar to 6.635. Besides, the coverage degree of vegetation increased dramatically. Sandy land developed from the direction of desertification to oasisization. This work provides scientific evidence for the sandy land ecological evaluation of China's seasonal freezing-thawing area and regional sustainable development.

TI  - Potential Impacts of Assimilating Every-10-Minute Himawari-8 Satellite Radiance with the POD-4DEnVar Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite provides continuous observations every 10 min. This study investigates the assimilation of every-10min radiance from the AHI with the POD-4DEnVar method. Cloud detection is conducted in the AHI quality control procedure to remove cloudy and precipitation-affected observations. Historical samples and physical ensembles are combined to construct four-dimensional ensembles according to the observed frequency of the Himawari-8 satellite. The purpose of this study was to test the potential impacts of assimilating high temporal resolution observations with POD-4DEnVar in a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system. Two parallel experiments were performed with and without Himawari-8 radiance assimilation during the entire month of July 2020. The results of the experiment with radiance assimilation show that it improves the analysis and forecast accuracy of geopotential, horizontal wind field and relative humidity compared to the experiment without radiance assimilation. Moreover, the equitable threat score (ETS) of 24-h accumulated precipitation shows that assimilating Himawari-8 radiance improves the rainfall forecast accuracy. Improvements were found in the structure, amplitude and location of the precipitation. In addition, the ETS of hourly accumulated precipitation indicates that assimilating high temporal resolution Himawari-8 radiance can improve the prediction of rapidly developed rainfall. Overall, assimilating every-10-min AHI radiance from Himawari-8 with POD-4DEnVar has positive impacts on NWP.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes and Driving Factors of Cultivated Soil Organic Carbon in Northern China's Typical Agro-Pastoral Ecotone in the Last 30 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the spatiotemporal changes and driving factors of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China, we took Aohan banner, Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the study area, used the random forest (RF) method to predict the SOC from 1989 to 2018, and the geographic detector method (GDM) was applied to analyze quantitatively the natural and anthropogenic factors that are affecting Aohan banner. The results indicated that: (1) After adding the terrain factors, the R-2 and residual predictive deviation (RPD) of the RF model increased by 1.178 and 0.39%, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 1.42 g/kg and 1.05 g/kg, respectively; (2) The spatial distribution of SOC was higher in the south and lower in the north; the negative growth of SOC accounted for 55.923% of the total area, showing a trend of degradation; (3) Precipitation was the main driving factor of SOC spatial variation in the typical agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China, which was also affected by temperature, elevation, soil type and soil texture (p < 0.01). (4). Anthropogenic factors (carbon input and gross domestic product (GDP)) had a greater impact on SOC than did climate factors (temperature and precipitation), making anthropogenic factors the dominant factors affecting SOC temporal variation (p < 0.01). The results of this work constitute a basis for a regional assessment of the temporal evolution of organic carbon in the soil surface, which is a key tool for monitoring the sustainable development of agropastoral ecotones.

TI  - Real-Time Spatiotemporal Spectral Unmixing of MODIS Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed pixels are a ubiquitous problem in remote sensing images. Spectral unmixing has been used widely for mixed pixel analysis. However, up to now, most spectral unmixing methods require endmembers and cannot consider fully intraclass spectral variation. The recently proposed spatiotemporal spectral unmixing (STSU) method copes with the aforementioned problems through exploitation of the available temporal information. However, this method requires coarse-to-fine spatial image pairs both before and after the prediction time and is, thus, not suitable for important real-time applications (i.e., where the fine spatial resolution data after the prediction time are unknown). In this article, we proposed a real-time STSU (RSTSU) method for real-time monitoring. RSTSU requires only a single coarse-to-fine spatial resolution image pair before, and temporally closest to, the prediction time, coupled with the coarse image at the prediction time, to extract samples automatically to train a learning model. By fully incorporating the multiscale spatiotemporal information, the RSTSU method inherits the key advantages of STSU; it does not need endmembers and can account for intraclass spectral variation. More importantly, RSTSU is suitable for real-time analysis and, thus, facilitates the timely monitoring of land cover changes. The effectiveness of the method was validated by experiments on four Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. RSTSU utilizes and enriches the theory underpinning the advanced STSU method and enhances greatly the applicability of spectral unmixing for time-series data.

TI  - SpatialSpectral Radial Basis Function-Based Interpolation for Landsat ETM SLC-Off Image Gap Filling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scan-line corrector (SLC) of the Landsat 7 ETM+ failed permanently in 2003, resulting in about 22% unscanned gap pixels in the SLC-off images, affecting greatly the utility of the ETM+ data. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-spectral radial basis function (SSRBF)-based interpolation method to fill gaps in SLC-off images. Different from the conventional spatial-only radial basis function (RBF) that has been widely used in other domains, SSRBF also integrates a spectral RBF to increase the accuracy of gap filling. Concurrently, global linear histogram matching is applied to alleviate the impact of potentially large differences between the known and SLC-off images in feature space, which is demonstrated mathematically in this article. SSRBF fully exploits information in the data themselves and is user-friendly. The experimental results on five groups of data sets covering different heterogeneous regions show that the proposed SSRBF method is an effective solution to gap filling, and it can produce more accurate results than six popular benchmark methods.

TI  - Filling gaps in Landsat ETM plus SLC-off images with Sentinel-2 MSI images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 31, 2003, the scan-line corrector (SLC) of Landsat 7 ETM+ failed permanently. The resulting ETM+ SLCoff images contain 22% un-scanned gap pixels, thus, severely limiting their utility. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to fill gaps in SLC-off images by identifying a new source of auxiliary or known image. Specifically, Sentinel-2 MSI images are proposed as known images for gap filling, rather than the common strategy of using Landsat series data. The Sentinel-2 MSI data have the same map projection and similar band wavelengths as the Landsat 7 ETM+ data, and the Sentinel-2A and -2B MSI data together provide global coverage with a 5-day revisit period. The shorter revisit period of Sentinel-2 provides greater opportunities to acquire effective known images that are temporally close to the ETM+ SLC-off images for reliable gap filling. To render the Sentinel-2 MSI images suitable for gap filling, it is necessary to deal with their incompatible spatial resolutions relative to Landsat 7. Here, we used a downscaling-then-upscaling methodology involving Area-to-Point Regression Kriging (ATPRK) for the downscaling step. For the gap filling interpolation task we used a recently developed spatial-spectral radial basis function (SSRBF) method, which makes use of the available spectral as well as spatial information. Experiments were undertaken in which the SSRBF method was applied for gap filling using a range of different known images including Sentinel-2 MSI known images and Landsat 8 known images temporally close to and distant from the predicted image. The experimental results demonstrate that the Sentinel2 MSI known images produced by downscaling-then-upscaling are a valuable source of information for gap filling, especially when the existing Landsat series images (e.g., the OLI images) are temporally distant to the SLC-off images.

TI  - Evaluation on the Change Characteristics of Ecosystem Service Function in the Northern Xinjiang Based on Land Use Change
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the interannual changes in land use and the temporal and spatial characteristics of the ecosystem services value (ESV) can help to comprehensively and objectively understand the distribution of regional ecological patterns. The mountain-oasis-desert transition zone in the northern Tianshan Mountain region of Xinjiang, China, is a geographically unique area with a highly sensitive ecosystem. As a data source, the study uses Landsat TM images from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018 along with GIS-extracted data to calculate the dynamic degree of land use. As well, the spatial and temporal patterns of land use change and ESV are quantitatively analyzed by using the equivalent factor method, sensitivity index, and spatial correlation studies. The results reveal the following: (1) From 1990 to 2018, the land use changes in the northern Tianshans are relatively drastic, mainly due to the increase in cultivated land, grassland and construction land, and the decrease in forest land, water, and unused land. (2) The ESV increases and then decreases, for a total loss of about 271.63 x 10(8) yuan. The largest decrease is in forest value, and the largest increase (around 129.94%) is in construction land. (3) The spatial distribution pattern of ESV in the northern Tianshans is apparent, showing high in the north and southwest, and low in the central and southeast portions of the study area. Additionally, there is a visible spatial correlation and aggregation in ESV. The present research can provide theoretical support for the environmental protection of the ecologically vulnerable area of the northern Tianshans as well as for further construction across the region.

TI  - Retrieval of Outgoing Longwave Radiation from the Fengyun-3D Satellite and Its Climate Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite is a Chinese Earth observation satellite with high spectral resolution that can provide multi-spectral observations under all weather conditions. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is an important parameter in the earth radiation energy balance and can reflect changes in atmospheric circulation and convective activity in response to incoming solar radiation. To apply the OLR data of the FY-3D satellite (F_(OLR)) to weather and climate analyses, the traditional single-channel OLR inversion algorithm for the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite was used to calculate F_(OLR), and the difference between F_(OLR) and the OLR data of the NOAA 18 satellite (N_(OLR)) was analyzed. A correction algorithm was proposed to correct F_(OLR) to match N_(OLR); the spatiotemporal consistency of the corrected F_(OLR) and N_(OLR) was evaluated, and the two types of OLR data were used to analyze the onset of the South China Sea Summer Monsoon (SCSSM) and typhoon precipitation in China. The results showed that the corrected F_(OLR) and N_(OLR) were consistent in both temporal variation and spatial distribution and that the monitoring of the SCSSM and typhoon precipitation by the two types of OLR data was also in agreement, showing their equivalent quality. Finally, the N_(OLR) (2006-2019) and the corrected F_(OLR) (2020-present) were combined to form a long time series OLR dataset that was used in the Beijing Climate Center climate monitoring system in China to monitor abnormal changes in the global convective activity. This study can provide a reference method for future weather and climate applications of Chinese satellites.

TI  - Building Extraction in Multitemporal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using a Multifeature LSTM Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspired by recent promising developments by deep learning networks, this letter presents a novel approach based on a multifeature long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an optimal unit number for extracting buildings from multitemporal high-resolution optical satellite imagery. The algorithm first extracts specified multifeature data of buildings, including spectral, shape, texture, and indices from multitemporal high-resolution imagery. Next, a designed LSTM network architecture with an optimal unit number is trained using the multifeature data to extract buildings at the pixel level. The proposed network is compared with popular deep learning-based networks, including VGG, U-Net, and ResNet. Finally, postprocessing (e.g., morphological algorithm) is employed to optimize the classification results produced by deep learning. The approach is validated on a newly created data set using Gaofen-2 (GF-2) imagery that contains various buildings on a campus with different materials, shapes, sizes, heights, and directions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms current deep learning-based methods for building extraction and has a potential for practical applications.

TI  - Greening of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Its Response to Climate Variations along Elevation Gradients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is vital to the global climate change and ecological security of China. However, the impact of climate variation on the spatial pattern and zonal distribution of vegetation in the QTP remains unclear. Accordingly, we used multisource remote-sensing vegetation indices (GIMMS-LAI, GIMMS NDVI, GLOBMAP LAI, MODIS EVI, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS NIRv), climate data, a digital elevation model, and the moving window method to investigate the changes in vegetation greenness and its response to climate variations in the QTP from 2001 to 2016. Results showed that the vegetation was greening in the QTP, which might be attributed to the increases in temperature and radiation. By contrast, the browning of vegetation may be caused by drought. Notably, the spatial patterns of vegetation greenness and its variations were linearly correlated with climate at low altitudes, and vegetation greenness was non-linearly correlated with climate at high altitudes. The Northwestern QTP needs to be focused on in regard to positive and decreased VGEG (vegetation greenness along the elevation gradient). The significantly positive VGEG was up to (34.37 +/- 2.21) % of the QTP, which indicated a homogenization of vegetation greenness on elevation. This study will help us to understand the spatial distribution of vegetation greenness and VGEG in the QTP under global warming, and it will benefit ecological environment management, policymaking, and future climate and carbon sink (source) prediction.

TI  - Observational Evidence of Transient Lobe Reconnection Triggered by Sudden Northern Enhancement of IMF Bz
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In general, lobe reconnection occurs under northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz. However, what process can trigger lobe reconnection has not been fully understood. Using observations from SuperDARN radar and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, we found that (a) short-term sunward ionospheric flow bursts observed by SuperDARN poleward of the cusp showed one-to-one correspondent with the sudden increase of the IMF Bz, (b) the sunward flow bursts observed by SurperDARN were associated with sunward ion drifts identified from the DMSP satellite, and (c) a cusp auroral spot, together with an inverse ion energy dispersion, was observed in association with one of the flow bursts. We suggest that these observations provide evidence that the lobe reconnections can be triggered by a sudden increase of the IMF Bz component. What's more, we found that the reconnection signatures disappeared quickly after the IMF Bz enhancement being over, which indicates that the lobe reconnection triggered by the sudden increase of the IMF Bz is a transient process.

TI  - The Driving Influence of Multi-Dimensional Urbanization on PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in Africa: New Evidence from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data, 2000-2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa's PM2.5 pollution has become a security hazard, but the understanding of the varying effects of urbanization on driven mechanisms of PM2.5 concentrations under the rapid urbanization remains largely insufficient. Compared with the direct impact, the spillover effect of urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in adjacent regions was underestimated. Urbanization is highly multi-dimensional phenomenon and previous studies have rarely distinguished the different driving influence and interactions of multi-dimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in Africa. This study combined grid and administrative units to explore the spatio-temporal change, spatial dependence patterns, and evolution trend of PM2.5 concentrations and multi-dimensional urbanization in Africa. The differential influence and interaction effects of multi-dimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations under Africa's rapid urbanization was further analyzed. The results show that the positive spatial dependence of PM2.5 concentrations gradually increased over the study period 2000-2018. The areas with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 35 mu g/m(3) increased by 2.2%, and 36.78% of the African continent had an increasing trend in Theil-Sen index. Urbanization was found to be the main driving factor causing PM2.5 concentrations changes, and economic urbanization had a stronger influence on air quality than land urbanization or population urbanization. Compared with the direct effect, the spillover effect of urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in two adjacent regions was stronger, particularly in terms of economic urbanization. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations resulted from the interaction of multi-dimensional urbanization. The interaction of urbanization of any two different dimensions exhibited a nonlinear enhancement effect on PM2.5 concentrations. Given the differential impact of multi-dimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations inside and outside the region, this research provides support for the cross-regional joint control strategies of air pollution in Africa. The findings also indicate that PM2.5 pollution control should not only focus on urban economic development strategies but should be an optimized integration of multiple mitigation strategies, such as improving residents' lifestyles, optimizing land spatial structure, and upgrading the industrial structure.

TI  - Observation of Surface Displacement Associated with Rapid Urbanization and Land Creation in Lanzhou, Loess Plateau of China with Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lanzhou is one of the cities with the higher number of civil engineering projects for mountain excavation and city construction (MECC) on the China's Loess Plateau. As a result, the city is suffering from severe surface displacement, which is posing an increasing threat to the safety of the buildings. However, up to date, there is no comprehensive and high-precision displacement map to characterize the spatiotemporal surface displacement patterns in the city of Lanzhou. In this study, satellite-based observations, including optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing, were jointly used to characterize the landscape and topography changes in Lanzhou between 1997 and 2020 and investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the surface displacement associated with the large-scale MECC projects from 2015 December to March 2021. First, we retrieved the landscape changes in Lanzhou during the last 23 years using multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. Results illustrate that the landscape in local areas of Lanzhou has been dramatically changed as a result of the large-scale MECC projects and rapid urbanization. Then, we optimized the ordinary time series InSAR processing procedure by a "dynamic estimation of digital elevation model (DEM) errors" step added before displacement inversion to avoid the false displacement signals caused by DEM errors. The DEM errors and the high-precision surface displacement maps between December 2015 and March 2021 were calculated with 124 ascending and 122 descending Sentinel-1 SAR images. By combining estimated DEM errors and optical images, we detected and mapped historical MECC areas in the study area since 2000, retrieved the excavated and filling areas of the MECC projects, and evaluated their areas and volumes as well as the thickness of the filling loess. Results demonstrated that the area and volume of the excavated regions were basically equal to that of the filling regions, and the maximum thickness of the filling loess was greater than 90 m. Significant non-uniform surface displacements were observed in the filling regions of the MECC projects, with the maximum cumulative displacement lower than -40 cm. 2D displacement results revealed that surface displacement associated with the MECC project was dominated by settlements. From the correlation analysis between the displacement and the filling thickness, we found that the displacement magnitude was positively correlated with the thickness of the filling loess. This finding indicated that the compaction and consolidation process of the filling loess largely dominated the surface displacement. Our findings are of paramount importance for the urban planning and construction on the Loess Plateau region in which large-scale MECC projects are being developed.

TI  - The Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping for the Staging of Node-Negative Colon Cancer: Propensity Score and Mediation Analyses.
T2  - Annals of surgery open : perspectives of surgical history, education, and clinical approaches
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objectives: Mediation analysis to assess the protective impact of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping on prognosis and survival of patients with colon cancer through a more precise evaluation of the lymph node (LN) status.Background: Up to 20% of patients with node-negative colon cancer develop disease recurrence. Conventional histopathological LN examination may be limited in describing the real metastatic burden of LN.Methods: Data of 312 patients with stage I & II colon cancer was collected prospectively. Patients were either staged using intraoperative SLN mapping with multilevel sectioning and immunohistochemical staining of the SLN or conventional techniques. The value of the SLN mapping for the detection of truly node-negative patients was assessed using Cox regression and mediation analysis.Results: SLN mapping was performed in 143 patients. Disease recurrence was observed in 13 (9.1%) patients staged with SLN mapping and in 27 (16%) staged conventionally. Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 82.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.5-89.4%) with SLN mapping compared with 65.8% (95% CI, 58.8-73.7%). Five-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 95.1% (95% CI, 91.3-99.0%) with SLN mapping compared with 92.5% (95% CI, 88.0-97.2%). Node-negative staging with SLN mapping was associated with significantly better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56-0.72; P < 0.001) and CSS (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.61; P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. Mediation analysis confirmed a direct protective effect of SLN mapping on OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96; P < 0.01) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P < 0.01).Conclusions: Staging performed by SLN mapping with multilevel sectioning provides more accurate results than conventional staging. The observed clinically relevant and statistically significant benefit in OS and DFS is explained by a more accurate detection of positive LN by SLN mapping.

TI  - Integrating 31-Gene Expression Profiling With Clinicopathologic Features to Optimize Cutaneous Melanoma Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis Prediction
T2  - JCO PRECISION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE National guidelines recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) be offered to patients with > 10% likelihood of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity. On the other hand, guidelines do not recommend SLNB for patients with T1a tumors without high-risk features who have < 5% likelihood of a positive SLN. However, the decision to perform SLNB is less certain for patients with higher-risk T1 melanomas in which a positive node is expected 5%-10% of the time. We hypothesized that integrating clinicopathologic features with the 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) score using advanced artificial intelligence techniques would provide more precise SLN risk prediction. METHODS An integrated 31-GEP (i31-GEP) neural network algorithm incorporating clinicopathologic features with the continuous 31-GEP score was developed using a previously reported patient cohort (n = 1,398) and validated using an independent cohort (n = 1,674). RESULTS Compared with other covariates in the i31-GEP, the continuous 31-GEP score had the largest likelihood ratio (G(2) = 91.3, P < .001) for predicting SLN positivity. The i31-GEP demonstrated high concordance between predicted and observed SLN positivity rates (linear regression slope = 0.999). The i31-GEP increased the percentage of patients with T1-T4 tumors predicted to have < 5% SLN-positive likelihood from 8.5% to 27.7% with a negative predictive value of 98%. Importantly, for patients with T1 tumors originally classified with a likelihood of SLN positivity of 5%-10%, the i31-GEP reclassified 63% of cases as having < 5% or > 10% likelihood of positive SLN, for a more precise, personalized, and clinically actionable SLN-positive likelihood estimate. CONCLUSION These data suggest the i31-GEP could reduce the number of SLNBs performed by identifying patients with likelihood under the 5% threshold for performance of SLNB and improve the yield of positive SLNBs by identifying patients more likely to have a positive SLNB.

TI  - The Blue Egg Festival. Rio Negro, Los Lagos Region, Chile
T2  - RIVAR-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE VITICULTURA AGROINDUSTRIA Y RURALIDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The Blue Egg Festival is a festival held in the tenth region of the Lakes in Chile, in which it transcends the Mapuche worldview by safeguarding one of its most significant bird species such as the Mapuche Hen. This festival takes place under ritual activities and Mapuche culture, as well as gastronomy. The Mapuche chicken eggs, characteristic for their blue color in the shell, are an immense treasure of this culture and are highly appreciated by locals and foreigners due to their great nutritional va-lue. The objective of this work is to evoke the most important activities carried out in the framework of the festival, as well as to promote the preservation of the Ma-puche culture through the massification of their culture. In the same way, economic activities and projects around the celebration of the Blue Egg Festival are rescued.

TI  - Global Rangeland Primary Production and Its Consumption by Livestock in 2000-2010
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock grazing occupies ca. 25% of global ice-free land, removing large quantities of carbon (C) from global rangelands (here, including grass- and shrublands). The proportion of total livestock intake that is supplied by grazing (GP) is estimated at >50%, larger than the proportion from crop- and byproduct-derived fodders. Both rangeland productivity and its consumption through grazing are difficult to quantify, as is grazing intensity (GI), the proportion of annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) removed from rangelands by grazing livestock. We develop national or sub-national level estimates of GI and GP for 2000-2010, using remote sensing products, inventory data, and model simulations, and accounting for recent changes in livestock intake, fodder losses and waste, and national cropland use intensities. Over the 11 study years, multi-model average global rangeland ANPP varied between the values of 13.0 Pg C in 2002 and 13.96 Pg C in 2000. The global requirement for grazing intake increased monotonically by 18%, from 1.54 in 2000 to 1.82 Pg C in 2010. Although total global rangeland ANPP is roughly an order of magnitude larger than grazing demand, much of this total ANPP is unavailable for grazing, and national or sub-national deficits between intake requirements and available rangeland ANPP occurred in each year, totaling 36.6 Tg C (2.4% of total grazing intake requirement) in 2000, and an unprecedented 77.8 Tg C (4.3% of global grazing intake requirement) in 2010. After accounting for these deficits, global average GI ranged from 10.7% in 2000 to 12.6% in 2009 and 2010. The annually increasing grazing deficits suggest that rangelands are under significant pressure to accommodate rising grazing demand. Greater focus on observing, understanding, and managing the role of rangelands in feeding livestock, providing ecosystem services, and as part of the global C cycle, is warranted.

TI  - Multiscale Assessment of Agricultural Consumptive Water Use in California's Central Valley
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial estimates of crop evapotranspiration with high accuracy from the field to watershed scale have become increasingly important for water management, particularly over irrigated agriculture in semiarid regions. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment on patterns of annual agricultural water use over California's Central Valley, using 30-m daily evapotranspiration estimates based on Landsat satellite data. A semiempirical Priestley-Taylor approach was locally optimized and cross-validated with available field measurements for major crops including alfalfa, almond, citrus, corn, pasture, and rice. The evapotranspiration estimates explained >70% variance in daily measurements from independent sites with an RMSE of 0.88 mm day(-1). When aggregated over the Valley, we estimated an average evapotranspiration of 820 +/- 290 mm yr(-1) in 2014. Agricultural water use varied significantly across and within crop types, with a coefficient of variation ranging from 8% for Rice (1,110 +/- 85 mm yr(-1)) to 59% for Pistachio (592 +/- 352 mm yr(-1)). Total water uses in 2016 increased by 9.6%, as compared to 2014, mostly because of land-use conversion from fallow/idle land to cropland. Analysis across 134 Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) further showed a large variation of agricultural evapotranspiration among and within GSAs, especially for tree crops, e.g., almond evapotranspiration ranging from 339 +/- 80 mm yr(-1) in Tracy to 1,240 +/- 136 mm yr(-1) in Tri-County Water Authority. Continuous monitoring and assessment of the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of agricultural evapotranspiration provide data-driven guidance for more effective land use and water planning across scales.

TI  - Analyzing the Relationship between Animal Diversity and the Remote Sensing Vegetation Parameters: The Case of Xinjiang, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An explicit analysis of the impact for the richness of species of the vegetation phenological characteristics calculated from various remote sensing data is critical and essential for biodiversity conversion and restoration. This study collected long-term the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Leaf Area Index (LAI), the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), and the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), and calculated the six vegetation phenological characteristic parameters: the mean of the growing season, the mean of the mature season, the mean of the withered season, the annual difference value, the annual cumulative value, and the annual standard deviation in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The relationships between the vegetation phenological characteristics and the species richness of birds and mammals were analyzed in spatial distribution. The main findings include: (1) The correlation between bird diversity and vegetation factors is greater than that of mammals. (2) For remote sensing data, FAPAR is the most important vegetation parameter for both birds and mammals. (3) For vegetation phenological characteristics, the annual cumulative value of the LAI is the most crucial vegetation phenological parameter for influencing bird diversity distribution, and the annual difference value of the NDVI is the most significant driving factor for mammal diversity distribution.

TI  - Spatially Continuous and High-Resolution Land Surface Temperature Product Generation: A review of reconstruction and spatiotemporal fusion techniques
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) with spatial continuity and high spatiotemporal resolution (hereafter referred to as high resolution) is a crucial parameter for studying the thermal environment and has important applications in many fields. However, adverse atmospheric conditions, sensor malfunctioning, and scanning gaps between orbits frequently introduce spatial discontinuities into satellite-retrieved LST products. For a single sensor, a tradeoff occurs between temporal and spatial resolutions; therefore, it is almost impossible to obtain images in high resolution.

TI  - Laser Spot Center Positioning Method in Gaofen-7 Footprint Camera
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With a footprint camera for surface imaging of laser spot and at the same time, it will cause the laser spot image in the camera to overlap with the ground image, resulting in poor center positioning accuracy of the laser spot. In this paper, according to the characteristics of the images measured by GF-7 satellite footprint camera, the ground noise image classification method is proposed to optimize the Gaussian fitting spot at the same time, the classification method of the spot image and the extraction accuracy of the corresponding spot center under the background of different ground noise are analyzed. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a center positioning accuracy of 0.11, 0.13, 0.16 pixel, and a positioning variance of 0. 020, 0. 262, 0.341 pixel, respectively, under different noise conditions of low, medium, and high. At night when the signal-to-noise ratio is better, the spot positioning accuracy is 0.02 pixel, and the positioning variance is 0.0036 pixel, indicating that the noise is the most important factor affecting the spot center positioning accuracy.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a New Method for AMSU-A Cloud Detection over Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are the main source of information for operational data assimilation systems, and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) data are one of the types of satellite data that contribute most to the reduction of numerical forecast errors. However, the assimilation of AMSU-A data over land lags behind that over the ocean. In this respect, the accuracy of cloud detection over land is one of the factors affecting the assimilation of AMSU-A data, especially for the window and low-peaking channel (23-53.59 GHz and 89 GHz) data. Strong surface emissivity and high spatial and temporal variability make it difficult to distinguish between the radiative contributions of clouds and the atmosphere. Based on the differences in the response characteristics of different channels to clouds, five AMSU-A window and low-peaking channels (channels 1-4 and 15) were selected to develop a new index for cloud detection over land. Case studies showed that the AMSU-A cloud index can detect most of the convective clouds; additionally, by further matching the MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder) cloud detection index, we can effectively distinguish between cloudy and clear-sky observations. Batch test results also verified the accuracy and stability of the new cloud detection method. By referring to the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) cloud product, the POD (probability of detection) of the cloud fields of view with the new method was nearly 84%. By using the new cloud detection method to remove the cloudy data, the bias and standard deviation of the observation-minus-simulated brightness temperature (O-B) were significantly reduced, with the bias of O-B for channels 2-4 being below 1.0 K and the standard deviation of channels 5 and 6 being nearly 1.0 K.

T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent technical advances and implementation of novel radiotracers have further increased the potential of radioguided surgery for a broad variety of malignancies. Indeed, the possibilities for future applications of novel radiotracers in diverse degrees neologiesl strategies has become more promising than ever. This literature review aims to provide a contemporary update on a selected group of radiotracers and evaluates the usability of radioguided surgery and sentinel node procedures, focusing on most promising advances. For example, the impact of targeted radiotracers on prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), CD206 receptor-targeted agents (Tc-99(m)-tilmanocept), and hybrid tracers adding fluorescence to radioguidance (ICG-Tc-99(m)-nanocolloid) as well as targeting hypoxia-induced carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) will be covered. Furthermore, future outlooks on the implementation of gold nanoparticles (AuNP's), but also technical advances in improved radiotracer detection by hybrid gamma devices will be discussed.

TI  - Support for wilderness preservation: An investigation of the roles of place attachment and environmental worldview
T2  - JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wilderness areas worldwide continue to face a range of threats, however public support for wilderness areas is lacking. Similarly, there is a paucity of research literature pertaining to public support for federally-designated wilderness areas within the U.S. Borrowing from the broader pro-environmental behavior literature, the purpose of this investigation was to explore the role that individuals' environmental worldview and place attachment play in their support for wilderness. Specifically, we asked residents of the southeastern United States about their political and financial support for the management and continued protection of current wilderness areas. Data was obtained via an online panel of adults who had visited a protected natural area in the previous five years. Confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis results revealed that place attachment partially mediated the relationship between environmental worldview and support for wilderness preservation. The data suggest that models of pro-environmental behavior, generally, and wilderness preservation, specifically, should include both a measure of general environmental beliefs and a measure of an individual's thoughts and feelings ascribed to a specific setting.

TI  - Effect of tide level on submerged mangrove recognition index using multi-temporal remotely-sensed data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are intertidal wetland with a diverse assemblage of trees, shrubs and palms growing along tropical and subtropical coastlines. Effective mapping of mangrove forests has not yet been achieved due to the periodicity of tidal dynamics. Our previous studies showed that a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI), which was proposed based on the differential spectral signature of mangrove forests from high and low tides, has potential advantages in mangrove discrimination and classification. However, the effect of tide level on the performance of SMRI is still unclear. In this study, GaoFen-1 images with various tide heights were acquired, and SMRI images from low tide to high tide were obtained. Then, the resulting SMRI images were compared in detail, and the relationship between tide level and SMRI values was analyzed. This experiment was accomplished via a case study in Yunlin, Guangxi Province in China. The results showed that an increased difference in tide level led to an increase in the number of pixels of high SMRI values, indicating that more undetected submerged mangrove forests could be distinguished using SMRI. Furthermore, an exponential relationship was observed between SMRI and tide level. It suggests that SMRI effectively helps to distinguish submerged mangrove forests from multi-tide remotely-sensed imagery, and also benefits accurate mapping of mangrove forests.

TI  - Deriving drought indices from MODIS vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST): Is data reconstruction necessary?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts pose significant economic and ecological concerns, and considering climate change projections, timely monitoring and early warning based on satellite observations must be realized at regional to global scales. Nevertheless, whether data reconstruction is necessary to produce high-quality satellite-based time series data for drought monitoring and the data reconstruction approaches to be applied, if necessary, remain unclear. We attempted to fill this knowledge gap by investigating three widely used data reconstruction approaches, i.e., the Savitzky-Golay filter, harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) and Whittaker Smoother, across the Lancang-Mekong river basin through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 and MOD11A2 products for 2001-2018 and Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Several remote sensing drought indices based on the unreconstructed and reconstructed vegetation indices (VIs) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were retrieved for basin-wide drought detection. The performance of the examined reconstruction approaches was evaluated using three statistical indices (coefficient of determination (R2), standard deviation of bias (BIAS(std)) and mean squared error (MSE)), spatial consistency with the reference dataset and capability to characterize the drought events. Data reconstruction considerably enhanced the drought index performances for drought detection; however, reconstruction was not necessary in all situations. The reconstructed drought indices exhibited higher R2 values (by 10.6-10.8%), lower BIAS(std) values (by - 1.7- -12.5%), and smaller MSE values (by - 5.8- -13.4%) compared to those of unreconstructed indices. For most evaluation indicators, HANTS outperformed the other methods, and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) outperformed the other drought indices. The findings highlight the importance of data reconstruction to detect and characterize drought events and the dependency of the performance of reconstruction methods on drought indices and evaluation metrics when using MODIS time series data.

TI  - Near Real-Time Automatic Sub-Pixel Registration of Panchromatic and Multispectral Images for Pan-Sharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a near real-time automatic sub-pixel registration method of high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images using a graphics processing unit (GPU). In the first step, the method uses differential geo-registration to enable accurate geographic registration of PAN and MS images. Differential geo-registration normalizes PAN and MS images to the same direction and scale. There are also some residual misalignments due to the geometrical configuration of the acquisition instruments. These residual misalignments mean the PAN and MS images still have deviations after differential geo-registration. The second step is to use differential rectification with tiny facet primitive to eliminate possible residual misalignments. Differential rectification corrects the relative internal geometric distortion between PAN and MS images. The computational burden of these two steps is large, and traditional central processing unit (CPU) processing takes a long time. Due to the natural parallelism of the differential methods, these two steps are very suitable for mapping to a GPU for processing, to achieve near real-time processing while ensuring processing accuracy. This paper used GaoFen-6, GaoFen-7, ZiYuan3-02 and SuperView-1 satellite data to conduct an experiment. The experiment showed that our method's processing accuracy is within 0.5 pixels. The automatic processing time of this method is about 2.5 s for 1 GB output data in the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti, which can meet the near real-time processing requirements for most satellites. The method in this paper can quickly achieve high-precision registration of PAN and MS images. It is suitable for different scenes and different sensors. It is extremely robust to registration errors between PAN and MS.

TI  - In-Orbit Calibration of FengYun-3C Microwave Radiation Imager: Nonlinearity Correction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FengYun-3C (FY-3C) is the second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite in China. As one of the most important microwave payloads deployed onboard FY-3C, microwave radiation imager (MWRI) has been continuously observing radiance originating from land and sea surface and supports numerical weather predictions at regional and global scales. With a long-term monitoring of the cold-end reference, MWRI onboard FY-3C was found suffering from discontinuous observations due to its temporary power-OFF/power-ON in the years of 2015 and 2018, resulting in anomalous brightness temperature (TB) jump up to 2-3 K in magnitude at some channels. Analysis of the operating status of FY-3C MWRI indicated that deviation of the receiver system from its optimal operating status affects the nonlinearity characteristics significantly. A correction algorithm, which relates nonlinearity to the autogain control (AGC) operating voltage of the sensor, is thus proposed on the basis of on-ground thermal/vacuum (T/V) test results in the prelaunch phase in order to mitigate the calibration anomalies of FY-3C MWRI. Nonlinearity correction of FY-3C MWRI is further corroborated by comparisons of simultaneously overlapping observations of global precipitation measurement (GPM) microwave imager (GMI). The results demonstrated that after nonlinearity correction the performance of FY-3C MWRI has been improved at all channels except for the 36-V channel where technical failures have been detected since October 2016.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Grazing Cessation and Reintroduction in Mixed Prairie Using Raster Time Series Analysis of Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Great efforts have been made to manage and restore native prairies to protect native species, enrich biodiversity, protect ecological resilience, and maintain ecosystem services. Much of this has been focused on preventing degradation from overgrazing and crop conversion. Understanding the consequences of management polices is important to identify best practices. Previous research has compared restoration outcomes from variable intensity grazing, prescribed fire, and grazing removal. However, few studies have explored the optimal durations of management practices and variation in restoration outcomes among vegetation communities. This study evaluates whether the impact of grazing cessation and reintroduction varies among native vegetation communities and measures the effective time periods of grazing cessation and reintroduction. Restoration outcomes were evaluated using four biophysical indicators (fresh biomass, soil organic matter, green cover, and litter cover) and two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI)) measured from Landsat images using seasonal Kalman filter and raster time series analysis. The results show that: (i) Grazing cessation increased soil organic matter and green cover while decreasing fresh biomass compared to moderate grazing management, while grazing reintroduction influences those indicators in an opposite direction; (ii) The effective time period for prairie conservation is about 11-14 years and varies among vegetation communities and biophysical indicators; (iii) The effective intensity of grazing cessation is highest in valley grassland, moderate in upland grassland, and mildest in sloped grassland; (iv) Grazing reintroduction returned the three native vegetation communities to the initial condition (i.e., the stage in 1985 before large grazers were removed), with less time than the time consumed for grazing cessation to restore the prairie ecosystem to the maximum changes; (v) Grazing reintroduction effectively influences upland and valley grasslands for 7 to 9 years, varying from different indicators, while it continuously affected sloped grassland with no clear time lag; (vi) The intensity of grazing reintroduction was strongest in sloped grassland, moderate in upland grassland, and mildest in valley grassland. The results of this study suggest expected time periods for prairie management methods to achieve results.

TI  - Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration at Field Scale Using the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Dataset, with Sharpened VIIRS as a Sentinel-2 Thermal Proxy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and frequent monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) at sub-field scales can provide valuable information for agricultural water management, quantifying crop water use and stress toward the goal of increasing crop water use efficiency and production. Using land-surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, along with surface reflectance data describing albedo and vegetation cover fraction, surface energy balance models can generate ET maps down to a 30 m spatial resolution. However, the temporal sampling by such maps can be limited by the relatively infrequent revisit period of Landsat data (8 days for combined Landsats 7 and 8), especially in cloudy areas experiencing rapid changes in moisture status. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, as a good complement to the Landsat system, provide surface reflectance data at 10-20 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit period but do not have a thermal sensor. On the other hand, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) provides TIR data on a near-daily basis with 375 m resolution, which can be refined through thermal sharpening using S2 reflectances. This study assesses the utility of augmenting the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset with S2-sharpened VIIRS as a thermal proxy source on S2 overpass days, enabling 30 m ET mapping at a potential combined frequency of 2-3 days (including Landsat). The value added by including VIIRS-S2 is assessed both retrospectively and operationally in comparison with flux tower observations collected from several U.S. agricultural sites covering a range of crop types. In particular, we evaluate the performance of VIIRS-S2 ET estimates as a function of VIIRS view angle and cloud masking approach. VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals (MAE of 0.49 mm d(-1) against observations) generally show comparable accuracy to Landsat ET (0.45 mm d(-1)) on days of commensurate overpass, but with decreasing performance at large VIIRS view angles. Low-quality VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals linked to imperfect VIIRS/S2 cloud masking are also discussed, and caution is required when applying such data for generating ET timeseries. Fused daily ET time series benefited during the peak growing season from the improved multi-source temporal sampling afforded by VIIRS-S2, particularly in cloudy regions and over surfaces with rapidly changing vegetation conditions, and value added for real-time monitoring applications is discussed. This work demonstrates the utility and feasibility of augmenting the HLS dataset with sharpened VIIRS TIR imagery on S2 overpass dates for generating high spatiotemporal resolution ET products.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Thickness with Custom Aerosol Model Using SKYNET Data over the Chiba Area
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from remotely-sensed data relies on the adopted aerosol model. However, the method of this technique has been rather limited because of the high variability of the surface albedo, in addition to the spatial variability in the aerosol properties over the land surfaces. To overcome unsolved problems, we proposed a method for the visibility-derived AOT estimation from SKYNET-based measurement and daytime satellite images with a custom aerosol model over the Chiba area (35.62 degrees N, 140.10 degrees E), which is located in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area in Japan. Different from conventionally-used aerosol models for the boundary layer, we created a custom aerosol model by using sky-radiometer observation data of aerosol volume size distribution and refractive indices, coupled with spectral response functions (SPFs) of satellite visible bands to alleviate the wide range of path-scattered radiance. We utilized the radiative transfer code 6S to implement the radiative transfer calculation based on the created custom aerosol model. The concurrent data from ground-based measurement are used in the radiative analysis, namely the temporal variation of AOT from SKYNET. The radiative estimation conducted under clear-sky conditions with minimum aerosol loading is used for the determination of the surface albedo, so that the 6S simulation yields a well-defined relation between total radiance and surface albedo. We made look-up tables (LUTs) pixel-by-pixel over the Chiba area for the custom aerosol model to retrieve the satellite AOT distribution based on the surface albedo. Therefore, such a reference of surface albedo generated from clear-sky conditions, in turn, can be employed to retrieve the spatial distribution of AOT on both clear and relatively turbid days. The value for the AOTs retrieved using the custom aerosol model is found to be stable than conventionally-used typical aerosol models, indicating that our method yields substantially better performance.

TI  - Optical properties of atmospheric aerosol over Cape Town, Western Cape of South Africa: Role of biomass burning
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical characteristics of atmospheric aerosol are vital in the determination of regional climate trends. Biomass burning is typically known to influence aerosol optical characteristics. Following the incessant biomass burning and the recent drop in precipitation over Western Cape, aerosol optical properties with a focus on the impact of biomass burning are studied over Cape Town using data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In general terms, measurements from both platforms significantly agree on the estimates of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and water vapor content. The mean AOD (0.075 +/- 0.022) and the angstrom ngstrom exponent (0.63 +/- 0.19) derived from AERONET demonstrate the dominance of coarse mode aerosol typical of maritime aerosol. Similarly, aerosol particle size distributions display the predominance of coarse mode particles. However, the derived refractive index is more representative of urban-industrial aerosol. Also, estimated back-trajectories show that more than 70% of the aerosol particles over the region originate over the ocean. Atmospheric vapor increases from winter to summer, mainly influenced by air temperature, supersaturation level, and absorbing aerosol. Furthermore, two significant sources accounted for biomass burning related to high AOD values: local biomass burning and regionally transported aged smoke majorly from elsewhere in Sothern Africa.

TI  - Isolation of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 7 from cattle showing fever in Japan in 2016 and improvement of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay to detect epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an arthropod-borne disease of wild and domestic ruminants caused by the EHD virus (EHDV). To date, seven EHDV serotypes have been identified. In Japan, strain Ibaraki of EHDV serotype 2 has caused outbreaks of Ibaraki disease in cattle. In addition, EHDV serotype 7 (EHDV-7) has caused large-scale EHD epizootics. In mid-September 2016, eight cattle at a breeding farm in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan developed fever. Since EHDV-7 was detected in sentinel cattle in western Japan in 2016, we suspected that the cause of this fever might be an EHDV-7 infection. In this study, we tested cattle for EHDV-7 and some other viruses. Consequently, EHDV was isolated from washed blood cells collected from three of the eight cattle, and genetic analysis of genome segment 2 revealed that this isolate was EHDV-7. Moreover, all affected cattle tested positive for anti-EHDV-7 neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that the fever was caused by EHDV-7 infection. In addition, we modified a conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for the specific detection of EHDV. This modified assay could detect various strains of EHDV isolated in Japan, Australia, and North America. Furthermore, the assay permitted the detection of EHDV-7 in blood cells collected from seven of the eight cattle. We believe that this modified assay will be a useful tool for the diagnosis of EHD.

TI  - A comparison of wetland landscape pattern changes of Yalu River Estuary between China and North Korea in recent 40 years
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yalu River Estuary is an important part of waterbird migration corridor in the Northeast Asia -Australasia Flyway. Based on Landsat MSS/TM/OLI remote sensing images, the land cover datasets of Yalu River Estuary in six periods from 1980 to 2020 were obtained by a combination of object -oriented and random forest classifications. By analyzing wetland area, landscape metrics, wetland centroid migration, we compared the differences between China and North Korea, by quantitatively comparing the impacts of human activities on wetland landscape change. Results showed that: ( 1) Over the past 40 years, total wetland area in the Yalu River Estuary experienced a decreasing trend, with a high wetland loss rate ( 15%) on the Chinese side and a low wetland loss rate on the North Korean side ( 12%). ( 2) The changes of landscape metrics suggested that wetlands in the Yalu River Estuary tended to be fragmented and the connectivity between landscapes decreased. ( 3) Consistent expansion of cultivated land and artificial surface was the main driving force for wetland loss. (4) During the four decades, the centroid of wetland landscape moved 1.4 km seaward. The conservation effectiveness of coastal wetlands over the Yalu River Estuary should be improved. Our findings could facilitate management, development and biodiversity conservation of estuarine wetland ecosystems.

TI  - The First Global Carbon Dioxide Flux Map Derived from TanSat Measurements
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Space-borne measurements of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations provide global observation constraints for top-down estimates of surface carbon flux. Here, the first estimates of the global distribution of carbon surface fluxes inferred from dry-air CO2 column (XCO2) measurements by the Chinese Global Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Scientific Experimental Satellite (TanSat) are presented. An ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) data assimilation system coupled with the GEOS-Chem global chemistry transport model is used to optimally fit model simulations with the TanSat XCO2 observations, which were retrieved using the Institute of Atmospheric Physics Carbon dioxide retrieval Algorithm for Satellite remote sensing (IAPCAS). High posterior error reduction (30%-50%) compared with a priori fluxes indicates that assimilating satellite XCO2 measurements provides highly effective constraints on global carbon flux estimation. Their impacts are also highlighted by significant spatiotemporal shifts in flux patterns over regions critical to the global carbon budget, such as tropical South America and China. An integrated global land carbon net flux of 6.71 +/- 0.76 Gt C yr(-1) over 12 months (May 2017-April 2018) is estimated from the TanSat XCO2 data, which is generally consistent with other inversions based on satellite data, such as the JAXA GOSAT and NASA OCO-2 XCO2 retrievals. However, discrepancies were found in some regional flux estimates, particularly over the Southern Hemisphere, where there may still be uncorrected bias between satellite measurements due to the lack of independent reference observations. The results of this study provide the groundwork for further studies using current or future TanSat XCO2 data together with other surface-based and space-borne measurements to quantify biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange.

TI  - Full Lifecycle Monitoring on Drought-Converted Catastrophic Flood Using Sentinel-1 SAR: A Case Study of Poyang Lake Region during Summer 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During summer 2020, the most catastrophic flood in the 21st century attacked the Poyang Lake region, one of the flood-prone areas in China. To explore the occurrence mechanism and evolution patterns of this drought-converted flood better, a full lifecycle model is developed in this article. Employing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, with the advantages of high spatial-temporal resolution and all-day and all-weather working capacity, a bimodal threshold was applied to efficiently extract flood inundation mapping. Thus, 61 Sentinel-1 SAR images in 2020 were used to establish inundation sequences for full lifecycle monitoring. This flood presented an abrupt transformation from drought, a long duration, and the slow receding of water, and its area exceeded 3000 km(2) from July to early October. In addition, inundation models that reflect the lake area and water level relationship were introduced to assist near-real-time monitoring. Through hydrological and meteorological analysis, compared with results of previous years (from 2010 to 2019), this study found that the water level from July to October in 2020 was at least 17% higher than the mean level at the same period in history and water volume had increased about 44.13 billion m(3) during the flooding period. Similarly, the average precipitation from June to September was significantly higher than the same period of previous years. It was the abnormal sustained heavy precipitation and sharp rising of the water level that caused this catastrophic flood. In particular, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) increased from -1.02 in April to 1.31 in July, indicating that the flood was abruptly converted from drought. The inundated areas of several land types during different periods of the full lifecycle were calculated for damage assessment. It was found that cropland was the most heavily impaired with a maximum inundated area of 1375.67 km(2), while other land types including forest, grassland, wetland, and impervious surface were relatively less damaged. The study results demonstrate that flood full lifecycle monitoring based on SAR data is helpful to explore the patterns of flood evolution, analyze causes, and assess damage. Simultaneously, focusing on drought-converted floods contributes to the understanding of flood patterns, which provides relevant management departments with decision support for disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - The 21 May 2021 <i>M</i><sub>s</sub>6. 4 Yangbi (Yunnan) earthquake : A shallow strike-slip event rupturing in a blind fault
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 May 2021, an Ms 6. 4 earthquake struck the Yangbi County, Dali Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. The epicenter of this earthquake is located near the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault on the western edge of the Sichuan-Yunnan rhombus block. As the largest earthquake to hit this area in the past 45 years, rapid disaster response and source parameters inversion will provide important help for earthquake disaster mitigation. Because no surface rupture related to this event has been reported, the seismogenic fault of this earthquake is still unknown. In this study, we acquired coseismic deformation related to this earthquake by means of Sentinel-1A/B interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and then inverted the fault geometry and detailed slip distribution. The inversion results show that the coseismic rupture is mainly dominated by the right-lateral strike-slip faulting with minor normal components. The majority of slip is confined at depths from 2 to 12 km with a peak value of 0. 64 m at depth of 7 km. The absence of slip in the shallow part (0 similar to 2 km) of the rupture fault reveals an important coseismic slip deficit area, which is likely to be compensated by postseismic afterslip and interseismic slip. By an integrated analysis of the inversions, aftershock sequence and tectonic feature of the regional faults, we proposed that a blind branch fault splaying from the WeixiQiaohou-Weishan fault at depth or a new unknown blind fault may be responsible for this earthquake. Our calculated coseismic Coulomb stress changes show a high rupture risk at the northern extremity of the Weishan segment of the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault, southernmost end of the Yushichang-Qiaohou segment of the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault and northern extremity of the middle segment of the Eryuan-Midu fault.

T2  - MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes the surface current characteristics along the coast of the Chinese mainland in autumn and winter by the trajectories of coastal drifters and remote sensing data. The results show the following: (1) During autumn and winter 2018, the paths of drifters were consistent with that of the Zhe-Min Coastal Water, while the Zhe-Min Coastal Water had a branch intruding the coast of Taiwan Island. (2) When the northeast monsoon weakened or changed direction in a short period, the Zhe-Min Coastal Water showed a reverse flow. (3) In the northeastern South China Sea, the drifter path meandered due to a dipole's influence. (4) Around the frontal area near the Taiwan Bank, the paths of drifters showed a 12.4-h periodic variation, which was mainly controlled by the tidal current. These findings show that the coastal drifter is a useful tool to observe surface currents.

TI  - On-Orbit Radiometric Calibration Method for Satellites Based on TOA Reflectance at Baotou Site
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic radiometric calibration is the latest development trend in the field calibration of satellites. Its core is to obtain TOA ( top of atmosphere) reflectance that can be compared with satellite observation data on a regular basis. This paper developed an on-orbit radiometric calibration method for satellites based on the TOA reflectance at the Baotou site. Firstly, the empirical model for TOA reflectance was built based on the long-timeseries observation data from a high-precision reference satellite over the automatic radiometric calibration field. This model was used to correct the TOA reflectance of the automatic radiometric calibration field at other moments. Consequently, the uncertainty of TOA reflectance was reduced, and the accuracy of radiometric calibration was improved. The proposed method was validated and analyzed with Sentinel-2A/2B as the reference satellite and the TOA reflectance of sand targets at the Baotou site as the research object. The results show that the model built in this paper has high accuracy, and the average relative difference between the predicted values of the model and the observed values of Sentinel-2 is less than 2% (less than 3% in the blue band). With this model, the relative difference between TOA reflectance at the Baotou site and the actual TOA reflectance observed by Sentinel-2 can be greatly reduced and the inconsistency is decreased from 5 %-6 % to less than 3%. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Scalloping Suppression for ScanSAR Images Based on Modified Kalman Filter With Preprocessing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) mode is widely used in Earth observation because of its capability of acquiring wide-swath images with moderate resolution. However, due to the operation mechanism of ScanSAR mode, the acquired images often suffer from the scalloping problem, resulting in significant deterioration of image quality. In this article, a novel scalloping suppression method is proposed for ScanSAR images based on the modified Kalman filter with preprocessing. First, an image model is built to analyze the effect caused by scalloping. Then, a modified Kalman filter is proposed to estimate the intensity of scalloping. However, if the scene is complicated or the scalloping effect is strong, the Kalman filter works with poor performance. Therefore, an innovative preprocessing operation is introduced, involving image segmentation and pixel value filling. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the GaoFen-3 (GF-3) and TerraSAR-X satellite images with different scenes. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accommodate the complex scene well and achieve effective scalloping suppression.

TI  - Effects of Urbanization on Ecosystem Services in the Shandong Peninsula Urban Agglomeration, in China: The Case of Weifang City
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services are the material basis of economic and social development, and play essential roles in the sustainable development of ecosystems. Urbanization can remarkably alter the provision of ecosystem services. Most studies in this area have focused on densely populated metropolises with poor ecological environments, while comparatively few studies have focused on cities with low ecological pressures. Therefore, to avoid continuing to engage in the repetitive pattern of destroying first and rehabilitating later, quantitative analyses of urbanization and ecosystem services should be carried out in representative cities. In this study, based on partial least squares-discriminant analysis, kernel density estimation, and correlation analysis, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of urbanization on ecosystem services in Weifang city. The Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research provided remote sensing data on land use, the gross domestic production (GDP), population data, and ecosystem services. The results were as follows: (1) The variation in population, GDP, and built-up areas consistently increased throughout the study period, whereas the ecosystem service values (ESVs) decreased; (2) food production, raw material production, nutrient cycle maintenance, and soil conservation were decisive ecosystem services that led to vast reductions in ESVs during the process of urbanization; and (3) the negative correlation coefficient between built-up areas and ecosystem services was greater than that between the population or GDP and ecosystem services, which indicated that the impacts of population and economic urbanization on ecosystem services lagged behind the impact of land urbanization. This study provides references for fully recognizing the ecological effects of urbanization, and make suggestions regarding the application of ecosystem services in sustainable development.

TI  - Retrieval of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in the Coastal Waters of the Beibu Gulf in Guangxi Using a Gradient-Boosting Decision Tree Model
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing for the monitoring of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is essential to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional water quality monitoring, strengthen red tide disaster monitoring and early warnings, and reduce marine environmental risks. In this study, a machine learning approach called the Gradient-Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) was employed to develop an algorithm for estimating the Chl-a concentrations of the coastal waters of the Beibu Gulf in Guangxi, using Landsat 8 OLI image data as the image source in combination with field measurements of Chl-a concentrations. The GBDT model with B4, B3 + B4, B3, B1 - B4, B2 + B4, B1 + B4, and B2 - B4 as input features exhibited higher accuracy (MAE = 0.998 mu g/L, MAPE = 19.413%, and RMSE = 1.626 mu g/L) compared with different physics models, providing a new method for remote sensing inversion of water quality parameters. The GBDT model was used to study the spatial distribution and temporal variation of Chl-a concentrations in the coastal sea surface of the Beibu Gulf of Guangxi from 2013 to 2020. The results showed a spatial distribution with high concentrations in nearshore waters and low concentrations in offshore waters. The Chl-a concentration exhibited seasonal changes (concentration in summer > autumn > spring approximate to winter).

TI  - Light-Weight Cloud Detection Network for Optical Remote Sensing Images with Attention-Based DeeplabV3+Architecture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds in optical remote sensing images cause spectral information change or loss, that affects image analysis and application. Therefore, cloud detection is of great significance. However, there are some shortcomings in current methods, such as the insufficient extendibility due to using the information of multiple bands, the intense extendibility due to relying on some manually determined thresholds, and the limited accuracy, especially for thin clouds or complex scenes caused by low-level manual features. Combining the above shortcomings and the requirements for efficiency in practical applications, we propose a light-weight deep learning cloud detection network based on DeeplabV3+ architecture and channel attention module (CD-AttDLV3+), only using the most common red-green-blue and near-infrared bands. In the CD-AttDLV3+ architecture, an optimized backbone network-MobileNetV2 is used to reduce the number of parameters and calculations. Atrous spatial pyramid pooling effectively reduces the information loss caused by multiple down-samplings while extracting multi-scale features. CD-AttDLV3+ concatenates more low-level features than DeeplabV3+ to improve the cloud boundary quality. The channel attention module is introduced to strengthen the learning of important channels and improve the training efficiency. Moreover, the loss function is improved to alleviate the imbalance of samples. For the Landsat-8 Biome set, CD-AttDLV3+ achieves the highest accuracy in comparison with other methods, including Fmask, SVM, and SegNet, especially for distinguishing clouds from bright surfaces and detecting light-transmitting thin clouds. It can also perform well on other Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images. Experimental results indicate that CD-AttDLV3+ is robust, with a high accuracy and extendibility.

TI  - Deep Learning for Chlorophyll-a Concentration Retrieval: A Case Study for the Pearl River Estuary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance of phytoplankton is generally estimated by measuring the chlorophyll-a concentration (C-chla), which is an important factor in photosynthesis and can be used to analyze the density and biomass of phytoplankton in the ecosystem. The band-ratio-based empirical or semi-analytical algorithms are operationally applied to retrieve C-chla in global oceans, which generally experience difficulties from the diversity of optical properties and the complexity of the radiative transfer equations in analytical analyses, respectively. With an attempt to develop an accurate C-chla retrieval model for the optically complex coastal and estuarine waters, this study aimed to explore the deep learning (DL) methods in satellite retrieval of C-chla. A two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN), named C-chla-Net, was proposed, which utilized the spectral information of remote sensing reflectances at MODIS/Aqua's visible bands. In the first-stage phase, the C-chla-Net was pretrained by a set of remote sensing patches, in which the C-chla was generated from an existing model (OC3M). The pretrained results were than used as the initial values to refine the network with the synthetic oversampled in-situ dataset in the second-stage training phase. Using in-situ samples for training with the new initial values has a higher probability to reach the global optimum. The quantitative analyses showed that the two-stage training was more likely to achieve a global optimum in the optimization than the one-stage training. Matchups of the in-situ C-chla measurements were used to evaluate the retrieval models. Results showed that the proposed C-chla-Net produced obvious better performance than the empirical and semi-analytical algorithms, implying the DL method was more effective for optically complex waters with extremely high C-chla. This study provided an applicable method for remote sensing retrieval of C-chla, which should be helpful for studying the spatial distribution and temporal variability in the productive Pearl River estuary (PRE) waters.

TI  - Cross-calibration of Chinese Gaofen-5 thermal infrared images and its improvement on land surface temperature retrieval
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing technology is capable of acquiring large-scale land surface temperature (LST), which is a key factor in the energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere. The visible and infrared multispectral sensor (VIMS) equipped in the Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite can obtain four channels of TIR images with a 40 m spatial resolution. However, due to the change of working environment, the TIR sensor suffers a low-accurate radiometric calibration that needs improvement. This paper puts forward a new crosscalibration for GF-5/VIMS TIR images by linking the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance of the vertical angle MODIS observation with the GF-5/VIMS image to estimate the radiometric calibration coefficients, Gain and Offset. To verify the recalibration performance, a new nonlinear two-channel split-window (SW) algorithm and a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) method which is used to refine LST from the SW algorithm by minimizing the residuals, were developed for the recalibrated GF-5/VIMS TIR 3 and TIR 4 channels. The radiometric cross-calibration algorithm and the optimized SW algorithm were applied to real GF-5/VIMS TIR images. The validation results showed that the brightness temperature and LST were improved significantly, and the LST retrieval error was reduced greatly to 1.79 K after recalibration, indicating a large improvement of the LST retrieval for GF-5/VIMS TIR image using the proposed cross-calibration and SW algorithms.

TI  - EXPERT PERCEPTIONS OF CONFLICTS IN AFRICAN VULTURE CONSERVATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERCOMING ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING DILEMMAS
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Because African vultures are declining due to anthropogenic causes, we linked conservation management with social science by examining the ethical perspectives of individuals responsible for the management of vultures. Understanding these perspectives can help balance scientific knowledge with stakeholder concerns, resulting in more effective decision-making. We interviewed 37 vulture conservationists: 24 in South Africa and Kenya fromJuly-August 2017, and the remaining 13 at a conference in the United States from October-November 2017. We used a Q-Methodology activity in which participants ranked a set of statements (termed Q-sort questions) that we had generated based on pre-study interviews and published literature. This methodology is a social science tool that quantitatively evaluates subjective characteristics such as the values that shape a participant's ethical worldview. A follow-up, semi-structured interview provided a deeper understanding of the participants' statement rankings. Together, both steps addressed individual beliefs and how the participants framed their ethical value structures. We found that the conservationists interviewed, regardless of background, held an overall ethical commitment to duty that guides them as they pursue their conservation management work. The Q-sort analysis suggested three different factors that reflected their expressed views: (1) a biocentric perspective (moral status given to all living things in nature) but with strong negative linkage toward vultures having value for human use (nonanthropocentric intrinsic value), (2) an environmental virtue ethics perspective (moral values are based on a person's character rather than whether specific actions are right or wrong) with consideration given toward vultures having possible value for human use, and (3) an ecocentric perspective (holistic, wherein moral consideration is given to both species and ecosystems) that was neutral with regard to vultures having value for human use (intrinsic value). Insights gained from this study represent an initial step in elucidating stakeholder perspectives and will contribute to the conservation of African vultures.

TI  - Quality Scoring of the Fengyun 4A Clear Sky Radiance Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Clear Sky Radiance (CSR) product has been widely used instead of Level 1 (L1) geostationary imager data in data assimilation for numerical weather prediction due to its many advantages concerning superobservation methodology. In this study, CSR was produced in two water vapor channels (channels 9 and channel 10, with wavelengths at 5.8-6.7 mu m and 6.9-7.3 mu m) of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager aboard Fengyun 4A. The root mean square error (RMSE) between CSR observations and backgrounds was used as a quality flag and was predicted by cloud cover, standard deviation (STD), surface type, and elevation of a CSR field of view (FOV). Then, a centesimal scoring system based on the predicted RMSE was set to a CSR FOV that indicates its percentile point in the quality distribution of the whole FOV. Validations of the scoring system demonstrated that the biases of the predicted RMSE were small for all FOVs and that the score was consistent with the predicted RMSE, especially for FOVs with high scores. We suggest using this score for quality control (QC) to replace the QC of cloud cover, STD, and elevation of CSR, and we propose 40 points as the QC threshold for the two channels, above which the predicted RMSE of a CSR is superior to the RMSE of averaged clear-sky L1 data.

TI  - An Advanced SAR Image Despeckling Method by Bernoulli-Sampling-Based Self-Supervised Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the main sources of remote sensing big data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide all-day and all-weather Earth image acquisition. However, speckle noise in SAR images brings a notable limitation for its big data applications, including image analysis and interpretation. Deep learning has been demonstrated as an advanced method and technology for SAR image despeckling. Most existing deep-learning-based methods adopt supervised learning and use synthetic speckled images to train the despeckling networks. This is because they need clean images as the references, and it is hard to obtain purely clean SAR images in real-world conditions. However, significant differences between synthetic speckled and real SAR images cause the domain gap problem. In other words, they cannot show superior performance for despeckling real SAR images as they do for synthetic speckled images. Inspired by recent studies on self-supervised denoising, we propose an advanced SAR image despeckling method by virtue of Bernoulli-sampling-based self-supervised deep learning, called SSD-SAR-BS. By only using real speckled SAR images, Bernoulli-sampled speckled image pairs (input-target) were obtained as the training data. Then, a multiscale despeckling network was trained on these image pairs. In addition, a dropout-based ensemble was introduced to boost the network performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art for speckle noise suppression on both synthetic speckled and real SAR datasets (i.e., Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X).

TI  - Attributive Gastronomic Metaphor in Russian: Aspects of Typology
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the metaphorized aspects of the attributive semantics associated with the peculiarities of conceptualizing various features of food. The authors typologize attributes that are the basis of metaphorical projections of the gastronomic sphere phenomena onto a wide range of concepts from various target areas (thinking, psyche, social life phenomena, various objects of the physical world). The analysis of trends and aspects of food features metaphorization in Russian is presented on the material of figurative lexical and phraseological units. Food attributes are classified based on various methods of sensory signal cognitive processing with respect to the perception modality (intramodal, polymodal, crossmodal), rational or sensory perception dominant (rational - empirical), direct or indirect way of nomination (intensional - extensional), and the presence of evaluative attitude to a certain quality of food (axiological). As a result, a set of food product attributes relevant for the metaphorization process is identified and the figurative means of the Russian language are classified with a detailed description of aspects and trends of the figurative interpretation of these attributes within each class. The article presents a coherent fragment of the metaphorical worldview expressed by Russian attributive food metaphors. The following cognitive bases for metaphorical affinity are determined: 1) the ability to distinguish various tastes; 2) strong/weak taste receptors excitation; 3) pleasure/displeasure from taste sensations; 4) the degree of original positive food qualities preservation; 5) associations with food appearance as an attribute reference pattern; 6) food nutritional value; 7) contiguity of taste and olfactory perception modalities. The fixed sensory images based on perceptive food properties are used for metaphorical characteristics of human appearance and character, psycho-emotional state, life situations and social activities, economic phenomena, speech and artistic works. Examples of attributive food metaphor's textual representation in artistic, popular science, journalistic and advertising discourses demonstrate its significant pragmatic potential.

TI  - Metaphors and linguistic image in the analysis of phraseological units of the archaic Olonkho narrative
T2  - REVISTA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes metaphors in the linguistic image of the world using the description of the sky (abibi) and underground (aaacbi), mythical creatures represented in phraseological units with numbers in T.V. Zakharov-Chaabij's Epic (2018) "Bulkun Wing the Hero". Compositional analysis, context analysis and the method of phraseological identification were used. The general method of investigation is induction-deduction, with theoretical conclusions drawn from the analysis of the material. The study of the linguistic image of the world in the Yakut epic Olonkho provides insight into the hidden creative process of an Olonkho narrator that recreates the structured and almost canonized oral tradition embedded in his repertoire. Phraseological units (PU) with a numerical component reflect a specific worldview through two opposing forces. PU animates the epic image of the world, representing a unique and rich language, and preserving the distant world of ancestors for us and future generations

TI  - Predicting Mountain Hikers' Pro-Environmental Behavioral Intention: An Extension to the Theory of Planned Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Executive SummaryNature-based recreation activities play a significant role in the tourism industry and have provided myriad opportunities for the protection of natural areas. It is essential to investigate individuals' behavior during such activities to avoid further damage to precious and dwindling natural resources. This study develops a robust model that provides a comprehensive understanding of the formation of pro-environmental behavioral intentions among climbers of Mount Damavand National Park in Iran. To this end, we combined the theory of planned behavior (TPB), value-belief-norm theory (VBN), and a hierarchical model of leisure constraints to predict individuals' pro-environmental hiking behavior during outdoor recreation. We used structural equation modeling to test the theoretical framework. A sample of 787 climbers was analyzed. Among the theory of planned behavior variables, perceived behavioral control showed the strongest association with behavioral intention (beta =.57). This relationship indicates that if people feel they can have fewer negative impacts on national resources while hiking, it will result in more environmentally acceptable behavior. Subjective norms had a moderate positive impact on behavioral intention, indicating the importance of other people on the individual's behavior. Attitude had a small positive effect on intention. Biospheric-altruistic values were not significantly associated with an individual's ecological worldview, while egoistic values had a weak negative influence on an individual's ecological worldview. Moreover, ecological worldview positively influenced attitude and personal belief. Personal belief (awareness of consequences and ascribed responsibility) showed a positive association with TPB variables. Although the data showed a high average score in awareness of consequences (mean = 4.219 out of 5), evidence from Mount Damavand shows that there are many environmental issues that need addressing (e.g., vast amounts of garbage). National park managers need to make sure that their solutions result in awareness about pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Findings support the hypothesized negative relationship between constraints and all TPB predictors. Providing proper restrooms and parking spaces in campgrounds, strategies controlling limiting capacity and solutions for removing waste from high altitudes are helpful to decrease the negative impact of structural constraints. In order to address intrapersonal constraints, managers should provide opportunities to interest individuals in environmental activities, such as environmental celebrations or making documentaries about environmental issues. Moreover, promoting a culture of environmental protection in the Mount Damavand area would reduce interpersonal constraints. Overall, the proposed model improved the explanatory power of the TPB by predicting 64.7% of intention compared to the original TPB that accounted for 63.8% of the variance in intention.

TI  - Exposure of Free-Ranging Wild Animals to Zoonotic <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> Sensu Stricto in Slovenia
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife can serve as a reservoir for highly contagious and deadly diseases, many of which are infectious to domestic animals and/or humans. Wildlife pathogen and disease surveillance is, thus, an essential tool that can provide valuable information on population health status and protect human health. Blood samples from 244 wild animals and 5 from carcasses were tested for specific antibodies against Leptospira serovars in Slovenia between 2019 and 2020 using the microscopic agglutination test. The results confirm that various wildlife species were exposed to Leptospira interrogans and may be used as a sentinel for leptospirosis, which is considered a significant health threat to other wildlife species and to humans. A total of 249 serum samples from 13 wild animal species namely fallow deer (Dama dama, n = 1), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus, n = 80), red deer (Cervus elaphus, n = 22), chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra, n = 21), mouflon (Ovis musimon, n = 4), brown hare (Lepus europaeus, n = 2), nutria (Myocastor coypus, n = 1), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n = 97), stone marten (Martes foina, n = 12), European badger (Meles meles, n = 2), golden jackal (Canis aureus, n = 2) Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx, n = 2) and grey wolf (Canis lupus, n = 3) were analysed for the presence of antibodies against Leptospira interrogans sensu stricto. Serum samples were examined via the microscopic agglutination test for the presence of specific antibodies against Leptospira serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae, Bratislava, Pomona, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Sejroe, Australis, Autumnalis, Canicola, Saxkoebing and Tarassovi. Antibodies to at least one of the pathogenic serovars were detected in 77 (30.9%; CI = 25-37%) sera. The proportion of positive samples varied intraspecifically and was the biggest in large carnivores (lynx, wolf and jackal; 86%), followed by mezzo predators: stone marten (67%) and red fox (34%), and large herbivores: red deer (32%), roe deer (25%), alpine chamois (10%) and mouflon (0%). Out of the 77 positive samples, 42 samples (53.8%) had positive titres against a single serovar, while 35 (45.4%) samples had positive titres against two or more serovars. The most frequently detected antibodies were those against the serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae. The present study confirmed the presence of multiple pathogenic serovars in wildlife throughout Slovenia. It can be concluded that wild animals are reservoirs for at least some of the leptospiral serovars and are a potential source of leptospirosis for other wild and domestic animals, as well as for humans.

T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryHuman intervention in ecosystems is motivated by various functional needs, such as provisioning ecosystem services, but often has unexpected detrimental outcomes. A major question in ecology is how to manage human intervention so as to achieve its goal without impairing ecosystem function. The main idea pursued here is the need to identify the inherent response ways of ecosystems to disturbances, and use them as road maps for conducting interventions. This approach is demonstrated mathematically using two contexts, grazing management and vegetation restoration, and compared to remote sensing data for the latter. Among the surprising insights obtained is the beneficial effect of grazing, in terms of resilience to droughts, that can be achieved by managing it non-uniformly in space.Humans play major roles in shaping and transforming the ecology of Earth. Unlike natural drivers of ecosystem change, which are erratic and unpredictable, human intervention in ecosystems generally involves planning and management, but often results in detrimental outcomes. Using model studies and aerial-image analysis, we argue that the design of a successful human intervention form calls for the identification of the self-organization modes that drive ecosystem change, and for studying their dynamics. We demonstrate this approach with two examples: grazing management in drought-prone ecosystems, and rehabilitation of degraded vegetation by water harvesting. We show that grazing can increase the resilience to droughts, rather than imposing an additional stress, if managed in a spatially non-uniform manner, and that fragmental restoration along contour bunds is more resilient than the common practice of continuous restoration in vegetation stripes. We conclude by discussing the need for additional studies of self-organization modes and their dynamics.

TI  - Consistent Multi-Mission Measures of Inland Water Algal Bloom Spatial Extent Using MERIS, MODIS and OLCI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Envisat's MERIS and its successor Sentinel OLCI have proven invaluable for documenting algal bloom conditions in coastal and inland waters. Observations over turbid eutrophic waters, in particular, have benefited from the band at 708 nm, which captures the reflectance peak associated with intense algal blooms and is key to line-height algorithms such as the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI). With the MERIS mission ending in early 2012 and OLCI launched in 2016, however, time-series studies relying on these two sensors have to contend with an observation gap spanning four years. Alternate sensors, such as MODIS Aqua, offering neither the same spectral band configuration nor consistent spatial resolution, present challenges in ensuring continuity in derived bloom products. This study explores a neural network (NN) solution to fill the observation gap between MERIS and OLCI with MODIS Aqua data, delivering consistent algal bloom spatial extent products from 2002 to 2020 using these three sensors. With 14 bands of MODIS level 2 partially atmospherically corrected spectral reflectance as the NN input, the missing MERIS/OLCI band at 708 nm required for the MCI is simulated. The resulting NN-derived MODIS MCI (NNMCI) is shown to be in good agreement with MERIS and OLCI MCI in 2011 and 2017 respectively over the western basin of Lake Erie (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.0032). To overcome the impact of MODIS sensor saturation over bright water targets, which otherwise renders pixels unusable for bloom detection using R-NIR wavebands, a variant NN model is employed which uses the 9 MODIS bands with the lowest probability of saturation to simulate the MCI. This variant NN predicts MCI with only a small increase in uncertainty (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.005) allowing reliable estimates of bloom conditions in those previously unreported pixels. The NNMCI is shown to be robust when applied beyond the initial training dataset on Lake Erie, and when re-trained on different geographic areas (Lake Winnipeg and Lake of the Woods). Despite differences in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, MODIS algal bloom presence/absence was correctly classified in >92% of cases and bloom spatial extent derived within 25% uncertainty, allowing the application to the 2012-2015 time period to form a continuous and consistent multi-mission monitoring dataset from 2002 to 2020.

TI  - Nonparametric pattern recognition algorithm for testing a hypothesis of the independence of random variables
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method for testing a hypothesis of the independence of multidimensional random variables is proposed. The technique under consideration is based on the use of a nonparametric pattern recognition algorithm that meets a maximum likelihood criterion. In contrast to the traditional formulation of the pattern recognition problem, there is no a priori training sample. The initial information is represented by statistical data, which are made up of the values of a multivariate random variable. The distribution laws of random variables in the classes are estimated according to the initial statistical data for the conditions of their dependence and independence. When selecting optimal bandwidths for nonparametric kernel-type probability density estimates, the minimum standard deviation is used as a criterion. Estimates of the probability of pattern recognition error in the classes are calculated. Based on the minimum value of the estimates of the probabilities of pattern recognition errors, a decision is made on the independence or dependence of the random variables. The technique developed is used in the spectral analysis of remote sensing data.

TI  - Use of Remote Sensing to Assess the Water-Saving Effect of Winter Wheat Fallow
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat fallow policy has a greater effect on water resource management, and the water-saving effect in the fallow process of winter wheat can provide data support for precise water resource utilization planning. In order to evaluate the water resource consumption of winter wheat and the related effect from winter wheat fallow, this study searched the changing trends of cultivated land evapotranspiration under five different scenarios through the object-oriented extraction method and a SEBS model based on multi-source data. The results indicated that the evapotranspiration during winter wheat growing period was higher than that of winter wheat fallow land, and there was no big difference in evapotranspiration between the fallow land during harvesting and the emergence of new crops. The evapotranspiration of winter wheat was higher than that of various fallow land, and the evapotranspiration of abandoned land was higher than other fallow land in the winter wheat growing season. From this point, this study concludes that the fallow land policy can effectively reduce evapotranspiration during the growing of winter wheat, which is conducive to the sustainable exploiting of water resources.

TI  - Quantifying the Potential Contribution of Urban Forest to PM<sub>2.5</sub> Removal in the City of Shanghai, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and air pollution pose multiple health threats to humans through complex and interacting pathways, whereas urban vegetation can improve air quality by influencing pollutant deposition and dispersion. This study estimated the amount of PM2.5 removal by the urban forest in the city of Shanghai by using remote sensing data of vegetation and a model approach. We also identified its potential contribution of urban forest presence in relation to human population and particulate matter concentration. Results show that the urban forest in Shanghai reached 46,161 ha in 2017, and could capture 874 t of PM2.5 with an average of 18.94 kg/ha. There are significant spatial heterogeneities in the role of different forest communities and administrative districts in removing PM2.5. Although PM2.5 removal was relatively harmonized with the human population distribution in terms of space, approximately 57.41% of the urban forest presented low coupling between removal capacity and PM2.5 concentration. Therefore, we propose to plant more trees with high removal capacity of PM2.5 in the western areas of Shanghai, and increase vertical planting in bridge pillars and building walls to compensate the insufficient amount of urban forest in the center area.

TI  - Inconsistency of Global Vegetation Dynamics Driven by Climate Change: Evidences from Spatial Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global greening over the past 30 years since 1980s has been confirmed by numerous studies. However, a single-dimensional indicator and non-spatial modelling approaches might exacerbate uncertainties in our understanding of global change. Thus, comprehensive monitoring for vegetation's various properties and spatially explicit models are required. In this study, we used the newest enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 to detect the inconsistency trend of annual peak and average global vegetation growth using the Mann-Kendall test method. We explored the climatic factors that affect vegetation growth change from 2001 to 2018 using the spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM) and geographically weighted regression model (GWR). The results showed that EVImax and EVImean in global vegetated areas consistently showed linear increasing trends during 2001-2018, with the global averaged trend of 0.0022 yr(-1) (p < 0.05) and 0.0030 yr(-1) (p < 0.05). Greening mainly occurred in the croplands and forests of China, India, North America and Europe, while browning was almost in the grasslands of Brazil and Africa (18.16% vs. 3.08% and 40.73% vs. 2.45%). In addition, 32.47% of the global vegetated area experienced inconsistent trends in EVImax and EVImean. Overall, precipitation and mean temperature had positive impacts on vegetation variation, while potential evapotranspiration and vapour pressure had negative impacts. The GWR revealed that the responses of EVI to climate change were inconsistent in an arid or humid area, in cropland or grassland. Climate change could affect vegetation characteristics by changing plant phenology, consequently rendering the inconsistency between peak and mean greening. In addition, anthropogenic activities, including land cover change and land use management, also could lead to the differences between annual peak and mean vegetation variations.

TI  - Study on Collaborative Emission Reduction in Green-House and Pollutant Gas Due to COVID-19 Lockdown in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, as China's peaking carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution control projects have converged, scholars have begun to focus on the synergistic mechanisms of greenhouse gas and pollution gas reduction. In 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, which led to severe nationwide blockade measures, unexpectedly provided a valuable opportunity to study the synergistic reduction in greenhouse gases and polluting gases. This paper uses a combination of NO2, O-3, and CO2 column concentration products from different satellites and surface concentrations from ground-based stations to investigate potential correlations between these monitoring indicators in four Chinese representative cities. We found that XCO2 decreased in March to varying degrees in different cities. It was witnessed that the largest decrease in CO2, -1.12 ppm, occurred in Wuhan, i.e., the first epicenter of COVID-19. We also analyzed the effects of NO2 and O-3 concentrations on changes in XCO2. First, in 2020, we used a top-down approach to obtain the conclusion that the change amplitude of NO2 concentration in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan were -24%, -18%, -4%, and -39%, respectively. Furthermore, the O-3 concentration increments were 5%, 14%, 12%, and 14%. Second, we used a bottom-up approach to obtain the conclusion that the monthly averaged NO2 concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan in March had the largest changes, changing to -39%, -40%, and -61%, respectively. The corresponding amounts of changes in monthly averaged O-3 concentrations were -14%, -2%, and 9%. However, the largest amount of change in monthly averaged NO2 concentration in Guangzhou was found in December 2020, with a value of -40%. The change in O-3 concentration was -12% in December. Finally, we analyzed the relationship of NO2 and O3 concentrations with XCO2. Moreover, the results show that the effect of NO2 concentration on XCO2 is positively correlated from the point of the satellite (R = 0.4912) and the point of the ground monitoring stations (R = 0.3928). Surprisingly, we found a positive (in satellite observations and R = 0.2391) and negative correlation (in ground monitoring stations and R = 0.3333) between XCO2 and the O-3 concentrations. During the epidemic period, some scholars based on model analysis found that Wuhan's carbon emissions decreased by 16.2% on average. Combined with satellite data, we estimate that Wuhan's XCO2 fell by about 1.12 ppm in February. At last, the government should consider reducing XCO2 and NO2 concentration at the same time to make a synergistic reduction.

TI  - Landslide Detection in the Linzhi-Ya'an Section along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway Based on InSAR and Hot Spot Analysis Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Construction of the 998.64-km Linzhi-Ya'an section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway has been influenced by landslide disasters, threatening the safety of Sichuan-Tibet railway projects. Landslide identification and deformation analysis in this area are urgently needed. In this context, it was the first time that 164 advanced land-observing satellite-2 (ALOS-2) phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar-2 (PALSAR-2) images were collected to detect landslide disasters along the entire Linzhi-Ya'an section. Interferogram stacking and small baseline interferometry methods were used to derive the deformation rate and time-series deformation from 2014-2020. After that, the hot spot analysis method was introduced to conduct spatial clustering analysis of the annual deformation rate, and the effective deformation area was quickly extracted. Finally, 517 landslide disasters along the Linzhi-Ya'an route were detected by integrating observed deformation, Google Earth optical images, and external geological data. The main factors controlling the spatial landslide distribution were analyzed. In the vertical direction, the spatial landslide distribution was mainly concentrated in the elevation range of 3000-5000 m, the slope range of 10-40 degrees, and the aspect of northeast and east. In the horizontal direction, landslides were concentrated near rivers, and were also closely related to earthquake-prone areas, fault zones, and high-precipitation areas. In short, rainfall, freeze-thaw weathering, seismic activity, and fault zones are the main factors inducing landslides along this route. This research provides scientific support for the construction and operation of the Linzhi-Ya'an section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway.

TI  - Precise Orbit Determination for LEO Satellites With Ambiguity Resolution: Improvement and Comparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise knowledge of orbit represents a fundamental requirement for the earth observing satellite missions to achieve their advanced objectives. The integer ambiguity resolution (IAR) has proved to be a key to utmost accuracy in space navigation. Generally, there are two typical IAR methods widely used in the orbit determination of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the classical double-difference (DD) IAR and new single-difference (SD) IAR. Based on one-year observations of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) and Sentinel-3 missions, this study is dedicated to a comprehensive analysis of the differences of the products used, implementation details and ambiguity fixing performance for different IAR methods in LEO precise orbit determination (POD), and discusses how these differences influence the orbit solutions. The results show that the orbit accuracy improvement contributed by the ambiguity fixing varies with the adopted IAR methods. SD IAR can contribute to a representative reduction of 1-4 mm in satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals compared to the float solutions. The application of bias products from different analysis centers leads to marginal differences for the ambiguity fixing. For DD IAR method, the different ways to form the double-difference ambiguity yield different performances in POD. The DD IAR of space-ground baselines can achieve a comparable performance to SD IAR, while the benefit of ambiguity fixing is largely weakened when forming space-space baseline. Furthermore, we also analyze the contribution of the ambiguity fixing to the accuracy and robustness of the kinematic orbit and discuss its great potential for the future applications.

TI  - Identifying Potential Landslides by Stacking-InSAR in Southwestern China and Its Performance Comparison with SBAS-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide disasters occur frequently in the mountainous areas in southwest China, which pose serious threats to the local residents. Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides us the ability to identify active slopes as potential landslides in vast mountainous areas, to help prevent and mitigate the disasters. Quickly and accurately identifying potential landslides based on massive SAR data is of great significance. Taking the national highway near Wenchuan County, China, as study area, this paper used a Stacking-InSAR method to quickly and qualitatively identify potential landslides based on a total of 40 Sentinel SAR images acquired from November 2017 to March 2019. As a result, 72 active slopes were successfully detected as potential landslides. By comparing the results from Stacking-InSAR with the results from the traditional SBAS-InSAR (Small Baselines Subset) time series method, it was found that the two methods had a high consistency, with 81.7% potential landslides identified by both of the two methods. A detailed comparison on the detection differences was performed, revealing that Stacking-InSAR, compared to SBAS-InSAR may miss a few active slopes with small spatial scales, small displacement levels and the ones affected by the atmosphere, while it has good performance on poor-coherence regions, with the advantages of low technical requirements and low computation labor. The Stacking-InSAR method would be a fast and powerful method to qualitatively and effectively identify potential landslides in vast mountainous areas, with a comprehensive understanding of its specialty and limitations.

TI  - ERTFM: An Effective Model to Fuse Chinese GF-1 and MODIS Reflectance Data for Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coarse spatial resolution sensors play a major role in capturing temporal variation, as satellite images that capture fine spatial scales have a relatively long revisit cycle. The trade-off between the revisit cycle and spatial resolution hinders the access of terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) data with both fine spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we firstly investigated the capability of an Extremely Randomized Trees Fusion Model (ERTFM) to reconstruct high spatiotemporal resolution reflectance data from a fusion of the Chinese GaoFen-1 (GF-1) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. Then, based on the merged reflectance data, we used a Modified-Satellite Priestley-Taylor (MS-PT) algorithm to generate LE products at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Our results illustrated that the ERTFM-based reflectance estimates showed close similarity with observed GF-1 images and the predicted NDVI agreed well with observed NDVI at two corresponding dates (r = 0.76 and 0.86, respectively). In comparison with other four fusion methods, including the widely used spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and the enhanced STARFM, ERTFM had the best performance in terms of predicting reflectance (SSIM = 0.91; r = 0.77). Further analysis revealed that LE estimates using ERTFM-based data presented more detailed spatiotemporal characteristics and provided close agreement with site-level LE observations, with an R-2 of 0.81 and an RMSE of 19.18 W/m(2). Our findings suggest that the ERTFM can be used to improve LE estimation with high frequency and high spatial resolution, meaning that it has great potential to support agricultural monitoring and irrigation management.

TI  - Recent Changes of Glacial Lakes in the High Mountain Asia and Its Potential Controlling Factors Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current glacial lake datasets in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region still need to be improved because their boundary divisions in the land-water transition zone are not precisely delineate, and also some very small glacial lakes have been lost due to their mixed reflectance with backgrounds. In addition, most studies have only focused on the changes in the area of a glacial lake as a whole, but do not involve the actual changes of per pixel on its boundary and the potential controlling factors. In this research, we produced more accurate and complete maps of glacial lake extent in the HMA in 2008, 2012, and 2016 with consistent time intervals using Landsat satellite images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, and further studied the formation, distribution, and dynamics of the glacial lakes. In total, 17,016 and 21,249 glacial lakes were detected in 2008 and 2016, respectively, covering an area of 1420.15 +/- 232.76 km(2) and 1577.38 +/- 288.82 km(2); the lakes were mainly located at altitudes between 4400 m and 5600 m. The annual areal expansion rate was approximately 1.38% from 2008 to 2016. To explore the cause of the rapid expansion of individual glacial lakes, we investigated their long-term expansion rates by measuring changes in shoreline positions. The results show that glacial lakes are expanding rapidly in areas close to glaciers and had a high expansion rate of larger than 20 m/yr from 2008 to 2016. Glacial lakes in the Himalayas showed the highest expansion rate of more than 2 m/yr, followed by the Karakoram Mountains (1.61 m/yr) and the Tianshan Mountains (1.52 m/yr). The accelerating rate of glacier ice and snow melting caused by global warming is the primary contributor to glacial lake growth. These results may provide information that will help in the understanding of detailed lake dynamics and the mechanism, and also facilitate the scientific recognition of the potential hazards associated with glacial lakes in this region.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Remote Sensing for Mapping Plucking Area of Tea Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping plucking areas of tea plantations is essential for tea plantation management and production estimation. However, on-ground survey methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and satellite-based remotely sensed data are not fine enough for plucking area mapping that is 0.5-1.5 m in width. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) remote sensing can provide an alternative. This paper explores the potential of using UAV-derived remotely sensed data for identifying plucking areas of tea plantations. In particular, four classification models were built based on different UAV data (optical imagery, digital aerial photogrammetry, and lidar data). The results indicated that the integration of optical imagery and lidar data produced the highest overall accuracy using the random forest algorithm (94.39%), while the digital aerial photogrammetry data could be an alternative to lidar point clouds with only a similar to 3% accuracy loss. The plucking area of tea plantations in the Huashan Tea Garden was accurately measured for the first time with a total area of 6.41 ha, which accounts for 57.47% of the tea garden land. The most important features required for tea plantation mapping were the canopy height, variances of heights, blue band, and red band. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted. The novelty of this study is that it is the first specific exploration of UAV remote sensing in mapping plucking areas of tea plantations, demonstrating it to be an accurate and cost-effective method, and hence represents an advance in remote sensing of tea plantations.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Quantification of the Summer Maize Yield Gap Induced by Suboptimum Sowing Dates over North China Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating yield potential (Yp) and quantifying the contribution of suboptimum field managements to the yield gap (Yg) of crops are important for improving crop yield effectively. However, achieving this goal on a regional scale remains difficult because of challenges in collecting field management information. In this study, we retrieved crop management information (i.e., emerging stage information and a surrogate of sowing date (SDT)) from a remote sensing (RS) vegetation index time series. Then, we developed a new approach to quantify maize Yp, total Yg, and the suboptimum SDT-induced Yg (Yg(0)) using a process-based RS-driven crop yield model for maize (PRYM-Maize), which was developed in our previous study. PRYM-Maize and the newly developed method were used over the North China Plain (NCP) to estimate Ya, Yp, Yg, and Yg(0) of summer maize. Results showed that PRYM-Maize outputs reasonable estimates for maize yield over the NCP, with correlations and root mean standard deviation of 0.49 +/- 0.24 and 0.88 +/- 0.14 t hm(-2), respectively, for modeled annual maize yields versus the reference value for each year over the period 2010 to 2015 on a city level. Yp estimated using our new method can reasonably capture the spatial variations in site-level estimates from crop growth models in previous literature. The mean annual regional Yp of 2010-2015 was estimated to be 11.99 t hm(-2), and a Yg value of 5.4 t hm(-2) was found between Yp and Ya on a regional scale. An estimated 29-42% of regional Yg in each year (2010-2015) was induced by suboptimum SDT. Results also show that not all Yg(0) was persistent over time. Future studies using high spatial-resolution RS images to disaggregate Yg(0) into persistent and non-persistent components on a small scale are required to increase maize yield over the NCP.

TI  - A 17 GHz direct digital synthesizer in a InP DHBT technology
T2  - SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct digital synthesizer (DDS) is an essential part of the multi-band digital phased array radar system due to its broad frequency generation ability. In this paper, a 17 GHz 8-bit ROM-less DDS in a 0.7 mu m InP double hetero-junction bipolar transistor (DHBT) technology is presented. The DDS adopts a sin-weighted nonlinear Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to achieve phase-to-amplitude conversion. A simplified pipelined phase accumulator is applied, and its adder is designed according to the majority decision algorithm to reduce power consumption. The DDS is fabricated in an in-house 0.7 mu m InP DHBT technology. The measured results demonstrate that the maximum input clock frequency is 17 GHz, and it can synthesize sin-wave outputs from 66.41 MHz to 8.5 GHz in 66.41 MHz steps. The average Spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) for the output signal of the DDS is - 18.1 dBc. The chip integrates about 1700 transistors, consumes 7.4 W, and has a Figure of merit (FOM) of 2.3 GHz/W.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Active Fires in the Arctic Region during 2001-2019 and a Fire Risk Assessment Model
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing frequency of active fires worldwide has caused significant impacts on terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems. Polar regions have received little attention due to their sparse populations, but active fires in the Arctic cause carbon losses from peatlands, which affects the global climate system. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the spatiotemporal variations in active fires in the Arctic and to assess the fire risk. We used MODIS C6 data from 2001 to 2019 and VIIRS V1 data from 2012 to 2019 to analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of active fires and establish a fire risk assessment model based on logistic regression. The trends in active fire frequency based on MODIS C6 and VIIRS V1 data are consistent. Throughout the Arctic, the fire frequency appears to be fluctuating and overall increasing. Fire occurrence has obvious seasonality, being concentrated in summer (June-August) and highest in July, when lightning is most frequent. The frequency of active fires is related to multiple factors, such as vegetation type, NDVI, elevation, slope, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and distances from roads and settlements. A risk assessment model was constructed based on logistic regression and found to be accurate. The results are helpful in understanding the risk of fires in the Arctic under climate change and provide a scientific basis for fire prediction and control and for reducing fire-related carbon emissions.

TI  - Landscape Pattern Evolution Processes and the Driving Forces in the Wetlands of Lake Baiyangdian
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal features of land use changes and the evolution process of landscape pattern from 1980 to 2017 were investigated using historical satellite images from a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for 1980, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2017 in the wetlands of Lake Baiyangdian in the North China Plain (NCP). Landscape pattern indices were used to quantify landscape changes in wetlands, and a redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to analyze the driving forces and quantitatively explain the effects of human activities and natural changes on wetland fragmentation. The results showed that the total wetland area was 234.4 km(2) in 1980 but it decreased by 8.1% at an average decrease rate of 0.5 km(2) per year. The dominant transition between land use types was from natural wetlands to artificial wetlands, and wetland conversion to dry land and residential land. The RDA results suggested that agricultural activities and total population were the main driving factors affecting wetland landscape. Additionally, climate change provided a potentially favorable environment for agricultural development, due to the increased temperatures and decreased wind speeds. Additionally, governmental policy changes and dam construction also played the roles in land use changes.

TI  - Influence of Land Use Change on the Surface Albedo and Climate Change in the Qinling-Daba Mountains
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes affect the surface radiative budget and energy balance by changing the surface albedo, which generates radiative forcing, impacting the regional and global climate. To estimate the effect of land use changes on the surface albedo and climate change in a mountainous area with complex terrain, we obtained MODIS data, identified the spatial-temporal characteristics of the surface albedo caused by land use changes, and then calculated the radiative forcing based on solar radiative data and the surface albedo in the Qinling-Daba mountains from 2000 to 2015. The correlation between the land use changes and the radiative forcing was analyzed to explore the climate effects caused by land use changes on a kilometer-grid scale in the Qinling-Daba mountains. Our results show that the primarily land use changes were a decrease in the cultivated land area and an increase in the construction land area, as well as other conversions between six land use types from 2000 to 2015. The land use changes led to significant changes in the surface albedo. Meanwhile, the radiative forcing caused by the land use had different magnitudes, strengths, and occurrence ranges, resulting in both warming and cooling climate change effects.

TI  - GIS-Based Forest Fire Risk Model: A Case Study in Laoshan National Forest Park, Nanjing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire risk prediction is significant for fire prevention and fire resource allocation. Fire risk maps are effective methods for quantifying regional fire risk. Laoshan National Forest Park has many precious natural resources and tourist attractions, but there is no fire risk assessment model. This paper aims to construct the forest fire risk map for Nanjing Laoshan National Forest Park. The forest fire risk model is constructed by factors (altitude, aspect, topographic wetness index, slope, distance to roads and populated areas, normalized difference vegetation index, and temperature) which have a great influence on the probability of inducing fire in Laoshan. Since the importance of factors in different study areas is inconsistent, it is necessary to calculate the significance of each factor of Laoshan. After the significance calculation is completed, the fire risk model of Laoshan can be obtained. Then, the fire risk map can be plotted based on the model. This fire risk map can clarify the fire risk level of each part of the study area, with 16.97% extremely low risk, 48.32% low risk, 17.35% moderate risk, 12.74% high risk and 4.62% extremely high risk, and it is compared with the data of MODIS fire anomaly point. The result shows that the accuracy of the risk map is 76.65%.

TI  - Drought Monitoring over Yellow River Basin from 2003-2019 Using Reconstructed MODIS Land Surface Temperature in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most complex and least-understood environmental disasters that can trigger environmental, societal, and economic problems. To accurately assess the drought conditions in the Yellow River Basin, this study reconstructed the Land Surface Temperature (LST) using the Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) model and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), which are four typical remote sensing drought indices, were calculated. Then, the air temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture data were used to evaluate the applicability of each drought index to different land types. Finally, this study characterized the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in the Yellow River Basin from 2003 to 2019. The results show that: (1) Using the LST reconstructed by the ATC model to calculate the drought index can effectively improve the accuracy of drought monitoring. In most areas, the reconstructed TCI, VHI, and TVDI are more reliable for monitoring drought conditions than the unreconstructed VCI. (2) The four drought indices (TCI, VCI, VH, TVDI) represent the same temporal and spatial patterns throughout the study area. However, in some small areas, the temporal and spatial patterns represented by different drought indices are different. (3) In the Yellow River Basin, the drought level is highest in the northwest and lowest in the southwest and southeast. The dry conditions in the Yellow River Basin were stable from 2003 to 2019. The results in this paper provide a basis for better understanding and evaluating the drought conditions in the Yellow River Basin and can guide water resources management, agricultural production, and ecological protection of this area.

TI  - Efficient and Flexible Aggregation and Distribution of MODIS Atmospheric Products Based on Climate Analytics as a Service Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument onboard NASA's Terra (launched in 1999) and Aqua (launched in 2002) satellite missions as part of the more extensive Earth Observation System (EOS). By measuring the reflection and emission by the Earth-Atmosphere system in 36 spectral bands from the visible to thermal infrared with near-daily global coverage and high-spatial-resolution (250 m similar to 1 km at nadir), MODIS is playing a vital role in developing validated, global, interactive Earth system models. MODIS products are processed into three levels, i.e., Level-1 (L1), Level-2 (L2) and Level-3 (L3). To shift the current static and "one-size-fits-all" data provision method of MODIS products, in this paper, we propose a service-oriented flexible and efficient MODIS aggregation framework. Using this framework, users only need to get aggregated MODIS L3 data based on their unique requirements and the aggregation can run in parallel to achieve a speedup. The experiments show that our aggregation results are almost identical to the current MODIS L3 products and our parallel execution with 8 computing nodes can work 88.63 times faster than a serial code execution on a single node.

TI  - A Study on the Flux of Total Suspended Matter in the Padma River in Bangladesh Based on Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The flux of total suspended matter (TSM), F-TSM, output by several large rivers in Asia, has been in decline due to human activities. As the estuary of the Ganges-Brahmaputra River, the Padma River transports a significant amount of suspended matter (SM) to the Bay of Bengal each year. In this study, the TSM concentration (C-TSM) and F-TSM in the Padma River in the period 1991-2019 were calculated based on the data acquired by the Landsat series satellites and an empirical TSM algorithm model for large, high-turbidity rivers. The results showed that the maximum and minimum F-TSM values (318 +/- 62 and 73 +/- 29 mt, respectively) in the Padma River occurred in 2011 and 2015, respectively. On average, F-TSM in the Padma River decreased at an annual rate of 3.3 mt (p < 0.01). The impact of human activities on C-TSM contributed more significantly to the changes in F-TSM (R = 0.76) than natural factors (R = 0.44). Due to a lack of water conservancy facilities within the river basin, changes in the water and soil retention capacity due to the changes in vegetation coverage were an important human factor (R = -0.79).

M3  - Article
AB  - The Spanish collection of the Stroganov Library reveals Spain as a country with a rich cultural heritage. The last owner of the family library, G.A. Stroganov, was the Russian ambassador to Spain, and his interest in Spanish subjects was reflected in the book collection. One of the most valuable publications is a series of engraved portraits of outstanding Spaniards, published from 1791 to 1819. As a cultural time-specific project of the Enlightenment era, this series reveals the value priorities of Spanish society, which allows us to understand its socio-cultural guidelines over a long historical period. An impressive share of the persons selected by the Spaniards among their outstanding representatives belongs to university figures. This speaks not only about the influence of the Age of Enlightenment, but also about the rich history of university tradition in Spain.The subject of our study is the figure of the Spanish humanist H. Nunez de Guzman (1475-1553). In his youth, he studied with Nebrija. In the College of St. Clement in Bologna he started studying the culture of classical Greece. After returning to Spain, he studied Hebrew and Arabic in Granada. He was invited by Cisneros to the University of Alcala to work on a project to create a multilingual Bible. At this university, which became an important center of Spanish humanism, he taught rhetoric and Greek. In 1524, he received a chair of Greek at the University of Salamanca, where he also taught Latin, rhetoric, and lectured on the "Natural History" of Pliny. In Salamanca, Nunez published commentaries on the works of Seneca (1529), Mela (1543) and Pliny (1544); he prepared a collection of proverbs in the Castilian language, which was published in 1555. A deep connoisseur of Latin and Greek, Nunez is considered the patriarch of the Spanish Hellenists. They were a cohort of humanists who, on Spanish soil, combined in their worldview the features of the outgoing Middle Ages and the ideas of the Renaissance. Nunez played a significant role in the development of the Greek language as a subject of study in Spanish universities. The Greek language, the knowledge of which nourished and developed humanistic upbringing and education, gets its spread in Spain during the life and activity of Nunez.In the series of portraits of outstanding Spaniards, the portrait of Nunez is placed in the fourteenth notebook, published in 1802.The engraved portrait is made by Esquivel according to the drawing of Engidanos. Nunez is depicted sitting in nature with an open book in his hands. In the biography attached to the portrait, it is noted that "few have more reason to be included in the list of outstanding people than Fernando Nunez de Guzman. His character, his erudition and behavior are an example of the highest honor."Nunez donated his valuable collection of books in Latin and Greek to the University of Salamanca. Nunez remains interesting for researchers today. The image and selfless devotion of the erudite continue to evoke deep respect, and the legacy left - gratitude.

TI  - Rapid glacier Shrinkage and Glacial Lake Expansion of a China-Nepal Transboundary Catchment in the Central Himalayas, between 1964 and 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming and concomitant glacier recession in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) have led to widespread development and expansion of glacial lakes, which reserved the freshwater resource, but also may increase risks of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) or debris floods. Using 46 moderate- and high-resolution satellite images, including declassified Keyhole and Landsat missions between 1964 and 2020, we provide a comprehensive area mapping of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Tama Koshi (Rongxer) basin, a highly glacierized China-Nepal transnational catchment in the central Himalayas with high potential risks of glacier-related hazards. Results show that the 329.2 +/- 1.9 km(2) total area of 271 glaciers in the region has decreased by 26.2 +/- 3.2 km(2) in the past 56 years. During 2000-2016, remarkable ice mass loss caused the mean glacier surface elevation to decrease with a rate of -0.63 m a(-1), and the mean glacier surface velocity slowed by similar to 25% between 1999 and 2015. The total area of glacial lakes increased by 9.2 +/- 0.4 km(2) (similar to 180%) from 5.1 +/- 0.1 km(2) in 1964 to 14.4 +/- 0.3 km(2) in 2020, while ice-contacted proglacial lakes have a much higher expansion rate (similar to 204%). Large-scale glacial lakes are developed preferentially and experienced rapid expansion on the east side of the basin, suggesting that in addition to climate warming, the glacial geomorphological characters (aspect and slope) are also key controlling factors of the lake growing process. We hypothesize that lake expansion will continue in some cases until critical local topography (i.e., steepening icefall) is reached, but the lake number may not necessarily increase. Further monitoring should be focused on eight rapidly expanding proglacial lakes due to their high potential risks of failure and relatively high lake volumes.

TI  - Primary Melanoma Characteristics of Metastatic Disease: A Nationwide Cancer Registry Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Melanoma of the skin is the most lethal form of skin cancer. Almost 40% of the patients who die of metastatic melanoma did not have metastases at first diagnosis. More knowledge about patient and tumour characteristics as well as patterns of disease progression is needed. We described the characteristics and disease patterns of early-stage melanomas that progress into metastatic disease. We observed that more than half of the patients with metastases were initially diagnosed with early-stage disease. Additionally, we found that melanomas in some specific body sites were likely to metastasize to certain organs. Our finding that a substantial proportion of patients with metastases were initially diagnosed with early-stage disease highlights the need to investigate who these high-risk patients are. The characteristics and disease patterns of primary stage I and II cutaneous melanomas that progress to stage III or IV disease were investigated based on data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Data on stage III or IV melanomas at first diagnosis or during follow-up between 2017 and 2019 were retrieved. Patient and primary tumour characteristics were investigated in relation to time to disease progression and the number of organ sites with metastatic disease using regression models. In total, 2763 patients were included, of whom 1613 were diagnosed with stage IV disease. Among the patients with stage IV disease, 60% (n = 963) were initially diagnosed with stage I or II disease. The proportion of patients who received a sentinel lymph node biopsy increased after the introduction of adjuvant therapy in 2019 from 61% to 87%. Among all patients with stage III disease who were eligible for adjuvant systemic therapy (n = 453) after 2019, 37% were not treated with this therapy. Among patients with stage IV disease, lung metastases were most often detected as the first metastatic site and females presented with more metastatic sites than males. Most patient and primary tumour characteristics were not associated with the distant metastatic organ site, except melanoma localisation in the lower extremities and the head or neck. Our observation that most stage IV patients were initially diagnosed with early-stage disease highlights the need for more accurate risk prediction models.

TI  - Optimal Regularization Method Based on the L-Curve for Solving Rational Function Model Parameters
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rational polynomial coefficients in a rational function model (RFM) have high correlation and redundancy, especially in high-order RFMs, which results in ill-posed problems of the normal equation. For this reason, this article presents an optimal regularization method with the L-curve for solving rational polynomial coefficients. This method estimates the rational polynomial coefficients of an RFM using the L-curve and finds the optimal regularization parameter with the minimum mean square error, then solves the parameters of the RFM by the Tikhonov method based on the optimal regularization parameter. The proposed method is validated in both terrain-dependent and terrain-independent cases using Gaofen-1 and aerial images, respectively, and compared with the least-squares method, L-curve method, and generalized cross-validation method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can solve the RFM parameters effectively, and their accuracy is increased by more than 85% on average relative to the other methods.

TI  - Identification and spatial pattern analysis of alpine timberline by remote sensing methods in Yarlung Zangpo Grand Canyon
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important ecotone, the alpine timberline is the boundary between closed-canopy montane forest and alpine vegetation, and is highly sensitive to global and regional climate changes. We provided a way to identify and extract the alpine timberline in Yarlung Zangpo Grand Canyon Nature Reserve by using remote sensing data and spatial analysis based on land use/land cover classification and NDVI distribution characteristics. Combining DEM data, the influence of slope and aspect on the distribution of alpine timberline was explored. The results showed that the alpine timberline in Yarlung Zangpo Grand Canyon is transitional timberline, with the upper boundary approximately distributed at the elevation of 3422-4373 m, the lower boundary at approximately 3270-4164 m, with a width of about 110-280 m. Alpine timberline was mainly distributed on steep and very steep slopes ranging from 25 degrees to 45 degrees. The maximum elevation of both the upper and lower boundaries occurred on steep slopes. The distribution of alpine timberline varies with aspects, with sunny slopes having a higher boundary than shady slopes.

TI  - Long-Term Changes in the Land-Ocean Ecological Environment in Small Island Countries in the South Pacific: A Fiji Vision
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small island countries in the South Pacific are ecologically fragile areas, vulnerable to climate change, and the long-term ecological changes in the sea and land have an important impact on their sustainable development. This study takes Fiji, a typical small island country in the South Pacific, as an example, to analyze the change and connection of marine and terrestrial ecosystem environments based on 30 years of multi-source, satellite, remote-sensing data. From 1991 to 2019, according to the change in forest area in Fiji, three stages were delineated: first was a period of stability, then a decrease, and then a recovery in recent years. From 1991 to 2002, Fiji's vegetation accounted for 73% of the total area; sea environment surrounding the islands, such as sea level height and sea surface temperature, were relatively low, with high water transparency. From 2002 to 2014, with the development of forestry and tourism, vegetation decreased by 6.89% and bare land increased, which changes the runoff erosion in the drainage basin; correspondingly, the chlorophyll a concentration in three major estuaries was found to be slightly increased with low water transparency. Meanwhile, coupled with the rising sea temperature, the area of Fiji's coral reefs shrank significantly, with 51.13% of the total loss of coral reefs occurring in the Vanua Levu, where bare land and runoff were more distributed in its drainage basin. From 2014 to 2019, Fiji's vegetation and coral reef areas recovered from the former stage; affected by short-term climate oscillations such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the sea surface temperature showed a significant abnormal drop and the water transparency decreased. In the past 30 years (1993-2018), the sea level rise rate around Fiji reached 4 mm/year, and the temperature increased by 0.3 degrees C, which threatens the coastal ecosystem environment, including coral reefs and mangrove; inappropriate land-use change would worsen the situation in these ecologically fragile areas.

TI  - A Matrix Completion Based Method for RFI Source Localization in Microwave Interferometric Radiometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA) is aimed to globally monitor the Earth surface moisture and ocean salinity. As the single payload of SMOS satellite, the Microwave Interferometric Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) operates in the protected L-band. Nonetheless, the artificial sources emitting close to or/and fully in this band are contaminating the collected remote sensing data and deteriorating the performance of the SMOS mission. Identifying and localizing such sources is crucial to improve the quality of SMOS scientific products. In this article, we propose a method based on matrix completion (MC) for localization of radio frequency interference (RFI) sources. This method mainly exploits the low-rank property of the augmented covariance matrix (ACM) of the sparse array and addresses the ACM incompleteness (i.e., sampling data loss) due to inherent array geometry (e.g., the SMOS Y-shaped array) or potential hardware malfunction (e.g., the correlator failure). Validation results show that, compared with existing RFI localization approaches such as the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) inversion and covariance-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, the proposed MC method possesses competitive localization accuracy, superior spatial resolution, and reduced artifacts.

TI  - Analysis of Temporal and Spatial Variability of Fronts on the Amery Ice Shelf Automatically Detected Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) dynamics and mass balance caused by iceberg calving and basal melting are significant in the ocean climate system. Using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 SAR, we monitored the temporal and spatial variability of the frontal positions on the Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica, from 2015 to 2021. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm based on the SO-CFAR strategy and a profile cumulative method for frontal line extraction. To improve the accuracy of the extracted frontal lines, we developed a framework combining the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and morphological image-processing strategies. A visual comparison between the proposed algorithm and state-of-the-art algorithm shows that our algorithm is effective in these cases including rifts, icebergs, and crevasses as well as ice-shelf surface structures. We present a detailed analysis of the temporal and spatial variability of fronts on AIS that we find, an advance of the AIS frontal line before the D28 calving event, and a continuous advance after the event. The study reveals that the AIS extent has been advanced at the rate of 1015 m/year. Studies have shown that the frontal location of AIS has continuously expanded. From March 2015 to May 2021, the frontal location of AIS expanded by 6.5 km; while the length of the AIS frontal line is relatively different after the D28 event, the length of the frontal line increased by about 7.5% during 2015 and 2021 (255.03 km increased to 273.5 km). We found a substantial increase in summer advance rates and a decrease in winter advance rates with the seasonal characteristics. We found this variability of the AIS frontal line to be in good agreement with the ice flow velocity.

TI  - An Innovative Method for the Spatial Sampling Analysis of Sea Surface Temperature in the Pacific-Indian Oceans
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a pragmatic approach is presented for evaluating the spatial representativeness of the point-scale drifting buoy sea-surface temperature (SST) over the joined area of Asia and the Pacific-Indian Ocean with that help of the highresolution satellite-derived SST at multipixel scales. The relative spatial sampling error (RSSE) and coefficient of sill (CS) are selected to investigate consistency between the drifting buoy SST and pixel mean value of satellite-derived SST and representativeness of drifting buoy SST at pixel scales of 25 km, 50 km, and 100 km, respectively. The results show that at the 25-km scale, the consistency between the drifting buoy SST and the satellite-derived SST is high, and the spatial heterogeneity within the pixel scale is not obvious, i.e. only two measurements with RSSE are larger than the critical value of all 43,748 measurements. But with the increase in the scale, the number of the drifting buoy SST, which is inconsistent with the satellite-derived SST, is obviously increased (the number of the inconsistent point measurement at the scale of 50 km increased to 42, and at the scale of 100 km it is 59), and the spatial heterogeneity is enhanced. This spatial variation along the direction of latitude change is more obvious. Combining spatial consistency and spatial heterogeneity, no pointscale measurements of the worst spatial representativeness occur at the 25-km pixel scale, in which RSSE and CS are above the critical value. Although drifting buoy SST keeps a high consistency with satellite-derived SST, there are measurements of obvious local variation within pixel scales, and this variation is more obvious along the direction of latitude change. The spatial representativeness of the drifting buoy SST is unstable. This method is helpful to remove the poor-quality reference points during the validation of satellite-derived products, taking point-scale measurements as reference.

TI  - Mapping Multi-Temporal Population Distribution in China from 1985 to 2010 Using Landsat Images via Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of the population is fundamental in a wide range of fields, including resource management, disaster response, public health, and urban planning. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals also require the accurate and timely assessment of where people live to formulate, implement, and monitor sustainable development policies. However, due to the lack of appropriate auxiliary datasets and effective methodological frameworks, there are rarely continuous multi-temporal gridded population data over a long historical period to aid in our understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution of the population. In this study, we developed a framework integrating a ResNet-N deep learning architecture, considering neighborhood effects with a vast number of Landsat-5 images from Google Earth Engine for population mapping, to overcome both the data and methodology obstacles associated with rapid multi-temporal population mapping over a long historical period at a large scale. Using this proposed framework in China, we mapped fine-scale multi-temporal gridded population data (1 km x 1 km) of China for the 1985-2010 period with a 5-year interval. The produced multi-temporal population data were validated with available census data and achieved comparable performance. By analyzing the multi-temporal population grids, we revealed the spatiotemporal evolution of population distribution from 1985 to 2010 in China with the characteristic of concentration of the population in big cities and the contraction of small- and medium-sized cities. The framework proposed in this study demonstrates the feasibility of mapping multi-temporal gridded population distribution at a large scale over a long period in a timely and low-cost manner, which is particularly useful in low-income and data-poor areas.

TI  - Improving Ensemble Volcanic Ash Forecasts by Direct Insertion of Satellite Data and Ensemble Filtering
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved quantitative forecasts of volcanic ash are in great demand by the aviation industry to enable better risk management during disruptive volcanic eruption events. However, poor knowledge of volcanic source parameters and other dispersion and transport modelling uncertainties, such as those due to errors in numerical weather prediction fields, make this problem very challenging. Nonetheless, satellite-based algorithms that retrieve ash properties, such as mass load, effective radius, and cloud top height, combined with inverse modelling techniques, such as ensemble filtering, can significantly ameliorate these problems. The satellite-retrieved data can be used to better constrain the volcanic source parameters, but they can also be used to avoid the description of the volcanic source altogether by direct insertion into the forecasting model. In this study we investigate the utility of the direct insertion approach when employed within an ensemble filtering framework. Ensemble members are formed by initializing dispersion models with data from different timesteps, different values of cloud top height, thickness, and NWP ensemble members. This large ensemble is then filtered with respect to observations to produce a refined forecast. We apply this approach to 14 different eruption case studies in the tropical atmosphere. We demonstrate that the direct insertion of data improves model forecast skill, particularly when it is used in a hybrid ensemble in which some ensemble members are initialized from the volcanic source. Moreover, good forecast skill can be obtained even when detailed satellite retrievals are not available, which is frequently the case for volcanic eruptions in the tropics.

TI  - Quantification of Urban Sprawl for Past-To-Future in Abha City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given that many cities in Saudi Arabia have been observing rapid urbanization since the 1990s, scarce studies on the spatial pattern of urban expansion in Saudi Arabia have been conducted. Therefore, the present study investigates the evidence of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and urban sprawl in Abha City of Saudi Arabia, which has been experiencing rapid urbanization, from the past to the future using novel and sophisticated methods. The SVM classifier was used in this study to classify the LULC maps for 1990, 2000, and 2018. The LULC dynamics between 1990-2000, 2000-2018, and 1990-2018 have been analyzed using delta (Delta) change and the Markovian transitional probability matrix. Urban sprawl or urban expansion was modeled using two approaches, such as landscape fragmentation and presence frequency for the first time. The future LULC map for 2028 was predicted using the artificial neural network-cellular automata model (ANN-CA). Future LULC was analyzed using landscape fragmentation and frequency approaches. The results of LULC maps showed that urban areas increased by 334.4% between 1990 and 2018. The Delta change rate showed that 16.34% in urban areas has increased since 1990. While, the transitional probability matrix between 1990 and 2018 reported that the built-up area is the largest stable LULC, having an 83.6% transitional probability value. While 17.9%, 21.8%, 12.4%, and 10.5% of agricultural land, scrubland, exposed rocks, and water bodies were transformed into built-up areas. Urban sprawl models showed that 139 km(2) of new urban areas had been set up in 2018, 49 and 69 km(2) in 1990 and 2000. Furthermore, in 2018, more than 200% of urban areas were stabilized or became core urban areas. The future LULC map (2028) showed that the built-up area would be 343.72 km(2), followed by scrubland (342.98 km(2)) and sparse vegetation (89.96 km(2)). The new urban area in 2028 would be 169 km(2). The authorities and planners should focus more on the sustainable development of urban areas; otherwise, it would harm the natural and urban environment.

TI  - Flood forecasting using quantitative precipitation forecasts and hydrological modeling in the Sebeya catchment, Rwanda
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The absence of a viable flood early warning system for the Sebeya River catchment continues to impede government efforts toward improving community preparedness, the reduction of flood impacts and relief. This paper reports on a recent study that used satellite data, quantitative precipitation forecasts and the rainfall-runoff model for short-term flood forecasting in the Sebeya catchment. The global precipitation measurement product was used as a satellite rainfall product for model calibration and validation and forecasted European Centre Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) rainfall products were evaluated to forecast flood. Model performance was evaluated by the visual examination of simulated hydrographs, observed hydrographs and a number of performance indicators. The real-time flow forecast assessment was conducted with respect to three different flood warning threshold levels for a 3-24-h lead time. The result for a 3-h lead time showed 72% of hits, 7.5% of false alarms and 9.5% of missed forecasts. The number of hits decreased, as the lead time increased. This study did not consider the uncertainties in observed data, and this can influence the model performance. This work provides a base for future studies to establish a viable flood early warning system in the study area and beyond.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events (floods and droughts) are one of the most significance consequences of the climate change and their monitoring is therefore essential in many fields. However, the number of the global in situ discharge measurements has been declining since the eighties and the global supply of available data is often restricted in many parts of world. All these reasons have fostered in the last decades the exploitation of new technologies, such as satellite data, in the estimation of river discharge. In this study, satellite altimetry water level data are used to set-up a consistent and up-to-date river discharge dataset by means of rating curves for different sites across the world. Long continuous river discharge time series so obtained are used to perform a trend analysis on extreme hydrological events. Specifically, peak-over threshold values are extracted from the discharge time series, as proxy variables of independent extreme events, and the trend analysis is then carried out to identify changes in the magnitude of extreme events.The analysis permits to identify areas of the world prone to floods, like the West Africa, or drought so that appropriate actions for disaster risk mitigation and continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, response and recovery practices can be adopted.

TI  - On the role of aerosol radiative effect in the wet season onset timing over the Congo rainforest during boreal autumn
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The boreal summer dry season length is reported to have been increasing in the last 3 decades over the Congo rainforest, which is the second-largest rainforest in the world. In some years, the wet season in boreal autumn starts early, while in others it arrives late. The mechanism behind such a change in the wet season onset date has not been investigated yet. Using multi-satellite data sets, we discover that the variation in aerosols in the dry season plays a major role in determining the subsequent wet season onset. Dry season aerosol optical depth (AOD) influences the strength of the southern African easterly jet (AEJ-S) and, thus, the onset of the wet season. Higher AOD associated with a higher dust mass flux reduces the net downward shortwave radiation and decreases the surface temperature over the Congo rainforest region, leading to a stronger meridional temperature gradient between the rainforest and the Kalahari Desert as early as in June. The latter, in turn, strengthens the AEJ-S, sets in an early and a stronger easterly flow, and leads to a stronger equatorward convergence and an early onset of the wet season in late August to early September. The mean AOD in the dry season over the region is strongly correlated (r = 0.7) with the timing of the subsequent wet season onset. Conversely, in low AOD years, the onset of the wet season over the Congo basin is delayed to mid-October.

TI  - Changes of the spatial and temporal characteristics of land-use landscape patterns using multi-temporal Landsat satellite data: A case study of Zhoushan Island, China
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The research on the changes of the spatial and temporal characteristics of land-use landscape patterns can deeply insight the movement of the Earth's surface by human activities, natural factors, and biological factors in time and space. This paper uses Landsat data for eight periods from 1984 to 2020 to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of the land-use landscape pattern. First, the remotely sensed data were pre-processed. Then, the supervised classification was performed using the maximum likelihood-based method to obtain the information about the land-use and land cover changes in the study area, and an accuracy evaluation was carried out. Finally, the analysis of gravity center movement for the land-use type landscape pattern was carried out. The research results show that the construction land increased from 18.19 km2 in 1984 to 115.97 km2 in 2020. The forest land decreased from 205.72 km2 in 1984 to 194.39 km2 in 2020. The water bodies increased from 5.51 km2 in 1984 to 12.60 km2 in 2020. The mudflats decreased from 19.24 km2 in 1984 to 13.73 km2 in 2020. The cropland/ grassland decreased from 210.98 km2 in 1984 to 203.87 km2 in 2020. The bare land decreased from 19.05 km2 in 1984 to 6.09 km2 in 2020. The average annual change area of the construction land, forest land, water bodies, mudflats, cropland/grassland, and bare land were 2.72 km2, -0.31 km2, 0.20 km2, -0.15 km2, -0.20 km2, and -0.36 km2, respectively. The average annual change rates of the construction land, forest land, water bodies, mudflats, cropland/grassland, and bare land were 5.28%, -0.16%, 2.33%, -0.93%, -0.10%, and -3.12%, respectively. The moving distance of gravity center of the construction land, forest land, water bodies, mudflats, cropland/grassland, and bare land were 2.98 km, 0.20 km, 2.38 km, 3.32 km, 0.98 km, and 8.39 km, respectively. The spatial distribution continuity and regional coordination of the construction land was significantly enhanced. The continuity of the spatial distribution of the forest land was continuously maintained at a high level. The spatial distribution of the water bodies was highly discrete. The continuity of the spatial distribution of the mudflats decreased. The spatial distribution and morphological features of the cropland/grassland tended to be discrete. The spatial continuity of the bare land increased. This research provides valuable dataset and gives insights for regional sustainable development planning and ecological assessment in Zhoushan Island, China.

TI  - Assessment of the benefit of a single sentinel-2 satellite image to small crop parcels mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study demonstrates the feasibility of producing crop type maps using a single high spatial resolution image from Sentinel-2A (S-2A). Our main objectives focus on the evaluation of the potential of S-2A data for crop mapping in the Tadla Plain and the determination of the most suitable period for discriminating different crops using a single S-2A image. In order to achieve these objectives, we have acquired a set of seven images of the S-2A and twelve vegetation indices. Then, we produced crop type maps at a spatial resolution of 10 m using (SVM) and (RF) classifiers for each image. The accuracy and performance of classification were assessed using field data. The optimal period for mapping was done during March with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 91.49%, 0.90 respectively. The results show that a single S-2A image should be sufficient for the discrimination of different crops.

TI  - Long-term column-averaged greenhouse gas observations using a COCCON spectrometer at the high-surface-albedo site in Gobabeb, Namibia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present column-averaged dryair mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2), CH4 (XCH4) and CO (XCO) from a recently established measurement site in Gobabeb, Namibia. Gobabeb is a hyperarid desert site at the sharp transition zone between the sand desert and the gravel plains, offering unique characteristics with respect to surface albedo properties. Measurements started in January 2015 and are performed utilizing a ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) EM27/SUN spectrometer of the COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON). Gobabeb is the first measurement site observing XCO2 and XCH4 on the African mainland and improves the global coverage of ground-based remote-sensing sites. In order to achieve the high level of precision and accuracy necessary for meaningful greenhouse gas observations, we performed calibration measurements for 8 d between November 2015 and March 2016 with the COCCON reference EM27/SUN spectrometer operated at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We derived scaling factors for XCO2, XCH4 and XCO with respect to the reference instrument that are close to 1.0. We compare the results obtained in Gobabeb to measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites at Reunion Island and Lauder. We choose these TCCON sites because, while 4000 km apart, the instruments at Gobabeb and Reunion Island operate at roughly the same latitude. The Lauder station is the southernmost TCCON station and functions as a background site without a pronounced XCO2 seasonal cycle. We find a good agreement for the absolute Xgas values, apart from an expected XCH4 offset between Gobabeb and Lauder due to significantly different tropopause height, as well as representative intraday variability between TCCON and COCCON. Together with the absence of longterm drifts, this highlights the quality of the COCCON measurements. In the southern hemispheric summer, we observe lower XCO2 values at Gobabeb compared to the TCCON stations, likely due to the influence of the African biosphere. We performed coincident measurements with the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), where GOSAT observed three nearby specific observation points, over the sand desert south of the station, directly over Gobabeb and over the gravel plains to the north. GOSAT H-gain XCO2 and XCH4 agree with the EM27/SUN measurements within the 1 sigma uncertainty limit. The number of coincident soundings is limited, but we confirm a bias of 1.2-2.6 ppm between GOSAT M-gain and H-gain XCO2 retrievals depending on the target point. This is in agreement with results reported by a previous study and the GOSAT validation team. We also report a bias of 5.9-9.8 ppb between GOSAT M-gain and H-gain XCH4 measurements which is within the range given by the GOSAT validation team. Finally, we use the COC-CON measurements to evaluate inversion-optimized CAMS model data. For XCO2, we find high biases of 0.9 +/- 0.5 ppm for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) assimilated product and 1.1 +/- 0.6 ppm for the in situ-driven product with R-2 > 0.9 in both cases. These biases are comparable to reported offsets between the model and TCCON data. The OCO-2 assimilated model product is able to reproduce the drawdown of XCO2 observed by the COCCON instrument at the beginning of 2017, as opposed to the in situ-optimized product.Also, for XCH4, the observed biases are in line with prior model comparisons with TCCON.

TI  - Earth observation data for seabirds and their habitats: An introduction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing, the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, has the potential to contribute greatly to conservation, ecology and biodiversity studies. Here, we introduce remote sensing capabilities that could contribute to seabird studies, covering remoting sensing of seabirds directly, and indirectly through remote sensing of seabird habitats. We focus on satellite remote sensing, as these data are the most readily available, and are mostly freely available, and we also present some additional Earth observation (EO) data. This is not an exhaustive list, rather a selection of practical and user-friendly data and tools that are publicly available. At present, the spatial resolution of optical commercial satellite imagery is high enough to identify the largest seabirds such as penguins and albatrosses. Military satellites are capable of higher resolutions that can detect 10 cm objects, but these are not available to the general public. Satellite observation and other EO datasets containing geographic and sea surface condition variables are useful for complementing seabird sightings and tracking data, with their associations justifiable for certain species, breeding status and locations. This paper is aimed at researchers in the fields of seabird conservation, ecology, and biodiversity whose research would benefit from satellite data and from knowing what data sources are available.

TI  - Signs of a new geomagnetic jerk between 2019 and 2020 from <i>Swarm</i> and observatory data
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the observed pattern of a new geomagnetic jerk every 3-4 years, certain predictions suggested that a new event should occur around 2020 after the one observed around 2017.5. In this work, we explore this scenario by analysing the secular variation of the East geomagnetic field component in both ground and satellite geomagnetic data. At ground, we use the available data from 2015 to 2021 in 10 observatories worldwide distributed. This analysis shows the occurrence of the mentioned jerk in mid-2017 at observatories located in the Pacific region, but also reveals a new jerk between mid-2019 and early 2020 with a clear global character. Swarm satellite data also corroborate these findings by means of the secular variation estimated using virtual observatories at 440 km altitude. In addition, a general view using the most recent CHAOS geomagnetic model confirms the global character of the 2020-jerk with V-shaped secular variation changes in meridional sectors covering the Eastern Pacific, America, Asia and the Indian Ocean; and Lambda-shapes in Europe, Africa and Western Pacific. The radial geomagnetic field at the core-mantle boundary is investigated as the origin of the new jerk. Results show that the global-average secular acceleration of the radial field exhibits a new pulse at mid-2018, establishing the starting epoch of the 2020-jerk.Highlights- Observatory and Swarm data reveal a new geomagnetic jerk around 2019-2020.- A very recent geomagnetic field model indicates the global character of the new jerk.- A new pulse at the CMB around mid-2018 seems to be the starting point of this jerk.

TI  - Enhanced Spatiotemporal Fusion via MODIS-Like Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) aims at generating remote-sensing data with both high spatial and temporal resolution. In the literature, one of the most widely used strategies to accomplish this goal is to fuse high temporal resolution images collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with images with finer spatial resolution than those provided by MODIS (e.g., those collected by other satellite instruments such as Landsat or Sentinel-2). Current STF methods generally fuse an upsampled MODIS image with finer spatial resolution images. This leads to two main problems. First of all, the model uncertainty errors (resulting from the ill-posed upsampling problem) will be propagated into the fusion results, leading to spatial and spectral distortion. Furthermore, the spatial details of the upsampled MODIS image may be significantly different from those of the finer spatial resolution images, making the STF problem even more challenging. In order to tackle these issues, in this work, we develop a new linear regression-based STF strategy (LiSTF), which performs the reconstruction from a MODIS-like image (instead of from an upsampled MODIS image), thus reducing the model uncertainty errors and preserving better the spatial information. The MODIS-like images are built from the finer spatial resolution images via downsampling. Our experimental results, conducted using two publicly available datasets of Landsat-MODIS image pairs and one publicly available dataset of Sentinel-MODIS image pairs, reveal that our newly proposed LiSTF approach can significantly enhance the quantitative and qualitative performance of STF, particularly in terms of preserving the spatial information.

TI  - Dendritic cell functions in the inductive and effector sites of intestinal immunity
T2  - MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The intestine is constantly exposed to foreign antigens, which are mostly innocuous but can sometimes be harmful. Therefore, the intestinal immune system has the delicate task of maintaining immune tolerance to harmless food antigens while inducing tailored immune responses to pathogens and regulating but tolerating the microbiota. Intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in these functions as sentinel cells able to prime and polarize the T cell responses. DCs are deployed throughout the intestinal mucosa but with local specializations along the gut length and between the diffuse effector sites of the gut lamina propria (LP) and the well-organized immune inductive sites comprising isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), Peyer's patches (PPs), and other species-specific gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs). Understanding the specificities of each intestinal DC subset, how environmental factors influence DC functions, and how these can be modulated is key to harnessing the therapeutic potential of mucosal adaptive immune responses, whether by enhancing the efficacy of mucosal vaccines or by increasing tolerogenic responses in inflammatory disorders. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to intestinal DCs in steady state and upon inflammation, with a special focus on their functional specializations, highly dependent on their microenvironment.

TI  - Continuous evaluation of the spatial representativeness of land surface temperature validation sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A reliable accuracy is essential for the application of land surface temperature (LST) products. Current satellite retrieved LSTs are mainly validated over a few homogeneous sites. However, most of the existing ground sites are located in inhomogeneous areas: thus, their spatial representativeness on satellite pixel scales is unknown. In this situation, how to evaluate the spatial representativeness of these inhomogeneous sites, quantify the influence introduced by the spatial representativeness and describe the variation of the site's spatial representativeness are critical questions for satellite LST validation. In an attempt to answer those questions, a so-called temporal variation method (TVM) is proposed for evaluating a ground site's spatial representativeness. The method defines a spatial representativeness indicator (SRI), which is the LST difference between a ground radiometer's field-ofview (FOV) and a satellite pixel, and describes a site's spatial representativeness. Based on the temporal variation of LST, the SRI time series consists of three temporal components: increment ATC, increment DTCF-P, and increment USC, which describe the annual, diurnal, and instantaneous variations of SRI, respectively. Associated with the Landsat TM/ETM+ data and weather parameters, the method is implemented and tested at 16 Chinese ground sites for the validation of MODIS and AATSR LST products. Results show that the temporally continuous SRI (SRITPR) shows high correlations with the original SRI (SRIORI). The variation of SRITPR is mainly determined by changes in surface coverage (i.e. NDVI difference on the two scales) and affected by weather conditions (e.g. near-surface air temperature, accumulative downward solar radiation, and wind speed). Since the SRI is defined as the LST difference between the two scales, it can be used as a bridge to convert the in-situ LST to pixel scale to address the spatial scale mismatch in LST validation. With this idea, the in-situ LST at daytime was converted to pixel scale associated with the SRITPR, and the corresponding MODIS and AATSR LST were validated at the 16 ground sites. Results for MODIS and AATSR LST show that the effect of spatial representativeness on the validation results over the sites is large, with mean biases between -1.95 K and 5.60 K and standard deviations between 0.07 K and 3.72 K. Since the TVM method does not rely on a specific satellite or land surface product, it is readily applied to other LST products (e.g. Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST, NOAA VIIRS LST) and surface parameters (e.g. surface longwave radiation).

TI  - Detecting the attack of the fall armyworm (<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>) in cotton plants with machine learning and spectral measurements
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Spodoptera frugiperda (i.e., fall armyworm) causes irreversible damage in cotton cultivars, and its visual inspection on plants is a burdensome task for humans. A recent strategy to automatically do similar tasks is processing hyperspectral reflectance measurements with machine learning algorithms. Herein, its proposed a framework for modeling the spectral response of cotton plants under the fall armyworm attacks using machine learning algorithms, culminating in a theoretical model creation based on the band simulation process. A controlled experiment was conducted to collect hyperspectral radiance measurements from health and damage cotton plants over eight days. A hand-held spectroradiometer operating from 350 to 2500 nm was used. Several algorithms were evaluated, and a ranking approach was adopted to identify the most contributive wavelengths for detecting the damage. The Self-Organizing Map method was applied to organize the spectral wavelengths into groups, favoring the theoretical model creation for two sensors: OLI (Landsat-8) and MSI (Sentinel-2). It was found that the Random Forest algorithm produced the most suitable model, and the last day of analysis was better to separate healthy and damaged plants (F-measure: 0.912). The best spectral regions range from the red to near-infrared (650 to 1350 nm) and the shortwave infrared (1570 to 1640 nm). The theoretical model returned accurate results using both sensors (OLI, F-Measure = 0.865, and MSI, F-Measure = 0.886). In conclusion, the proposed framework contributes to accurately identifying cotton plants under the Spodoptera frugiperda attack for both hyperspectral and multispectral scales.

TI  - Estimating aboveground net primary productivity of reforested trees in an urban landscape using biophysical variables and remotely sensed data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, urban reforestation programs have emerged as potential carbon sinks and climate mitigates in urban landscapes. Thus, spatially explicit information on net primary productivity (NPP) of reforested trees in urban environments is central to understanding the value of reforestation initiatives in the global carbon budget and climate regulation potential. To date, numerous studies have mainly focused on natural and commercial forests NPP at a regional scale based on coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed data. Generally, local scale NPP studies based on fine spatial resolution data are limited. Therefore, this study sought to estimate aboveground NPP of an urban reforested landscape using biophysical and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager data derived variables. Using the MOD17 model, results showed that mean NPP ranged between 6.24 Mg C ha(-1) with high coefficient of determination (R-2 : 0.92) and low RMSE (0.82 Mg ha(-1)) across all reforested trees within the study area. Results also showed a considerable variation in NPP among the reforested trees, with deciduous Acacia and Dalbergia obovate species showing the highest NPP (7.62 Mg C ha(-1) and 7.58 Mg C ha(-1)) respectively), while the evergreen Syzygium cordatum and shrub Artemisia afro had the lowest NPP (4.54 Mg C ha(-1) and 526 Mg C ha(-1)). Furthermore, the multiple linear regression analysis showed that vegetation specific biophysical variables (i.e. leaf area index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation) significantly improved the estimation of reforested aboveground NPP at a fine-scale resolution. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of biophysical and remotely sensed variables in determining NPP (as carbon sequestration surrogate) at fine-scaled reforested urban landscape. Furthermore, the utility of species biometric measurements and MOD17 model offers unprecedented opportunity for improved local scale reforestation assessment and monitoring schedules.

TI  - Analysis of urban expansion and land use/land cover changes using geospatial techniques: a case of Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion on agricultural land is driven by rapid population growth and is seen as a critical problem in Sub-Saharan African countries. This study was attempted to analyze the dynamics of urban expansion and land use land cover (LULC) changes using geospatial techniques in Addis Ababa City. In the present study, rate and extent of built-up area as well as changes of LULC types were derived from multispectral band of Landsat 5 TM (1990), Landsat 7 ETM + (2003), and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2020), respectively. The expansion of built-up area in the periphery of the city was generated by using supervised classification method with maximum likelihood algorithm from 1990 to2020. The result of the study shows that built-up area was the most dominated LULC types in the study area from 1990 to 2020. Consequently, built-up area was increased by the rate of 2.77km(2)/year in the past three decades whereas agriculture and grassland were decreased by the 2.68 km(2)/year and 1.78 km(2)/year, respectively, over the study period. The results show that the built-up area was increased by an area 83.2km(2) while agriculture and grassland were decreased by 80.4km(2) and 53.4km(2) from 1990 to 2020, respectively. Agriculture and grassland were converted to built-up area by an area of 41.1km(2) and 17.3km(2), from 1990 to 2020, respectively. This is mainly because of rapid expansion of built-up area and declined of agricultural land and grassland in the periphery of the city. To minimize the rapid expansions of built-up area on agricultural and grassland, the city planners should look other land use types like bare land. Moreover, urban agriculture should be promoted in the periphery of the city. This study can help to improve land use policy and enhance public understanding on the dynamics of LULC change and its implications on sustainable land management around big cities. The use of Geographic Information System (GIS) in urban planning and land use management is essential not optional to minimize the anticipated impacts of urban expansions on agricultural and other LULC classes.

TI  - Isolation of <i>Culicoides-</i> and Mosquito-Borne Orbiviruses in the Southwestern Islands of Japan Between 2014 and 2019
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The circulation of arboviruses in livestock ruminants has often gone unrecognized owing to the fact that a significant percentage of arboviruses probably induce subclinical infections and/or negligible symptoms in infected animals. To determine the current situation of arbovirus circulation in the Yaeyama Islands, attempts to isolate viruses from bovine blood samples collected between 2014 and 2019 have been made. In total, 308 blood samples were collected during the study period, and 43 of them induced cytopathic effects (CPEs) in cell cultures. The identification of the CPE agents was performed by reported RT-PCR assays and a high-throughput analysis with a next-generation sequencing platform. The obtained viruses consisted of an orthobunyavirus (Peaton virus), Culicoides-borne orbiviruses (bluetongue virus serotypes 12 and 16, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus [EHDV] serotypes 5, 6, and 7, D'Aguilar virus, and Bunyip Creek virus), and potential mosquito-borne orbiviruses (Yunnan orbivirus, Guangxi orbivirus, and Yonaguni orbivirus). Most of the orbiviruses were recovered from washed blood cells with mosquito cell cultures, suggesting that this combination was more efficient than other combinations such as plasma/blood cells and hamster cell lines. This marked the first time that the isolation of EHDV serotypes 5 and 6 and three potential mosquito-borne orbiviruses was recorded in Japan, showing a greater variety of orbiviruses on the islands than previously known. Genetic analysis of the isolated orbiviruses suggested that the Yaeyama Islands and its neighboring regions were epidemiologically related. Some of the viruses, especially the potential mosquito-borne orbiviruses, were isolated during several consecutive years, indicating their establishment on the islands.

T2  - CANCER CONTROL
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with conjuctival melanoma (CjM). Study design Retrospective observational cohort study and literature review. Subjects Slovenian patients with CjM are included in the study. Methods Prospectively collected data of CjM patients treated from June 2005 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Main outcome measures The numbers of SLN biopsy procedures, positive and false positive SLN, and local and regional relapses have been described together with overall survival. Results From June 2005 until December 2016, 24 patients with CjM were treated. The median follow-up time was 65.3 months. The mean Breslow thickness was 1.5 mm (sd = 1.8 mm), and ulceration was present in 29% of cases. Altogether, 14/24 (58%) SLN biopsy procedures were performed. SLN was positive in 2/14 (14%) cases. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) of the group was 72.5%, with a median survival of 151 months (95% CI 77-224). From January 2013 to January 2020, five (5/140, 3%) authors reported results comparable to our study. Conclusion Our results confirm that CjM is a rare disease with approximately 14% of positive SLN. At the moment, there are no firm conclusions regarding who would benefit most from SLN biopsy or whether or not CLND should be offered. Data from literature emphasize the need for consistent and uniform staging and future multicentric studies.

M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of lakes and reservoirs leads to the high need for monitoring lake water quality both at local and global scales. Remote sensing is a rapidly evolving, versatile technology that can be successfully applied in several economic and scientific fields. Numerous studies demonstrate the applicability of satellites in algae detection and monitoring. Algae play an essential role in aquatic ecosystems, although their overgrowth poses a serious risk. Overgrowth of algae, also known as algal bloom, has serious ecological, social, economic and health effects. The research area of our study was Lake Balaton, the largest lake in Central Europe. The aim was to find the most appropriate algorithm(s) for the inland lake to define the chlorophyll-a amount. In addition, two new algorithms were developed based on the reflectance values of the satellite image. The results show that the two highest correlations were performed by the newly validated, blue/green ratio-based algorithm, Chl-a(B/G) (r = 0.93) and the chl_re_oc2 algorithm (r = 0.86) of the Acolite software. Although the Acolite software was not developed for lakes but for marine waters, it is also applicable to inland waters.

TI  - Resident human dermal γ6T-cells operate as stress-sentinels: Lessons from the hair follicle
T2  - JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Murine gamma 6T-cells have stress-surveillance functions and are implicated in autoimmunity. Yet, whether human gamma 6T-cells are also stress sentinels and directly promote autoimmune responses in the skin is unknown. Using a novel (mini-)organ assay, we tested if human dermis resident gamma 6T-cells can recognize stressed human scalp hair follicles (HFs) to promote an alopecia areata (AA)-like autoimmune response. Accordingly, we show that gamma 6Tcells from healthy human scalp skin are activated (CD69+), up-regulate the expression of NKG2D and IFN-gamma, and become cytotoxic when co-cultured with autologous stressed HFs ex vivo. These autologous gamma 6T-cells induce HF immune privilege collapse, dystrophy, and premature catagen, i.e. three hallmarks of the human autoimmune HF disorder, AA. This is mediated by CXCL12, MICA, and in part by IFN-gamma and CD1d. In conclusion, human dermal gamma 6T-cells exert physiological stress-sentinel functions in human skin, where their excessive activity can promote autoimmunity towards stressed HFs that overexpress CD1d, CXCL12, and/or MICA.

TI  - Coupling and coordination of coal mining intensity and social-ecological resilience in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal is an important global energy resource. However, the negative impacts of mining are important factors restricting the sustainable development of mining areas. Under the superimposed influences of different mining intensities, different natural ground conditions, and social-economic development, there are large differences in the restoration characteristics and response strategies for mining. To guide the development and utilization of coal resources and ecological restoration, the spatial distribution should be appropriately analyzed at the macroscale. Based on the web-crawler technology and multi-source remote sensing data, this paper attempted to estimate the mining intensity and the social-ecological resilience respectively at the county level, to divide the mining areas into nine regions in China. Based on the zoning results, differentiated strategies were proposed for ecological restoration and resource development and utilization in the various coal mining regions. The valuation results suggested that coal mines are widely distributed and abundant in China, mainly concentrated in the central, southwest and northwest regions. However, nearly half of the coal mining regions are with low resilience. Especially, high mining intensity-low resilience areas are concentrated in north China which account for 10.83%. These areas should receive special attention to prevent possible ecological risks and minimize economic effects. Social-ecological resilience measures system adaptation to coal mining disturbances, which can be regarded as the standard of mining intensity adjustment. In the future, local governments can try to combine ecological restoration and resource development strategies to provide support for the sustainable development of coal mining areas in China.

T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term poverty data can support accurate decision-making. This study demonstrates an accurate and reliable method for identifying poverty areas and predicting poverty incidence based on night time light remote-sensing data and machine learning methods. Using data of poverty counties and poverty incidence in Guizhou Province of China as the training dataset, we show how to use machine learning to identify poverty counties and predict poverty incidence in the Yunnan-Guangxi-Guizhou Rocky desertification area. The identification accuracy of poverty-stricken counties was 76.5%. The root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R2 values of the poverty incidence rates were 5.01, 4.04, and 0.60, respectively. Using data from 2015 to verify the trained model, the R2 value of the predicted and actual values of poverty incidence reached 0.95. With the progress in machine learning and night light remote sensing, poverty mapping combined with night time lights and machine learning can compensate for the data gap in deprived areas and provide a decision-making basis for sustainable development in poverty-stricken areas.

TI  - Temperature, Moisture, Hyperspectral Vegetation Indexes, and Leaf Traits Regulated Soil Respiration in Different Crop Planting Fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate how the regulatory factors (i.e., temperature, moisture, vegetation indexes, and leaf traits) of soil respiration differed in the different croplands. A field study including 2019 soybean, maize, and sweet potato and 2020 peanut, pea, and sesame growing seasons was performed. The soil respiration, soil temperature, moisture, hyperspectral vegetation indexes, leaf area index (LAI), and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were measured. The seasonal cumulative soil respiration was 0.523 +/- 0.040, 0.383 +/- 0.029, 0.358 +/- 0.018, 0.561 +/- 0.010, 0.570 +/- 0.017, and 0.586 +/- 0.028 kg C m(-2) in the soybean, maize, sweet potato, peanut, pea, and sesame croplands, respectively. Soil respiration was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the maize and sweet potato croplands than in the soybean cropland in 2019, but the effects between croplands were not significant (P > 0.05) in 2020. The main regulatory factors of soil respiration were temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), and SPAD value in the soybean and maize croplands, while they were temperature, NDVI, photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and LAI in the sweet potato, peanut, pea, and sesame croplands. A model based on soil temperature, hyperspectral vegetation indexes, and LAI (or SPAD value) explained 77.2-89.1% of the variation in soil respiration in the soybean, maize, peanut, pea, and sesame croplands. This study demonstrated the potential applicability of vegetation indexes, LAI, and SPAD value in estimating soil respiration in different croplands at a large scale.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is highly sensitive to global climate change and strongly influences the climate at global and regional scales. Because of limited in situ observations, snow cover dynamics in the Nyang River basin (NRB) have been examined in few studies. Five snow cover indices derived from observation and remote sensing data from 2000 to 2018 were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of snow cover in the NRB. There was clear seasonality in the snow cover throughout the entire basin. The maximum snow-covered area was 8,751.35 km(2), about 50% of the total basin area, and occurred in March. The maximum snow depth (SD) was 5.35 cm and was found at the northern edge of the middle reaches of the basin. Snow cover frequency, SD, and fraction of snow cover area increased with elevation. The decrease in SD was the most marked in the elevation range of 5,000-6,000 m. Above 6,000 m, the snow water equivalent showed a slight upward trend. There was a significant negative correlation between snow cover and temperature. The results of this study could improve our understanding of changes in snow cover in the NRB from multivariate perspectives. It is better for water resources management. HIGHLIGHTSDifferent snow cover indices were used to evaluate the snow cover characteristics of Nyang River basin. Snow cover days data were collected for calculating snow cover frequency to evaluate the character of the basin. The temporal and spatial distribution of snow cover in Nyang River basin was clarified. There is a significant negative correlation between snow cover and air temperature.

TI  - An all-sky 1 km daily land surface air temperature product over mainland China for 2003-2019 from MODIS and ancillary data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Surface air temperature (T-a), as an important climate variable, has been used in a wide range of fields such as ecology, hydrology, climatology, epidemiology, and environmental science. However, ground measurements are limited by poor spatial representation and inconsistency, and reanalysis and meteorological forcing datasets suffer from coarse spatial resolution and inaccuracy. Previous studies using satellite data have mainly estimated T-a under clear-sky conditions or with limited temporal and spatial coverage. In this study, an all-sky daily mean land T-a product at a 1 km spatial resolution over mainland China for 2003-2019 has been generated mainly from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset. Three T-a estimation models based on random forest were trained using ground measurements from 2384 stations for three different clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions. The random sample validation results showed that the R-2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of the three models ranged from 0.984 to 0.986 and from 1.342 to 1.440 K, respectively. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns and land cover type dependences of model accuracy. Two cross-validation (CV) strategies of leave-time-out (LTO) CV and leave-location-out (LLO) CV were also used to evaluate the models. Finally, we developed the all-sky T-a dataset from 2003 to 2009 and compared it with the China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) dataset at a 0.0625 degrees spatial resolution, the China Meteorological Forcing Data (CMFD) dataset at a 0.1 degrees spatial resolution, and the GLDAS dataset at a 0.25 degrees spatial resolution. Validation accuracy of our product in 2010 was significantly better than other datasets, with R-2 and RMSE values of 0.992 and 1.010 K, respectively. In summary, the developed all-sky daily mean land T-a dataset has achieved satisfactory accuracy and high spatial resolution simultaneously, which fills the current dataset gap in this field and plays an important role in the studies of climate change and the hydrological cycle. This dataset is currently freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4399453 (Chen et al., 2021b) and the University of Maryland (http://glass.umd.edu/Ta_China/, last access: 24 August 2021). A sub-dataset that covers Beijing generated from this dataset is also publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4405123 (Chen et al., 2021a).

TI  - UFS-LSTM: unsupervised feature selection with long short-term memory network for remote sensing scene classification
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to perform remote sensing scene classification, because it supports numerous strategic research fields like land use and land cover monitoring. However, classifying an enormous amount of remote sensing data is a challenging task in scene classification. In this research work, a new model is introduced to improve the feature extraction ability for better scene classification. A multiscale Retinex technique is employed for color restoration, and contrast enhancement in the aerial images that are collected from UC Merced, aerial image dataset, and RESISC45. Further, the feature extraction is carried out using steerable pyramid transform, gray level co-occurrence matrix features, and local ternary pattern. The feature extraction mechanism reduces overfitting risks, improves training process, and data visualization ability. Generally, the extracted features are high dimension, so an unsupervised feature selection based on multi subspace randomization and collaboration with state transition algorithm is proposed for selecting active features for better multiclass classification. The selected features are fed to long short term memory network for scene type classification. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved 99.14 %, 98.09%, and 99.25% of overall classification accuracy on UC Merced, RESISC45 and aerial image dataset. The proposed model showed a minimum of 0.03 % and maximum of 18.6 % improvement in classification accuracy compared to the existing models like self-attention based deep feature fusion, multitask learning system with convolutional neural network, multilayer feature fusion Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, and transfer learning model on UC Merced, RESISC45 and aerial dataset, respectively.

TI  - Polycentric urban growth and identification of urban hot spots in Faridabad, the million-plus metropolitan city of Haryana, India: a zonal assessment using spatial metrics and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycentric urban structure is the recent trend of new-age sustainable cities in India. Limited research is reported focused on quantitative analysis of polycentric structure at the intracity level. In the present research, a detailed database has been generated using multitemporal satellite imageries. Zone-wise quantitative analysis, supported by the database, exhibits clear evidence of transit-oriented polycentric urban growth around Old Faridabad, NIT and Ballabhgarh. Linear urban expansion close to highways, railways, metro ways and urban extension as Greater Faridabad has led to the vertical expansion of the city. Highly variable urban density has been observed in the southern and south-western zones. Shannon's entropy has identified even distribution of built-up around Old Faridabad, whereas clustering of high urban density around NIT and Ballabhgarh. Getis-Ord Gi* statistics have identified a consistent increase of urban hot spot areas from 21.92% (2007), 26% (2012) to 27.48% (2017). The present study suggests planners and policymakers to improve the connectivity between the upcoming urban centre Greater Faridabad, three existing urban centres and other under-developed districts of Haryana to achieve balanced development. Such a step would contribute to the sustainable solutions for various issues over the hot spot around the current urban centres and achieve inclusive urban growth in Faridabad. Moreover, current findings contribute to building a model framework for analysing urban growth patterns even for other satellite cities of India.

TI  - Combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 to investigate seasonal changes of suspended particulate matter off the abandoned distributary mouths of Yellow River Delta
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is the primary component of coastal waters. The spatiotemporal dynamics of SPM has an important influence on water bio-optical properties, pollutant diffusion, landform evolution, and carbon, oxygen, and nutrient cycles. This study presents the spatial distribution of monthly average SPM concentrations from 2017 to 2020 in the abandoned Diaokouhe and Shenxiangou distributary mouths of the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The SPM concentrations were derived based on 161 Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A/B MSI satellite images. Accuracy assessment using the synchronous in-situ measurements (R-2 = 0.91, root mean square error (RMSE) = 38.79 mg/L, and relative percentage difference (RPD) = 23.45%) and cross comparison between SPM concentrations derived from the two sensors (R-2 = 0.97, RPD = 8.77%) showed convincing performances. Our results show that the monthly average SPM is characterized by significant seasonality, with a higher concentration and wider range in dry seasons compared to that in wet seasons. The spatial distributions of SPM are closely associated with coastal water depths. The SPM concentration in the Shenxiangou mouth is always lower than that of the shallower Diaokouhe mouth. The long-term seabed erosion provides a continuous supply of sediment. Wind-wave forces explain the seasonal variations of SPM by inducing the resuspension of bottom sediments. The residual currents control the transportation of SPM to the offshore and to the east. The artificial groins located between the two river mouths show obvious sediment trapping effects. Moreover, the interception capability of impermeable groins is considerably better than that of permeable groins.

TI  - Does leakage exist in China's typical protected areas? Evidence from 13 national nature reserves
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is profound interest in knowing the degree to which the effectiveness of China's nature reserves, and whether leakage is common around the reserves, in the face of the most drastic conflicts between conservation and development in the world. To answer these questions, we employed the Landsat-derived Global Forest Change Dataset with 30-m resolution to examine forest change patterns during 2001 and 2017 both inside and outside of 13 typically national nature reserves in China. The average forest loss rates inside the reserves were significantly lower than those of outside the reserves (i.e., both in buffer and landscape zones), suggesting the success in protecting forest of these reserves in China. We found that the protection practice reduced approximately 10% of deforestation. Protection efficiency may be substantially overestimated (about 13-43%) if failing to control the related variables, such as altitude, climate, and human interference. The forest loss rates in the buffer zones were not significantly higher than those in the broader landscape zones, suggesting that leakage is not a frequent occurrence in the buffer zones of the reserves. However, the forest loss rates showed a slightly increasing tendency from 2001 to 2017, the loss rates increased gradually from inside to their outside buffer zones, and leakage was observed in certain zones of some years for most of the reserves. The conversions of forest to grassland and cultivated land were the primary trajectories of forest loss both inside and outside of the reserves. Though the leakage is not universal in the reserves across the country, forest loss rates are much higher in the buffer zones than those inside the reserves, resulting in increased insulation of the reserves that could undermine the provisioning of ecosystem services and the biodiversity conservation efficiency.

TI  - Spatially and Temporally Resolved Monitoring of Glacial Lake Changes in Alps During the Recent Two Decades
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming is intensifying the melting of glaciers and the growth of glacial lakes in the Alps, which has a profound impact on the management of water resources and high-mountain hydropower in this region. However, the research on the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the Alps glacial lakes of various types still lacks a holistic view. In this study, we developed an inventory of Alps glacial lakes of different types and then obtained the annual areas of these lakes from 2000 to 2019 using JRC Global Surface Water and Global Land Analysis and Discovery data at a resolution of 30 m. A total of 498 glacial lakes (>0.01 km(2)) with the net area of 33.77 +/- 6.94 km(2) were identified in the Alps in 2019 and are mainly distributed in the western and central Alps. These Alps glacial lakes, with the area ranging 0.01-1.59 km(2), are generally dominated by small-sized ones. The comparison of lakes of different types indicated that ice-uncontacted lakes are dominant in number and area, accounting for 59.4 and 58.4%, respectively. In terms of the elevation distribution, almost half of the lakes are concentrated at the altitude of 2,250-2,750 m (a.s.l.). Meanwhile, the mean altitude of small glacial lakes is higher than that of large lakes. The distribution of ice-contacted lakes and supraglacial lakes were more concentrated, and the mean altitude was higher. During the study period, the number, area, and water volume of glacial lakes were increasing, but the expansion varied between different periods. The changing trends of the glacial lake area and volume were consistent and presents in three stages, as the glacial lake expanded rapidly in the first 5 years and in the last 7 years and remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2012. The number and area of glacier-fed lakes increased rapidly, while the non-glacier-fed lakes were relatively stable. The area change rate of supraglacial lakes was the largest (+47%). This study provides a spatially-complete and temporally-consecutive picture of glacial lake changes in the Alps and can be greatly helpful for future research on climate-glacier-lake interactions, glacial lake outburst floods, and freshwater resources in this region.</p>

TI  - Rapid eco-physical impact assessment of tropical cyclones using geospatial technology: a case from severe cyclonic storms Amphan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical cyclones are very destructive during landfall, generating high wind speeds, heavy intensive rainfall, and severe storm surges with huge coastal inundations that have massive socioeconomic and ecological catastrophic effects on human beings and the economic well-being. The sizable ecological effects of cyclonic storms cannot be ignored because of the uncertainty of impact, intensity induced by a warming ocean, and sea level rise. The Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which falls under the category five classifications under the scheme of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), on the basis the maximum sustained wind speeds gusting up to 168 km/h affected parts of West Bengal and Odisha in India, and south-west Bangladesh between May 16 and 20, 2020. In this work, we have focused on the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore in Odisha, Purba Medinipur, and South Twenty-Four Parganas in West Bengal, India and, Khulna, Barisal division of Bangladesh that have been seriously affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan. The objective of the study is to analyze the eco-physical assessment of tropical cyclone Amphan using geospatial technology. Therefore, shoreline change detection and enhance vegetation index have been used in this research work to systematically analyze the eco-physical impact parameters of Cyclonic Storm Amphan using ortho-rectified Landsat 8/OLI imagery and MODIS dataset of USGS with high spatial resolutions of 30-500 m. The result highlights that about 60.33% of the total transects of the study area was eroded, but only 24.99% of the total transects experienced accretion, and 14.68% of the total transects depicted stability. The scientific study will benefit coastal managers and policymakers in formulating action plans for coastal zone management, natural resilience, and sustainable future development.

TI  - Enhanced Susceptibility of Methylmercury Bioaccumulation into Seston of the Laurentian Great Lakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury concentrations in the Laurentian Great Lakes waters are among the lowest reported in the literature, while game fish concentrations approach consumption advisory limits, particularly in Lakes Superior, Huron, and Michigan, indicating efficient methylmercury transfer from water to game fish. To determine if increased transfer efficiency is evident within the lower food web, we measured (2010-2018) mercury and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in water, and in size-sieved seston, dietary tracers (carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios), phytoplankton methylmercury bioaccumulation, and methyl-mercury biomagnification between increasing seston size fractions. We observed consistently low filter-passing methylmercury (<0.010 ng L-1) and comparatively variable DOC (1.1 to 3.4 mg L-1) concentrations. Methylmercury biomagnification factors between size-sieved seston were similar between lakes. Bioaccumulation factors in phytoplankton were among the highest in the literature (log 5.5 to 6.1), exceeding those in oceans, smaller lakes, and streams, and was influenced by DOC. Higher bioaccumulation rates increase the susceptibility of methylmercury accumulation into the food web. Because mercury is dominantly delivered to the Great Lakes through the atmosphere and the biota therein is highly susceptible to methylmercury uptake, we propose that the Laurentian Great Lakes are excellent sentinels to trace the success of efforts to decrease global mercury emissions (e.g., Minamata Treaty) in the future.

TI  - MODIS high-resolution MAIAC aerosol product: Global validation and analysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempt to verify the accuracy of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product on a global scale using AOD measurements during 2000-2019 at 332 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites. The results indicate that MAIAC AOD retrievals are highly correlated with ground-based AOD measurements. The correlation coefficients (R) are greater than 0.8 at more than 68% of AERONET sites. Meanwhile, the performance of MAIAC AOD retrievals in different climate zones is also investigated. The accuracy of MAIAC AOD retrievals is high (within expected error (EE) = 87.49% and 83.15%) in the regions of tropical rainforest climate and tropical open forest climate. Then, the uncertainties and estimation deviation of MAIAC AOD retrievals in various land-cover-types are analyzed. The results find that the MAIAC AOD retrievals show high correlation with aerosol measurements in the forest (within EE > 95%), while the poor accuracy is always observed in the barren areas (within EE = 62.56%, RMSE = 0.12). The uncertainty of the MAIAC AOD retrievals is not only related to the satellite and solar geometries, but also depends on the aerosol conditions, which become larger with the increase of aerosol loading and Angstrom exponent (AE). Finally, the spatial variations of AOD values over the world are investigated. High AOD values are mainly distributed in Central Africa, Saudi Arabia, Southern Asia and China.

TI  - Reversal of SARS-CoV2-Induced Hypoxia by Nebulized Sodium Ibuprofenate in a Compassionate Use Program
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sodium ibuprofenate in hypertonic saline (NaIHS) administered directly to the lungs by nebulization and inhalation has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, with the potential to deliver these benefits to hypoxic patients. We describe a compassionate use program that offered this therapy to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods NaIHS (50 mg ibuprofen, tid) was provided in addition to standard of care (SOC) to hospitalized COVID-19 patients until oxygen saturation levels of > 94% were achieved on ambient air. Patients wore a containment hood to diminish aerosolization. Outcome data from participating patients treated at multiple hospitals in Argentina between April 4 and October 31, 2020, are summarized. Results were compared with a retrospective contemporaneous control (CC) group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SOC alone during the same time frame from a subset of participating hospitals from Cordoba and Buenos Aires. Results The evolution of 383 patients treated with SOC + NaIHS [56 on mechanical ventilation (MV) at baseline] and 195 CC (21 on MV at baseline) are summarized. At baseline, NaIHS-treated patients had basal oxygen saturation of 90.7 +/- 0.2% (74.3% were on supplemental oxygen at baseline) and a basal respiratory rate of 22.7 +/- 0.3 breath/min. In the CC group, basal oxygen saturation was 92.6 +/- 0.4% (52.1% were on oxygen supplementation at baseline) and respiratory rate was 19.3 +/- 0.3 breath/min. Despite greater pulmonary compromise at baseline in the NaIHS-treated group, the length of treatment (LOT) was 9.1 +/- 0.2 gs with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 11.5 +/- 0.3 days, in comparison with an ALOS of 13.3 +/- 0.9 days in the CC group. In patients on MV who received NaIHS, the ALOS was lower than in the CC group. In both NaIHS-treated groups, a rapid reversal of deterioration in oxygenation and NEWS2 scores was observed acutely after initiation of NaIHS therapy. No serious adverse events were considered related to ibuprofen therapy. Mortality was lower in both NaIHS groups compared with CC groups. Conclusions Treatment of COVID-19 pneumonitis with inhalational nebulized NaIHS was associated with rapid improvement in hypoxia and vital signs, with no serious adverse events attributed to therapy. Nebulized NaIHS s worthy of further study in randomized, placebo-controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04382768).

TI  - Refining medium resolution fractional cover for arid Australia to detect vegetation dynamics and wind erosion susceptibility on longitudinal dunes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium resolution satellite-derived fractional cover estimates of bare soil (f(BS)), photosynthetic vegetation (f(PV)), and non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) provide a powerful means to study arid ecosystem dynamics. This paper employed remote sensing estimates of f(PV) and f(NPV) from five case study sites from Australia's vegetated dunefields to observe (a) vegetation growth response to rainfall 'pulses' and subsequent transition to nonphotosynthetic dormancy or senescence; (b) multiple time scales of antecedent climatic influence on vegetation cover; (c) the susceptibility of dunes to wind-blown sand drift during periods of low cover; and (d) the implications of image resolution choice when ground cover is heterogeneous.A spectral unmixing model for Australia's arid zone (termed 'AZN') was first developed by generating endmembers from a dataset of 1405 field surveys; Landsat time series estimates of f(PV) and f(NPV) were subject to a Seasonal-Trend decomposition by Loess (STL); Time series components were correlated with rainfall (P) and aridity at various accumulation periods; Fire maps were used to compare the climatic response of unburnt and burnt vegetation; Landform maps were used to isolate dune vegetation cover from the adjacent interdunes; and Landsat estimates of erodible area were compared with Sentinel-2 and WorlView-3 data.The new AZN model yielded Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) estimates of 14.5% (f(BS)), 6.5% (f(PV)) and 15.8% (f(NPV)) during cross validation. The AZN model also compared favourably to an existing continental-scale model when evaluated with independent reference data. Rainfall pulse responses of dune vegetation were detected initially as f(PV), and 3-9 months later as a peak in f(NPV). Components of f(PV) responded to P accumulated over 3-9-months (intra-annual), and 12-15-months (trend). The long-term build-up of f(NPV), if left unburnt, was influenced by rainfall patterns over the preceding 45-114 months. Fires reduced both the depth and strength of antecedent rainfall's influence on vegetation, and vegetation was often more sensitive to P than to aridity. Erodibility (total cover <14%) and partial erodibility (cover <35%) were more common at the driest sites but did not universally match aridity levels, due to fires and differing vegetation. The targeting of dune crest regions highlighted their enhanced susceptibility to sand drift (in most cases), and, given their occurrence on relatively narrow ridges (similar to 30 m), the importance of estimating cover at Landsat resolutions or better (e.g. Sentinel-2).

TI  - Predicting energy poverty with combinations of remote-sensing and socioeconomic survey data in India: Evidence from machine learning
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying energy poverty and targeting interventions require up-to-date and comprehensive survey data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to conduct, especially in rural areas of developing countries. This paper examined the potential of satellite remote sensing data in energy poverty prediction combined with so-cioeconomic survey data in response to these challenges. We found that a machine learning algorithm incor-porating geographical and environmental remotely collected indicators could identify 90.91% of the districts with high energy poverty and performs better than those using socioeconomic indicators only. Specifically, precipitation and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) offer the most significant contribution. Moreover, the algorithm, which was trained using a dataset from 2015, could also perform well to predict energy poverty using two environment indicators: precipitation and PM2.5 concentration.

TI  - Deep learning for processing and analysis of remote sensing big data: a technical review
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of Earth observation technology has produced an increasing growth in remote sensing big data, posing serious challenges for effective and efficient processing and analysis. Meanwhile, there has been a massive rise in deep-learning-based algorithms for remote sensing tasks, providing a large opportunity for remote sensing big data. In this article, we initially summarize the features of remote sensing big data. Subsequently, following the pipeline of remote sensing tasks, a detailed and technical review is conducted to discuss how deep learning has been applied to the processing and analysis of remote sensing data, including geometric and radiometric processing, cloud masking, data fusion, object detection and extraction, land-use/cover classification, change detection and multitemporal analysis. Finally, we discussed technical challenges and concluded directions for future research in deep-learning-based applications for remote sensing big data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics evaluation of pixel-level gross domestic product, electric power consumption, and carbon emissions in countries along the belt and road
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ambiguous relationship between the international economy, energy, and carbon emissions has become a significant factor restricting sustainable development. This study attempts to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics and interrelationships of gross domestic product (GDP), electric power consumption (EPC), and carbon emissions (CE) in the Belt and Road (B&R) regions using Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) remote sensing data. Annual nighttime light (ANL) images were synthesized, and the accuracy of the ANL data was improved using the multiperiod mask denoising method. Then, the GDP, EPC, and CE at 0.5 km resolution were modelled. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of regional development were comprehensively analysed at multiple scales. The results reveal that the development in the eastern and western parts of the B&R regions has significant differences. China, India, and some countries in Southeast Asia have developed rapidly and in a relatively balanced manner, whereas the development of Central and Eastern Europe and western Russia has been relatively slow and uncoordinated. The geographical centre of the overall development of the B&R continued to migrate to the southeast. This study provides more detailed and comprehensive insights into GDP, EPC, and CE in the B&R regions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spectral signature analysis to determine mangrove species delineation structured by anthropogenic effects
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used the spectral information divergence (SID) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm classification to identify - 40,000 individual trees from 19 mangrove species; these data were collected from 7 sampling points spread across 40,288 ha of the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in the state of Perak, Malaysia. This information was examined and analysed to answer two questions: (1) can medium resolution of satellite image identify the individual mangrove species (2) how are the distributions of individual species within the mangrove zonation associated with the anthropogenic matrix? Species identification with spectral library derived from the in-situ measurements using the SID algorithm was compared with that derived from the Landsat 8 using the SAM algorithm; it was found that the two methods offered different but complementary information with different rates of accuracy. The observed levels of classification accuracy are at 84.95% and 85.21%, respectively for SID and SAM algorithm classification. The mangrove species distribution has a correlation with the anthropogenic activities, but the distribution occurred randomly without specific zones. All the 19 selected mangrove species are closely related with different correlation by the anthropogenic activities. The use of the SID and SAM algorithms may provide the most promising way of classification for improving the mangrove species identification, with medium resolution of satellite image. Recognising the characteristics of mangrove zonation may give a better understanding of mangrove species appearances and conservation. However, mangrove zonation will remain a daunting mapping task and is a challenge for the ecologists in the future.

TI  - Should Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Status Guide Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in Patients With Merkel Cell Carcinoma?
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Radiation of the draining lymph node basin remains controversial for Merkel cell carcinoma, particularly in the era of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods and Materials: Based on a 20-year experience using SLNB-guided adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), we conducted a retrospective review of clinically node-negative patients testing 2 hypotheses: (1) whether nodal RT could be safely omitted in SLNB-negative Merkel cell carcinoma and (2) whether the excised primary site should always be radiated. Clinically node-positive patients were excluded.Results: Among 57 clinically node-negative patients who underwent SLNB and wide local excision (WLE), 42 (74%) had a negative SLNB, and 15 (26%) had a positive SLNB. At a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 5-182), SLNB-negative patients irradiated to the primary site had improved 4-year disease-specific survival (100% vs 65%, P = .008), local recurrence-free survival (100% vs 76%, P = .009), and distant recurrence-free survival (100% vs 75%, P = .008), but not overall survival (87.5% vs 57.7%, P = .164) compared with SLNB-positive patients receiving comprehensive RT. Among SLNB-negative patients treated with WLE only, 67% (6/9) had a disease relapse, half of which were local relapses (33%).Conclusions: In this single-institution retrospective review, after negative SLNB and WLE, RT given only to the primary site provided 100% disease control without a need for nodal RT. Among SLNB-negative patients who had WLE, omission of postoperative primary-site RT was associated with 67% cancer relapse, of which half was local. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Patients with Melanoma: Which Is Its Prognostic Value?
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oncological impact of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in melanoma remains controversial. We aimed to determine the significance of TILs on melanoma-specific survival (MSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and sentinel lymph node status (SLN). A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing melanoma resection during the period 2009-2019 was performed. Using the Melanoma Institute Australia grading system for TILs, the cohort was divided into two groups: group 1 (G1), patients with TILs grades 1, 2, or 3 and Group 2 (G2), patients with TILs grade 0. From a total of 386 melanoma resections, 151 (39%) were included in G1 and 39 (10%) in G2. Among the 151 patients who underwent SLN biopsy, the positivity rate according to the TILs grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 was 32%, 18%, 14%, and 0%, respectively, p = 0.02. With an average follow-up of 48 months, the 5-year MSS (G1: 86% vs G2: 75%, p = 0.002) and the 5-year RFS (G1: 81% vs G2: 60%, p = 0.004) were significantly higher in G1 than G2. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma are associated with the SLN status and with a better MSS and RFS.

TI  - Remote sensing-based estimation of rice yields using various models: A critical review
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Reliable estimation of region-wide rice yield is vital for food security and agricultural management. Field-scale models have increased our understanding of rice yield and its estimation under theoretical environmental conditions. However, they offer little information on spatial variability effects on farm-scale yield. Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool to upscale yield estimates from farm scales to regional levels. Much research used RS with rice models for reliable yield estimation. As several countries start to operationalize rice monitoring systems, it is needed to synthesize current literature to identify knowledge gaps, to improve estimation accuracies, and to optimize processing. This paper critically reviewed significant developments in using geospatial methods, imagery, and quantitative models to estimate rice yield. First, essential characteristics of rice were discussed as detected by optical and radar sensors, band selection, sensor configuration, spatial resolution, mapping methods, and biophysical variables of rice derivable from RS data. Second, various empirical, process-based, and semi-empirical models that used RS data for spatial estimation of yield were critically assessed - discussing how major types of models, RS platforms, data assimilation algorithms, canopy state variables, and RS variables can be integrated for yield estimation. Lastly, to overcome current constraints and to improve accuracies, several possibilities were suggested - adding new modeling modules, using alternative canopy variables, and adopting novel modeling approaches. As rice yields are expected to decrease due to global warming, geospatial rice yield estimation techniques are indispensable tools for climate change assessments. Future studies should focus on resolving the current limitations of estimation by precise delineation of rice cultivars, by incorporating dynamic harvesting indices based on climatic drivers, using innovative modeling approaches with machine learning.

TI  - Climate change and ecological engineering jointly induced vegetation greening in global karst regions from 2001 to 2020
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds Vegetation dynamics play a dominant role in the global carbon cycle and climate, especially in vulnerable karst ecosystem. Many studies have examined the past several decades changes in vegetation greenness and the associated with climate drivers. Yet, few studies have analyzed the vegetation change in global karst regions particularly in the last decades when climate change and anthropogenic disturbance widely occurred. Methods In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variations in vegetation dynamic using the Seasonally Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (SINDVI) and examined their relationship with climate changes using correlation analysis, the ordinary least squares method investigate the variation trends and the Mann-Kendal test to detect the turning points from 2001 to 2020. Results As expected, there were greening trends in global karst SINDVI from 2001 to 2020, with significant increasing trends in China (range = 0.836, P < 0.05), Europe (range = 0.456, P < 0.05) and many other regions. According to correlation analyses, SINDVI was water-limited in arid and semi-arid regions, such as Middle East and central Asia, and temperature-limited in northern high-latitude. Conclusions Our results suggest that anthropogenic activities were mainly responsible for the increasing vegetation greenness in tailoring management measures (e.g., Ecological Engineering, the Grain to Green Project) in China and Europe, and intensive farm in Middle East. Coupling warming temperature and increasing precipitation, southeastern Asia and Russia showed increasing trends in SINDVI. In general, climate factors were the dominant drivers for the variation in vegetation greenness in globally karst regions during research period.

TI  - Machine learning-enabled multitrust audit of stroke comorbidities using natural language processing
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose With the increasing adoption of electronic records in the health system, machine learning-enabled techniques offer the opportunity for greater computer-assisted curation of these data for audit and research purposes. In this project, we evaluate the consistency of traditional curation methods used in routine clinical practice against a new machine learning-enabled tool, MedCAT, for the extraction of the stroke comorbidities recorded within the UK's Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) initiative. Methods A total of 2327 stroke admission episodes from three different National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, between January 2019 and April 2020, were included in this evaluation. In addition, current clinical curation methods (SSNAP) and the machine learning-enabled method (MedCAT) were compared against a subsample of 200 admission episodes manually reviewed by our study team. Performance metrics of sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive value, and F1 scores are reported. Results The reporting of stroke comorbidities with current clinical curation methods is good for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, but poor for congestive cardiac failure. The machine learning-enabled method, MedCAT, achieved better performances across all four assessed comorbidities compared with current clinical methods, predominantly driven by higher sensitivity and F1 scores. Conclusions We have shown machine learning-enabled data collection can support existing clinical and service initiatives, with the potential to improve the quality and speed of data extraction from existing clinical repositories. The scalability and flexibility of these new machine-learning tools, therefore, present an opportunity to revolutionize audit and research methods.

TI  - Impact of spatial resolution on the quality of crop yield predictions for site-specific crop management
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven approaches hold great promise for better understanding of within-field crop yield variability. Data-driven models use spatiotemporal information that relate to plant growth and can be correlated with yield. Such data is available at different spatial resolutions so a decision is needed about what spatial resolution we should model at which can be determined based on the required management resolution; however, this does not always match the resolution of the input data. Prediction quality can change with spatial resolution. Therefore, this work focused on exploring changes in prediction quality with changes in the spatial resolution of predictors and the predictions. More specifically, this study investigated whether inputs should be resampled prior to modeling or the modeling implemented first with aggregation of predictions happening as a final step. The study consisted of 59 fields over six years in the south-west region of Australia. Rainfed canola, barley and wheat were used for this study. Data used for modeling were acquired from different sources. These data consisted of interpolated yield monitor data and soil sensor data, Landsat 8 data, elevation data, digital soil maps, and weather data. The first approach was based on resampling the inputs to four spatial resolutions (10, 30, 90 m and whole-field-average). The second approach was based on aggregating the outputs from the models which were built at 10, 30 and 90 m to the coarser resolutions and eventually to the whole-field-average. This study showed that the second approach (modeling at the highest resolution and aggregating the outputs to the whole field average) resulted in the highest Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) (0.87) and lowest RMSE (0.59 t ha(-1)). This study confirmed that better results can be obtained from machine learning models by following the appropriate approach to related to the spatial resolution resampling.

TI  - Seasonal impacts of buildings' energy consumption on the variation and spatial distribution of air pollutant over Kabul City: application of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI products
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air and environmental pollution are influenced by natural and anthropogenic activities. In addition, seasonal variations also affect the level of air pollutant concentration. Air pollution has a negative impact on climate, human-being health, and the environment. Monitoring of air pollution is a critical challenge in the world for better planning regarding its reduction. This study aims to monitor the impacts of seasonal diversity of buildings' energy consumption pattern on the tropospheric NO2, CO, and SO2 concentrations over the 22 districts of Kabul City. Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data was used for the space measurement of the selected tropospheric pollutant during the winter (December 2019, January, and February 2020) and summer (June, July, and August 2020) seasons. Google Earth Engine platform was used for the processing and analysis of data, and ArcGIS 10.7.1 was utilized for the plotting of thematic maps. This study's findings demonstrate that the tropospheric NO2, CO, and SO2 concentrations were reduced from the winter to the summer season. The main sources of NO2, CO, and SO2 pollutants are coal, wood, gas, and biomass burning, since these substances are consumed for heating purposes due to the cold weather during the winter season. Consequently, the results were validated using real-time data to test reliability. There was a high correlation between the output of this study and validation data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Conne River watershed is dominated by wetlands that provide valuable ecosystem services, including contributing to the survivability and propagation of Atlantic salmon, an important subsistence species that has shown a dramatic decline over the past 30 years. To better understand and improve the management of the watershed, and in turn, the Atlantic salmon, a wetland inventory of the area is developed using advanced remote sensing methods including field-collected data, object-based image analysis of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and digital elevation model Earth observation data. The resulting classification maps consisted of bog, fen, swamp, marsh, and open water wetlands with an overall accuracy of 92% and a kappa coefficient of 0.916. Among wetland classes, user and producer accuracies range between 84% and 100%. Results show the dominance of peatland wetlands such as bog and fen, and the relative rareness of marsh wetlands.

TI  - Predicting rice yield at pixel scale through synthetic use of crop and deep learning models with satellite data in South and North Korea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of rice yields at pixel scale rather than county scale can benefit crop management and scientific understanding because it is useful for monitoring how crop yields respond to various agricultural systems and environmental factors. In this study, we propose a methodology for the early prediction of rice yield at pixel scale combining a crop model and a deep learning model for different agricultural systems throughout South and North Korea. Initially, satellite-integrated crop models were applied to obtain a pixel-scale reference rice yield. Then, the pixel-scale reference rice yields were used as target labels in the deep learning model to leverage the advantages of crop models. Models of five different deep learning network architectures were employed to help determine the hybrid structure of long-short term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) layers by predicting the optimal model about two months ahead of harvest time. The suggested model showed good performance [R-2 = 0.859, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency = 0.858, root mean squared error = 0.605 Mg ha(-1)], with specific spatial patterns of rice yields for South and North Korea. Analysis of the relative importance of the input variables showed the water-related index and maximum temperature in North Korea and the vegetation indices and geographic variables in South Korea to be crucial for predicting rice yields. The proposed approach successfully predicted and diagnosed rice yield at the pixel scale for inaccessible locations where reliable ground measurements are not available, especially North Korea.

TI  - Interseismic Deformation From Sentinel-1 Burst-Overlap Interferometry: Application to the Southern Dead Sea Fault
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data are increasingly being used to map interseismic deformation with ascending and descending-orbit observations allowing for resolving the near-east and vertical displacement components. The north component has, however, been difficult to retrieve due to the limited sensitivity of standard InSAR observations in that direction. Here, we address this problem by using time-series analysis of along-track interferometric observations in burst-overlap areas of the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan imaging mode of the Sentinel-1 radar satellites. We apply this method to the southern part of the near-north striking Dead Sea transform fault to show that the similar to 5 mm/year relative motion is well recovered. Furthermore, the results indicate the locking depth of the fault decreases toward the south as it enters the transtensional Gulf of Aqaba basin. Our results show that time-series analysis of burst-overlap interferometric observations can be used to obtain meaningful interseismic deformation rates of slow-moving and northerly striking faults.Plain Language Summary Measurements of interseismic deformation near plate-boundary faults are used to estimate how large and how often major earthquakes are likely to occur and thus provide crucial input for regional seismic hazard assessments. Geodetic GPS data have primarily been used for this task, but increasingly Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations from satellites have provided useful information, particularly in areas where GPS observations are scarce. However, InSAR observations are only sensitive to the east and vertical components of deformation, but not to the north component, and are thus of limited use to study northerly striking earthquake faults. To address this problem, we combine an advanced processing technique called burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) with time-series analysis of a large data set to retrieve millimeter per year details of north-south deformation. We apply this method to the north-striking southern Dead Sea fault to show that the earthquake hazard decreases toward the south as the fault enters Gulf of Aqaba and approaches the Red Sea rift. Our study demonstrates that this method of BOI time-series analysis allows mapping the interseismic deformation of slow-moving and north-striking faults.

TI  - Nitrogen dioxide decline and rebound observed by GOME-2 and TROPOMI during COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its first confirmed case in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic with more than 90 million confirmed cases by January 2021. Countries around the world have enforced lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus, introducing a temporal change of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) that are strongly related to transportation, industry, and energy. In this study, NO2 variations over regions with strong responses to COVID-19 are analysed using datasets from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) sensor aboard the EUMETSAT Metop satellites and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the EU/ESA Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. The global GOME-2 and TROPOMI NO2 datasets are generated at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) using harmonized retrieval algorithms; potential influences of the long-term trend and seasonal cycle, as well as the short-term meteorological variation, are taken into account statistically. We present the application of the GOME-2 data to analyze the lockdown-related NO2 variations for morning conditions. Consistent NO2 variations are observed for the GOME-2 measurements and the early afternoon TROPOMI data: regions with strong social responses to COVID-19 in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America show strong NO2 reductions of similar to 30-50% on average due to restriction of social and economic activities, followed by a gradual rebound with lifted restriction measures.

TI  - Panchromatic and multispectral image fusion using the spatial frequency and the <i>a</i> <i>trous</i> wavelet transform
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a panchromatic (Pan) and multispectral (MS) image fusion method in order to synthesize an MS image with enhanced spatial resolution and preserved spectral information of the original MS image. The proposed method is based on the spatial frequency and the trous wavelet transform (SFATWT). The a trous wavelet transform (ATWT) is used to decompose Pan and MS images into low and high frequencies. The spatial frequency is exploited in the image fusion rules to improve the details or the high-frequency information which will be injected into the MS image. The ATWT reconstruction makes it possible to produce MS image with high spatial resolution. To validate the proposed method, two image sets are used. The first one is acquired by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) satellite with a resolution ratio of 2. The second one is the Algerian satellite AlSat 2A images with a resolution ratio of 4. The fused results are evaluated by means of qualitative and quantitative comparisons. The assessment of fused products has shown that the proposed method is promising. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a new statistically-robust adaptive regression method (SARM) to extract clear sky true color imagery, approximating the near-surface imagery, derived from multiple satellite daily imagery time series, while avoiding artifacts due to clouds and cloud shadows. We compare the SARM-derived near-surface imagery against simpler approaches for various surface types, and perform a quantitative evaluation. Existing mapped daily imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20, and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites is used to produce global clear sky near-surface imagery over various time intervals. We provide several examples of satellite-derived clear sky near-surface imagery over various regions to show potential applications. In addition, we apply this new method to derive clear sky near-surface imagery using higher spatial resolution Landsat-8 data, and discuss characteristics and limitations of our approach. The clear sky near-surface imagery is a useful satellite-derived product, representing the human perception of Earth's near-surface features, which can be more directly interpreted and easily understood by the general public, and aids visualization and interpretation of various types of satellite derived data.

AB  - Plasma density irregularities in the equatorial ionosphere are thought to cause the distortions of L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which have been observed in recent years, but the origin of the image distortion has not yet been clearly identified experimentally. We report on the first simultaneous observation of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) by the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 satellite and ground 630-nm airglow imager in northern Brazil. We observe stripe-like distortions of SAR signal power that are aligned in the direction of local magnetic field lines. The stripe-like patterns are observed in the vicinity of airglow depletion. The result shows that the observed L-band SAR stripes are caused by ionospheric scintillation due to plasma irregularities with the scale size of hundreds of meters associated with EPBs. We show that the SAR scintillation stripes are predominantly found at the location of sharp density gradients in the two-dimensional form.

TI  - Reappraisal of DEMs, Radar and optical datasets in lineaments extraction with emphasis on the spatial context
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineaments mapping is an authentic issue for deciphering the tectonic setting, geological history, mineral pro-specting, and other several applications. Consequently, the study objective is to examine various remote sensing datasets at wide various spatial resolutions (10, 12.5, 15, 20, 30 m), to recommend the best in lineaments elicitation, for usage in the geological scientific community. Toward this aim, nine various remote sensing datasets including optical sensors (Landsat OLI, ASTER, Earth Observing-1 Advanced Land Imager, Sentinel 2A), radar data (Sentinel 1), and digital elevation models (ALOS PALSAR, SRTM, NASA, ASTER V3), are tackled. In this scope, we created an entirely automatic lineament derivation environment through the integration of edge detection and line-linking algorithms. Results show that the used optical sensors are less efficient than DEMs having the same spatial resolution. Sentinel 1 radar data is more competent than optical data sources. ALOS PALSAR DEM (12.5m) is more eligible than any other utilized data type even sentinel 1 data (10 m). Wholly, DEMs built from radar data (e.g., PALSAR DEM) proved their leverage in lineament extraction to a limit that can deviate from the well-known relationship between the number of extracted lineaments and pixel size.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of wildfires in Siberia during 2001-2020
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Siberia is one of the most fire-prone regions of northern Eurasia and also the region with the greatest warming in the Eastern Hemisphere over the last decades. In this study, spatiotemporal features of wildfires in Siberia and their recent trends and relationship with air temperature and precipitation during 2001-2020 were investigated. The main results show that the annual burned area (BA) in Siberia during the study period is 6.5 Mha with a non-significant positive trend (58 kha year(-1), p = 0.49), but analysis of the spatial patterns revealed regions with significant trends in BA: negative in the south of Western Siberia (-17 kha year(-1), p < 0.05) and positive in the center of Eastern Siberia (10 kha year(-1), p < 0.05). Positive trends of BA in Eastern Siberia were accompanied by a positive air temperature trend (0.11 degrees C year(-1)) and a negative precipitation trend (-1.64 mm year(-1)) in June.

TI  - High-resolution aerosol retrieval over urban areas using sentinel-2 data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from satellite remote sensing images over urban areas is of great importance, e.g. for air-quality monitoring. However, limited by coarse spatial resolution, available aerosol products are unable to fulfil the increasing demand of aerosol retrieval below the city scale. To address this issue, a new high-resolution (60 m) aerosol retrieval algorithm based on Sentinel-2 data over urban areas was developed. To improve the estimation of surface reflectance, two algorithms: (1) the new visible/2.19 mu m surface reflectance relationships as a function of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for vegetated areas; and (2) the surface reflectance database preconstructed from the operational high-quality and highresolution Landsat 8 surface reflectance products for bright areas, were adopted depending on the surface types. For validation, the derived retrievals from Sentinel-2, along with the operational MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer Collection 6 (C6) aerosol products (MOD04_L2 and MCD19A2), were compared with measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations. The validation results show that the Sentinel2 AOD retrievals agreed well with the AERONET AOD measurements, with an overall correlation coefficient of 0.907, expected error (EE) of 73.76%, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.087, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.117. Comparison of the results with MOD04_L2 products (10 km) show that the Sentinel-2 AODs were superior in the situations considered, indicating that the new algorithm performed better in AOD retrieval over urban areas. Compared with the fine spatial resolution MCD19A2 products (1 km), retrievals of the proposed algorithm were comparable. The new algorithm is able to retrieve high-resolution AODs reasonably well from Sentinel-2 images over urban areas, and can provide continuous and detailed aerosol spatial distributions. Owing to the ability of the Sentinel-2 satellite to provide observations at 5-day intervals, the proposed algorithm is capable of monitoring aerosol distributions at relatively fine temporal resolution.

TI  - A machine learning-based method to account for 3D Short-Wave radiative effects in 1D satellite observation operators
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation of Short-Wave (SW, <= 4 mu m) satellite radiance in cloudy regions could potentially improve cloud forecasts. Operational SW observation operators neglect cloud 3D radiative effects, which may cause nonnegligible errors in some circumstances, for example, with large solar zenith angles or for broken clouds. This study introduced a machine learning (ML)-based method to include some cloud 3D radiative effects in a 1D observation operator based on liquid water cloud simulations by the Weather Research and Forecasting model and radiative transfer simulations by the Spherical Harmonics Discrete Ordinate Method. The inputs of the ML correction method include the reflectance simulated by a 1D observation operator at the targeting column, cloud top height, cloud water content, and effective particle size at its adjacent columns, and other ancillary information (sun-viewing geometries, water vapor conditions, etc.). Preliminary results were presented for the channel 3 (0.75 similar to 0.90 mu m) of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard FY-4A. Compared with 1D simulations, the ML correction method could reduce the biases from 6.9% similar to 11.7% to 2.0% similar to 4.7% and the root mean square errors from 22.3% similar to 34.8% to 15.4% similar to 27.4%. The elapsed CPU time for the ML correction method is approximately the same or two times that of the 1D observation operators, depending on whether atmospheric gases are included or not. In general, the ML correction method is computationally more efficient than traditional 3D radiative transfer solver, and could be used to correct current 1D observation operators' simulations.

TI  - Monitoring agroecosystem productivity and phenology at a national scale: A metric assessment framework
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective measurement of seasonal variations in the timing and amount of production is critical to managing spatially heterogeneous agroecosystems in a changing climate. Although numerous technologies for such mea-surements are available, their relationships to one another at a continental extent are unknown. Using data collected from across the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network and other networks, we investigated correlations among key metrics representing primary production, phenology, and carbon fluxes in croplands, grazing lands, and crop-grazing integrated systems across the continental U.S. Metrics we examined included gross primary productivity (GPP) estimated from eddy covariance (EC) towers and modelled from the Landsat satellite, Landsat NDVI, and vegetation greenness (Green Chromatic Coordinate, GCC) from tower-mounted PhenoCams for 2017 and 2018. Overall, our analysis compared production dynamics estimated from three independent ground and remote platforms using data for 34 agricultural sites constituting 51 site-years of co-located time series.Pairwise sensor comparisons across all four metrics revealed stronger correlation and lower root mean square error (RMSE) between end of season (EOS) dates (Pearson R ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 and RMSE from 32.5 to 67.8) than start of season (SOS) dates (0.46 to 0.69 and 40.4 to 66.2). Overall, moderate to high correlations between SOS and EOS metrics complemented one another except at some lower productivity grazing land sites where estimating SOS can be challenging. Growing season length estimates derived from 16-day satellite GPP (179.1 days) were significantly longer than those from PhenoCam GCC (70.4 days, padj < 0.0001) and EC GPP (79.6 days, padj < 0.0001). Landscape heterogeneity did not explain differences in SOS and EOS estimates. Annual integrated estimates of productivity from EC GPP and PhenoCam GCC diverged from those estimated by Landsat GPP and NDVI at sites where annual production exceeds 1000 gC/m(-2) yr(-1). Based on our results, we developed a "metric assessment framework" that articulates where and how metrics from satellite, eddy covariance and PhenoCams complement, diverge from, or are redundant with one another. The framework was designed to optimize instrumentation selection for monitoring, modeling, and forecasting ecosystem functioning with the ultimate goal of informing decision-making by land managers, policy-makers, and industry leaders working at multiple scales.

TI  - Monitoring temperate forest degradation on Google Earth Engine using Landsat time series analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Current estimates of forest degradation are associated with large uncertainties. However, recent advancements in the availability of remote sensing data (e.g., the free data policies of the Landsat and Sentinel Programs) and cloud computing platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)) provide new opportunities for monitoring forest degradation. Several recent studies focus on monitoring forest degradation in the tropics, particularly the Amazon, but there are less studies of temperate forest degradation. Compared to the Amazon, temperate forests have more seasonality, which complicates satellite-based monitoring. Here, we present an approach, Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis (CCDC-SMA), that combines time series analysis and spectral mixture analysis running on GEE for monitoring abrupt and gradual forest degradation in temperate regions. We used this approach to monitor forest degradation and deforestation from 1987 to 2019 in the country of Georgia. Reference conditions were observed at sample locations selected under stratified random sampling for area estimation and accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of our map was 91%. The user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of the forest degradation class were 69% and 83%, respectively. The sampling-based area estimate with 95% confidence intervals of forest degradation was 3541 +/- 556 km(2) (11% of the forest area in 1987), which was significantly larger than the area estimate of deforestation, 158 +/- 98 km(2). Our approach successfully mapped forest degradation and estimated the area of forest degradation in Georgia with small uncertainty, which earlier studies failed to estimate.

TI  - Aerosol optical properties derived from POLDER-3/PARASOL (2005-2013) over the Western Mediterranean Sea - Part 2: Spatial distribution and temporal variability
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean atmosphere is impacted by a variety of natural and anthropogenic aerosols which exert a complex and variable pressure on the regional climate and air quality. This study focuses on the Western Mediterranean Sea (west of longitude 20 degrees E) using the full POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances version 3 (POLDER-3)/Polarization & Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) aerosol data record derived from the operational clear-sky ocean algorithm (collection 3) available from March 2005 to October 2013. This 8.5-year satellite data set includes retrievals at 865 nm of the total, fine-, and coarse-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD, AOD(F), and AOD(C), respectively), Angstrom exponent (AE), and the spherical/nonspherical partition of the coarse-mode AOD (AOD(CS) and AOD(CNS), respectively), that have been carefully validated over the study region (Formenti et al., 2018). Here, we analyze the spatial distribution, the seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of this ensemble of advanced aerosol products in three latitude bands (34-38, 38-42, and > 42 degrees N) and for three sites (Ersa, Barcelona, Lampedusa) distributed on the western basin. POLDER-3 retrieves the high influence of north African desert dust over the region, which largely controls the spatial distributions (south-to-north decreasing gradient) and seasonal cycles (spring/summer maximum) of both AOD and coarse AOD, including its non-spherical component. In contrast, the coarse spherical component of AOD remains relatively homogenously low all year long over the region, whereas fine-mode AODs are generally more elevated in the eastern part of the region of study, especially north of the Adriatic Sea. From 2005 to 2013, annual POLDER-3 AOD evolution shows a decreasing trend of 0.0030 yr(-1) in absolute value at 865 nm (0.0060 yr(-1) at 550 nm). Such a downward evolution is much more pronounced and spatially extended for AODF (-0.0020 yr(-1) at 865 nm) than for AODC. Our analysis also suggests that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index explains a significant part of the interannual variability of POLDER-3 AODC, reflecting its role on the frequency of Saharan dust transport over the region. Finally, the POLDER-3 data set highlights an improvement of air quality related to the fine aerosol component, with a marked evolution toward more frequent occurrence of clean conditions (>= 75% of daily AOD(F-865 nm) < 0.05) at the end of the period of study (2010-2013) over most of the Western Mediterranean Sea, and much less evidence of such a large-scale evolution for the coarse fraction. Therefore, despite the high and variable influence of mostly natural north African dust over the region, the POLDER-3 advanced aerosol data set appears sufficiently accurate to successfully resolve the concurrent downward trend of fine, primarily anthropogenic particles, most likely related to reduced emissions in the surrounding European countries.

TI  - 20 years MODIS-NDVI monitoring suggests that vegetation has increased significantly around Tehri Dam reservoir, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large dams have immediate impact on surrounding riparian vegetation due to inundation by reservoir. The effect however may vary beyond impoundment region in an undulating topography. Present work assesses the vegetational changes between years 2000 and 2019, around Tehri dam reservoir area across elevation zones. The work uses 20 years Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI), and covers over 1600 km(2) around one of the world's highest dams built in the western Himalayas. The study area is divided into 13 different zones. Each zone has a 100 m altitudinal difference; from 815 m up to 2015 m altitude. It is observed that in the first (impoundment) zone there is a significant decline in vegetation in last 20 years. Beyond this zone, a significant increase in vegetation up to 1515 m altitude is recorded. The geographical area from reservoir up to this altitude is around 700 km(2). Although vegetation beyond 1515 m exhibits an increasing trend but the increase is not statistically significant (confidence interval < 90%). The overall NDVI exhibits an annual increase of 0.0011 for the last 20 years. It is concluded that the negative impact of reservoir on vegetation is limited up to 815 m altitude while the positive impact is observed between 815 m and 1515 m. No significant impact is observed above 1515 m.

TI  - Space-time monitoring of water quality in an eutrophic reservoir using SENTINEL-2 data-A case study of San Roque, Argentina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophic reservoirs are characterized by excessive presence of plant and algal growth due to favourable environmental conditions, temperature, light and nutrients. Human activities accelerate this phenomenon and provoke dramatic changes to the aquatic ecosystems. The monitoring of water quality of these ecosystems and the study of the effects they have on the environment demand a large amount of spatial and temporal information, which is almost exclusively provided by Earth Observations (EO). This study uses a large temporal series of Sentinel-2 (S2; 2016 till 2019) images to characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a [Chla] in San Roque Reservoir, Cordoba Province, Argentina. A robust method that combines empirical modelling of [Chl-a] and data mining analysis is employed. Model results showed significant fit (R2 = 0.77) between [Chl-a] measured in the reservoir and the ratio between the NIR and red bands of S2. An analysis of spatio-temporal patterns demonstrated that [Chl-a] distribution in San Roque is complex and influenced by seasonal changes, aeolian forces, hydrodynamic flows, bathymetry, water levels, and pollution sources. The study also found a correlation between algae bloom events and areas with extreme levels of [Chl-a] (>850 mg/m3) in the water body. Additionally, advanced data mining tools such as slope analysis and spatial anomalies indexes, identified regions in the reservoir where water quality had improved or deteriorated. The results show the added value of using large Sentinel-2 data series to assess the concentration of Chlorophyll-a in eutrophic reservoirs over a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Association Between Racial Disparities in Hospital Length of Stay and the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
T2  - HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND MANAGERIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: On average Black patients have longer LOS than comparable White patients. Longer hospital length of stay (LOS) may be associated with higher readmission risk. However, evidence suggests that the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) reduced overall racial differences in 30-day adjusted readmission risk. Yet, it is unclear whether the HRRP narrowed these LOS racial differences. Objective: We examined the relationship between Medicare-insured Black-White differences in average, adjusted LOS (ALOS) and the HRRP's implementation and evaluation periods. Methods: Using 2009-2017 data from State Inpatient Dataset from New York, New Jersey, and Florida, we employed an interrupted time series analysis with multivariate generalized regression models controlling for patient, disease, and hospital characteristics. Results are reported per 100 admissions. Results: We found that for those discharged home, Black-White ALOS differences significantly widened by 4.15 days per 100 admissions (95% CI: 1.19 to 7.11, P < 0.001) for targeted conditions from before to after the HRRP implementation period, but narrowed in the HRRP evaluation period by 1.84 days per 100 admissions for every year-quarter (95% CI: -2.86 to -0.82, P < 0.001); for those discharged to non-home destinations, there was no significant change between HRRP periods, but ALOS differences widened over the study period. Black-White ALOS differences for non-targeted conditions remained unchanged regardless of HRRP phase and discharge destination. Conclusion: Increased LOS for Black patients may have played a role in reducing Black-White disparities in 30-day readmission risks for targeted conditions among patients discharged to home.

TI  - Screening approaches for identifying fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: A systematic review
T2  - ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and associated with a range of cognitive, affective, and health concerns. Although the identification of FASD can facilitate the provision of interventions and support, and plays a protective role against adverse outcomes, there are high rates of missed detection. The identification of FASD via screening may improve its recognition across settings. The current systematic review examined the available evidence on FASD screening tools and approaches across age groups and settings. Methods A systematic search was carried out for both peer-reviewed studies and gray literature sources published between January 1990 and May 2020 and was preregistered with PROSPERO (#CRD42019122077). Studies included in the review focused on human applications of FASD screening in children, adolescents, and adults. The quality of the studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 and GRADE frameworks. Results The search yielded 20 screening tools and approaches across 45 studies, broadly characterized in 2 groups. The first group included approaches currently in use that aim to identify individuals at risk of FASD using a range of markers (n = 19) or associated sentinel dysmorphic facial features (n = 6). Another group of studies, characterized as emerging, focused on identifying promising biomarkers of PAE/FASD (n = 20). Overall, we identified limited research supporting the psychometric properties of most screening approaches. The quality review provided evidence of bias due to the common use of case-control designs and lack of adequate reference standards. Conclusions Although several FASD screening tools and approaches are available for use across a range of age groups and settings, the overall evidence base supporting their psychometric properties is weak, with most studies demonstrating significant risk of bias. Service providers should exercise caution in selecting and implementing FASD screening tools given these limitations. It is critically important to accurately identify individuals with FASD across ages and settings to support healthy outcomes. Thus, there is a pressing need for additional research in this area, particularly validation studies in large and representative samples using robust methodological approaches.

TI  - Preventative pest management in field crops influences the biological control potential of epigeal arthropods and soil-borne entomopathogenic fungi
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Field crop growers in the United States have adopted prophylactic pest management strategies to control sporadic crop pests that are spatially and temporally difficult to predict. While evidence shows these preventative management practices, specifically pesticidal seed treatments, can be important in regions with predictable pest pressures, employing them ubiquitously in field crops across the northeastern U.S. can have variable returns on productivity. Further, prophylactics may also limit the potential of integrated pest management (IPM). A threeyear field experiment (2017-2019) was conducted in a maize-soybean cropping system to compare the influence of a preventative pest management practice and a scouting-based IPM practice on biological control organisms. Aboveground predator densities were measured via pitfall trapping and predation temporal dynamics were assessed using a standard sentinel-bait assay at two time points per year. Belowground biological control potential was determined using a sentinel-bait bioassay to quantify the abundance of soil-borne entomopathogenic fungi (EPF). The variable responses of beneficial communities to pesticide inputs were strongly influenced by season and time of application, underscoring the importance of applying pesticides only when necessary. Compared with no pesticide use, pesticidal seed treatments and foliar sprays together in a maize-soybean production system suppressed total predator activity-density, spider activity-density, predation, and infection potential of soil-borne entomopathogenic fungi in one out of three years of the field study. In the third year, the activity-density of spiders increased across all fields in preventative plots that included seed treatments only. Overall, the use of pesticides did not improve crop yield in either maize or soybean. These findings highlight that the use of a prophylactic pesticide program may not always be necessary for maximum crop productivity and that this management approach can occasionally have unintended negative consequences on above- and belowground soil biota and the ecosystem services they provide.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of Para-aortic lymph node metastasis in uterine cervical cancer: diagnostic accuracy and impact on clinical decision making
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The main aim of this study was to ascertain the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (US-FNAC) in the diagnosis of para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis in uterine cervical cancer and to establish its potential impact on clinical therapeutic decision making. Methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 92 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer with PALN enlargement between 2010 and 2018. Cytological results obtained with US-FNAC were classified by the same experienced cellular pathologists. Diagnostic indicators were determined on the basis of biopsy, imaging and clinical follow-up results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the differences of influencing factors. The effect of US-FNAC on clinical decision making was evaluated. Results Cytological results of US-FNAC were categorized as malignancy (n = 62; 67.4%), suspicious malignancy (n = 11; 12.0%), undetermined (n = 5; 5.4%), benign (n = 10; 10.9%), and inadequate (n = 4; 4.3%). Satisfactory biopsy samples were obtained from 95.7% of PALNs sampled (88/92). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of FNAC in distinguishing benign from malignant cases were 90.1% (95% CI: 0.809-0.953), 100% (95% CI: 0.561-1), 100% (95% CI: 0.938-1), 46.7% (95% CI: 0.223-0.726) and 90.9% (95% CI: 0.848-0.970), respectively. Univariate analysis indicated significant differences in experience of puncture physicians (radiologists) between the correct and wrong diagnosis groups (P < 0.05), which was further confirmed as an independent predictor of diagnostic accuracy in multivariate analysis (p = 0.031, OR = 0.077, 95% CI: 0.354-0.919). All patients tolerated the US-FNAC procedure well and only nine presented slight abdominal discomfort. The therapeutic strategies for 74 patients (80.4%) were influenced by US-FNAC findings. Conclusions US-FNAC was a relatively safe and effective technique for examination of enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes and may therefore serve as a routine diagnostic tool to guide clinical decision making for management of cervical cancer.

TI  - Simulating the hydrological regime of the snow fed and glaciarised Gilgit Basin in the Upper Indus using global precipitation products and a data parsimonious precipitation-runoff model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In many high altitude river basins, the hydro-climatic regimes and the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation are little known, complicating efforts to quantify current and future water availability. Scarce, or non-existent, gauged observations at high altitudes coupled with complex weather systems and orographic effects further prevent a realistic and comprehensive assessment of precipitation. Quantifying the contribution from seasonal snow and glacier melt to the river runoff for a high altitude, melt dependent region is especially difficult. Global scale precipitation products, in combination with precipitation-runoff modelling may provide insights to the hydro-climatic regimes for such data scarce regions. In this study two global precipitation products; the high resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees), newly developed ERA5-Land, and a coarser resolution (0.55 degrees x 0.55 degrees) JRA-55, are used to simulate snow/glacier melts and runoff for the Gilgit Basin, a sub-basin of the Indus. A hydrological precipitation-runoff model, the Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD), requires minimum input data and was developed for snow dominated catchments. The mean of total annual precipitation from 1995 to 2010 data was estimated at 888 mm and 951 mm by ERA5-Land and JRA-55, respectively. The daily runoff simulation obtained a Kling Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.78 and 0.72 with ERA5-Land and JRA-55 based simulations, respectively. The simulated snow cover area (SCA) was validated using MODIS SCA and the results are quite promising on daily, monthly and annual scales. Our result showed an overall contribution to the river flow as about 26% from rainfall, 37-38% from snow melt, 31% from glacier melt and 5% from soil moisture. These melt simulations are in good agreement with the overall hydro-climatic regimes and seasonality of the area. The proxy energy balance approach in the DDD model, used to estimate snow melt and evapotranspiration, showed robust behaviour and potential for being employed in data poor basins.

TI  - Modelling of the biodiversity of tropical forests in China based on unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral and light detection and ranging data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate monitoring of biodiversity is a major challenge in biodiversity conservation. Obtaining data using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a new direction for biodiversity monitoring. However, studies on the relationship between UAV data and biodiversity are limited. In this study, we used a machine learning algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of UAV-light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and UAV multispectral data for estimating three alpha-diversity indices in tropical forests located in Hainan, China. We obtained 126 biodiversity-related metrics (68 from multispectral and 58 from LiDAR) based on the UAV data and three alpha-diversity indices from 62 sample plots at two sites. We used the recursive feature elimination algorithm to filter significant metrics. We found that both multispectral and LiDAR data can be used to predict alpha-diversity. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of multispectral data (LiDAR data) for the species richness, Shannon index, and Simpson index were 0.69, 0.70, and 0.57 (0.72, 0.63, 0.44), respectively. LiDAR data were more accurate than multispectral data for predicting species richness, whereas multispectral data were more accurate than LiDAR data for predicting the Shannon and Simpson indices. Given the best result obtained with a single datum, the accuracy (R-2) of the combination of the two data types for species richness and Shannon and Simpson indices increased by 0.05, 0.05, and 0.06, respectively, indicating that the prediction accuracy of the alpha-diversity index can be improved by integrating different remote sensing data. Additionally, the most important multispectral metrics used to predict alpha-diversity were related to vegetation index and texture metrics, whereas the most important LiDAR metrics were related to canopy height characteristics. Our research results indicate that UAV data are effective for predicting the alpha-diversity index of Hainan tropical forest on a fine scale. UAV data may help local biodiversity workers to identify vulnerable areas.

TI  - Detecting Chamoli landslide precursors in the southern Himalayas using remote sensing data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 7 February 2021, a catastrophic flood destroyed two hydropower plants, killing at least 150 people in the Himalayan Uttarakhand state of India. This flood was reportedly initiated by a high-position landslide. This work explored the capability of using Sentinel-2 images to diagnose the landslide trigger of this event. There were 264 Sentinel-2 images taken before the landslide, 111 of which are clear. In a pre-landslide Sentinel-2 image, tensile cracks are clearly visible on the landslide head. In the post-landslide image acquired on 10 February 2021, a fresh landslide scarp stripped of snow is visible, indicating that a high-position landslide occurred that may have led to the disaster in the downstream areas. The landslide was initiated at an elevation of similar to 5600 m, slid to the valley floor (similar to 3800 m elevation) and scooped up an unconsolidated mixture of moraine, ice and water that wreaked havoc on local infrastructure. To derive the slope deformation that occurred before the landslide, we selected 15 Sentinel-2 images to compose 10 image pairs. To filter out background noise, we developed a new method to derive reliable slope deformation results. We found that the slope was consistently moving since 2016, after which it moved at least 25 m. We speculated that the slope instability was caused by the seasonal freeze-thaw process. With the impacts of climate warming, more similar hazard chains are expected in the Himalayan region. The regular monitoring of slope stabilities in the Himalayan Mountains and beyond is urgently needed for regional sustainability.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation and prediction of land use based on CA-Markov of southwestern coastal district of Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to explore the spatio-temporal variation of land use of Satkhira district, one of the most vulnerable coastal districts of south-western Bangladesh, to monitor environmental degradation. Satkhira district experienced a significant change in its natural setting due to natural disasters, cyclones in precise, and unplanned and unwise human interventions. This study analyzed the Landsat Level 2 images of the years 1989, 2001, and 2018 to detect the change in land use in seven Upazilas of Satkhira district. Integration of remote sensing indices and Supervised Classification was employed to classify the Landsat images and identify the change in four dominant land use classes named 'Bare Lands', 'Built-Up Area', 'Vegetation', and 'Water Area'. The analysis revealed that 'Bare Lands' has been declined at an alarming rate between 1989 and 2001 (67.61%), and between 2001 and 2018 (77.38%). On the other hand, 'Water Area' has increased by 291.8% over the last 30 years, grabbing more than 510 sq. km from other land use classes. A substantial change in 'Water Area' occurred from 1989 to 2001 (138.13%) compared to the period of 2001-2018 (64.58%). The most significant conversion (more than 240 sq. km) has taken place between 'Bare Lands' and 'Water Area'. This analysis supports the positive growth of Shrimp and Crab farming, and occupational shifting from agricultural production to Shrimp farming in Satkhira. Flourishing Shrimp farming has negatively affected the coastal region by triggering the salinity intrusion and loss of agricultural lands. Population distribution maps of 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011 indicated that population density has been increasing in the Upper portion of Satkhira, which supports the studies of migration towards urban areas from coastal villages. There is a close interconnection between the distribution of land use types and population among the Upazilas. Land use distribution of 2030 was predicted through the CAMarkov model, which disclosed that 'Water Area' will continue to increase by 29.7% and 'Vegetation' areas will face a reduction by 16.7% between 2018 and 2030. 'Bare Lands' will experience a further 90.4% reduction. The coastal natural setting has already been disrupted due to natural disasters and human interventions. An integrated land use management plan should be formulated immediately to control the unplanned development soon and this study will guide to formulation of the plan.

TI  - Effect of land use change on summertime surface temperature, albedo, and evapotranspiration in Las Vegas Valley
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban surfaces affect the surface energy budget, which plays a defining role in outdoor water requirements changing an area's evapotranspiration. They also affect thermal comfort levels for humans, animals, and vegetation by causing the surface temperature to vary. This study analyzes the effects of land use change on the surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), and evapotranspiration (ET) of the arid Las Vegas Valley (LVV). The changes in land use considered include transitions from barren and rural surfaces into urban surfaces covered with residential, commercial buildings, roadways, and turf grass. The impacts of these changes were determined by analyzing trends over the summer periods from 1990 to 2017. Remote sensing data acquired by Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat satellite were used to retrieve various geophysical characteristics, including albedo and LST. The ET was estimated using the Mapping of Evapotranspiration using Internal Calibration (METRIC) model with remote sensing input data. The geophysical characteristic trends, in response to urban land use change, were quantified using Mann Kendall's trend analysis.The results showed that commercial buildings and roadways are the main contributors to increased LST. Land use change from rural to commercial buildings decreased surface albedo by 0.4 +/- 0.01 with a Sen's slope (S) of 0.001-0.003 units/summer/year, and increased temperature by 7 +/- 0.2 K with S = 0.2 and 0.4 K/summer/year. Turf grass removal increased temperatures by 20 +/- 0.3 K, while urbanization, in general, increased LST by 5 +/- 0.3 K. Roadway surfaces, primarily covered with asphalt, were the main contributors to temperature increase of LST 17 +/- 0.1 K and S = 0.2-0.8 K/summer/year, while decreasing albedo by 1 +/- 0.01 with S = 0.001-0.003 units/summer/year. Turf grass development maintained LST in the valley throughout the study period, showing significant ET increase (S = 0.04-0.06 mm/summer/year), with an average increase of 1 +/- 0.07 mm/day. This study can help water managers and urban planners to understand the role of land use change in irrigation water demand and urban thermal comfort.

TI  - Estimating the burden of pediatric HIV in an 'A' category district in India: an epidemiological study
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background India lacks epidemiological information on the disease burden of pediatric HIV. The National AIDS Control Program (NACP) estimates the numbers of HIV-positive children as a proportion of adult persons living with HIV. A third of HIV-positive children die before their first birthday and a half before they reach their second birthday. The early detection of HIV is crucial for the prevention of morbidities, growth delays, and death among HIV-positive children. Methods The study aimed to estimate the disease burden of pediatric HIV among children in 'A' category district of a high HIV prevalence state. An 'A' category district is defined by the presence of > 1% HIV prevalence among the general population, as estimated by HIV Sentinel Surveillance. The study used an innovative three-pronged strategy combining cross-sectional and longitudinal methods. The overall burden of pediatric HIV was calculated as a product of cases detected multiplied by a net inflation factor, for each of three strategies. Results The existing pool of HIV infection in the district is estimated to be 3266 (95% CI: 2621-4197) HIV positive children < 15 years of age, in a mid-year (2013) projected child population of about 1.4 million, thus giving an HIV prevalence of 0.23% (CI: 0.19-0.30) among children (0-14 years of age). The proportion of children among all people living with HIV in the district works out to 10.4% (CI: 8.6-13.5%). Conclusions The study estimate of 0.23% HIV prevalence among children (0-14 years of age) is higher than the NACP estimates (0.02) and is 2.5 higher than the Karnataka state estimate (0.09)(22). Similarly, the proportion of children among all persons living with HIV in Belgaum district is 10.4% in this study, as against 6.54% for India. The study methodology is replicable for other settings and other diseases.

TI  - Large scale mapping of soil organic carbon concentration with 3D machine learning and satellite observations
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Canada has extensive forests and peatlands that play key roles in global carbon cycle. Canadian soils and peatlands are assumed to store approximately 20% of the world's soil carbon stock. However, the spatial and vertical distributions of the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in Canada have not been systematically investigated. SOC concentration, expressed in g C KG(-1) soil, affects the chemical and physical properties of the soil, such as water infiltration ability, moisture holding capacity, nutrient availability, and the biological activity of microorganisms. In this study, we tested a three dimensional (3D) machine learning approach and 40 spatial predictors derived from 20 years of optical and microwave satellite observations to estimate the spatial and vertical distributions of SOC concentration in Canada in six depth intervals up to 1 m. A quantile regression forest method was used to build an uncertainty map showing 80% of prediction intervals. Results showed that a random forest model associated with 25 covariates was successful in capturing 83% of spatial and vertical SOC variation over the country. Soil depth was the most important covariate to predict SOC concentration, followed by surface temperature and elevation. The SOC concentration in forested areas was highest in the top layers (0-5 cm), but soils located in peatlands showed higher C concentration in all soil depths. Among the terrestrial ecozones of Canada, Pacific Maritime and the Hudson Plain mostly covered by forest trees and peatlands, respectively, show highest SOC concentration, while the lowest concentration are observed in the Prairies and Mixed Wood Plain ecosystems that are the agricultural areas of the country. This study provides a deeper understanding of the major factors controlling SOC concentration in Canada and shows potential areas with high carbon reserves, which are crucial in view of the ongoing climate change. In addition, the presented methodological framework has great potential to be used in future soil carbon storage inventories using satellite observations. Mapping SOC concentration and associated uncertainties in Canada are fundamental to detect trends of gains or losses in SOC linked to recent and future national or global policy decisions related to soil quality and carbon sequestration.

TI  - Exposure to queer characters in Konigsberg's <i>Openly Straight</i> through social messaging
T2  - LITERATOR-JOURNAL OF LITERARY CRITICISM COMPARATIVE LINGUISTICS AND LITERARY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Research conducted by The Other Foundation has indicated that South Africans view the lives of queer individuals as lifestyle choice (34%), illness (12%), sin (5.10%), results of these individuals' upbringing (3.80%) and/or resulting from the influence of ancestral spirits (3.70%). Advocacy and information about sexual orientation and sexual diversity through literary as characters may be instrumental in possibly changing negative perceptions of queer individuals. This article aims to show how a selected young adult queer novel, and the social messaging that emerges from the text, may be a potentially influential location for creating an awareness and better understanding of queer individuals. The aim of the investigation on which the article is based was to examine the possibility or viability of implementing critical literacy in secondary education systems in the language classroom as an opportunity to address social issues in heteronormative environments. The social messages found in queer texts may be used as entry points to fruitful discourse in language classroom environments. The study followed a qualitative approach with the use of critical hermeneutics as a strategy of inquiry and social constructivism as philosophical worldview. The queer text utilised was Openly Straight (2013) by Bill Konigsberg with the method of data generation being document analysis. The main findings were that queer texts should form part of the language classroom (as learners may read these texts critically and emphatically) and that Bill Konigsberg's Openly Straight contained social messages that can contribute to positive influences on queer- and heterosexual readers.

TI  - Enhanced urban functional land use map with free and open-source data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims at developing an applicable methodology to produce the functional land-use map using only free and open-source data. Top-view Sentinel image and ground-view Open Street Map (OSM) data are chosen due to their extensive availability. The three-stage framework, including object-based image analysis, OSM data cleaning, and ontology-based decision fusion, is proposed and implemented with open-source tools. We applied the developed approach to districts 1, 4, and 7 of HoChiMinh city, representing the complexities of the dynamic change in big cities. The result showed a good functional land use map with 78.70% overall accuracy. The outcome presents the mismatch between the data-driven approach and human knowledge, which can be improved by ontology-based fusion with OSM data. The ontology-based framework comprises the common urban land-use classes and OSM attributes, which can be applied and extended in other urban areas. Additional text attributes may be applicable only locally and can be modified in our open-source framework. Object-based image analysis takes advantage of Google Earth Engine computing power, whereas ontology-based processing works well on a local computer. In future studies, adopted natural language processing to pre-process OSM data and ontology-based fusion will be implemented on the cloud-computing platform to enhance computational efficiency.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in early-stage cervical cancer Meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for early-stage cervical cancer remains controversial. Therefore, we collected data to investigate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of SLN in patients with early-stage (IA-IIA) cervical cancer. Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases issued before June 1, 2020. The sample size of the selected study was at least 10 patients with early-stage (IA-IIA) cervical cancer, the pooled detection rates and the separate detection rate (overall detection rate, bilateral detection rate) using blue dye with Tc, technetium 99 (Tc) and indocyanine green (ICG) technique of early-stage cervical cancer was reported. R-3.6.1 software was used to evaluate pooled detection rate and sensitivity. Results: Two thousand one hundred sixty-four patients included for analysis in 28 studies ranging from 12 to 405 patients. The combined overall detection rate of SLN mapping was 95% with a 72% pooled bilateral detection rate. The sensitivity of the combined overall detection rate of SLN mapping was 94.99% as well as a sensitivity of 72.43% bilateral detection rate. The overall detection rate of SLN was 96% for blue dye with Tc, 95% for Tc, 98% for ICG technique. The bilateral detection rate of SLN was 76% for blue dye with Tc, 63% for Tc, 85% for ICG technique. The sensitivity of the overall detection rate of SLN mapping was 97.76% as well as a sensitivity of 84.96% bilateral detection rate of ICG technique. Conclusion: In early-stage cervical cancer, overall detection rate of SLN mapping is elevated while bilateral detection rate is lower. The overall detection rate (98%) as well as bilateral rate (85%) of ICG seems to be a better SLN mapping technique among the method of SLN mapping (using blue dye with Tc, Tc or ICG). We believe SLN mapping may be considered contemporary technique which could provide additional benefits over traditional pelvic lymphadenectomy. While promising results in SLN mapping has been found, larger patient samples, including randomized studies, are required at the same time.

TI  - Mapping dominant leaf type based on combined Sentinel-1/-2 data - Challenges for mountainous countries
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Countrywide winter and summer Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data, cloud-free summer Sentinel-2 (S2) images, an Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)-based Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and a forest mask were used to model and subsequently map Dominant Leaf Type (DLT) with the thematic classes broadleaved and coniferous trees for the whole of Switzerland. A novel workflow was developed that is robust, cost-efficient and highly automated using reference data from aerial image interpretation. Two machine learning approaches based on Random Forest (RF) and deep learning (UNET) for the whole country with three sets of predictor variables were applied. 24 subareas based on aspect and slope categories were applied to explore effects of the complex mountainous topography on model performances. The reference data split into training, validation and test data sets was spatially stratified using a 25 km regular grid. Model accuracies of both RF and UNET were generally highest with Kappa (K) around 0.95 when predictors were included from both S1/S2 and the topographic variables aspect, elevation and slope from the DTM. While only slightly lower accuracies were obtained when using S2 and DTM data, lowest accuracies were obtained when only predictors from S1 and DTM were included, with RF performing worse than UNET. While on countrywide level RF and UNET performed overall similarly, substantial differences in model performances, i.e. higher variances and lower accuracies, were found in subareas with northwest to northeast orientations. The combined use of S1/S2 and DTM predictors mitigated these problems related to topography and shadows and was therefore superior to the single use of S1 and DTM or S2 and DTM data. The comparison with independent National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data demonstrated precisions of K around 0.6 in the predictions of DLT and indicated a trend of increasing deviations in mixed forests. A comparison with the Copernicus High Resolution Layer (HRL) DLT 2018 revealed overall higher map accuracies with the exception of pure broadleaved forest. Although, spatial patterns of DTL were overall similar, UNET performed better than RF in areas with a distinct DLT on forest stand level, with the largest differences occurring when only S1 and DTM data was used. In contrast, predictions obtained from RF were more accurate in mixed stands. This study goes beyond the case study level and meets the requirements of countrywide data sets, in particular regarding repeatability, updating, costs and characteristics of training data sets. The 10 m countrywide DLT maps add complementary and spatially explicit information to the existing NFI estimates and are thus highly relevant for forestry practice and other related fields.

TI  - Exploring the coordination between physical space expansion and social space growth of China's urban agglomerations based on hierarchical analysis
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in China has led to weak internal coordination among demographic, economic, and social urbanization. Urban spatial expansion determines the urban pattern and is an important element of territorial spatial exploitation. Quantifying the coupling coordination relationship between socioeconomic growth and urban spatial expansion is needed. Using remote sensing data and socioeconomic statistics, we used the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) and an index system to quantify the spatiotemporal trend and coupling coordination relationship between urban spatial expansion (USE) and socioeconomic growth (SEG) for seven urban agglomerations from 2000 to 2015 at urban agglomeration scale and city scale respectively. The results showed that the three world-class urban agglomerations had the largest urban sprawl, along with the highest degrees of coupling coordination at the urban agglomeration scale. However, USE was slower than SEG in national-level urban agglomerations. At city scale, the provincial capitals and municipalities such as Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou and Changchun had higher coupling coordination degrees than the surrounding cities. The study also found that the coupling coordination degree of the Yangtze River Delta and Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration was higher than all the individual cities, indicating that the integration effect should be taken into consideration in urban agglomeration studies and collaborative development among cities was more conducive to the improvement of the overall coupling coordination degree of urban agglomerations. This study quantified the process of USE and SEG at two scales, identified their complicated coupling coordination relationship among the subsystems of urbanization in different periods, and provided specific policy-relevant suggestions, which will be helpful to the regional planning of China's urban agglomerations in future.

TI  - A prolonged and widespread thin mid-level liquid cloud layer as observed by ground-based lidars, radiosonde and space-borne instruments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A - 50-h-lasting mid-level thin liquid cloud layer was present over south and central China on December 13-15, 2018. Its characteristics were revealed by the observations from a polarization lidar and a water vapor Raman lidar at a mid-latitude site together with two geostationary satellites and the space-borne lidar CALIOP, as well as the conventional radiosondes. This layer was optically thick with cloud top at -3.5-km altitude and a thickness of -0.7 km. It resided on a warm-front-related inversion layer with the cloud top extending slightly above the inversion top and having a temperature of - - 4 to 1 degrees C. We found that the relative humidity over water peaked (-82-98%) near the liquid cloud center where the inversion layer had the temperature minima (-7 to -5 degrees C). This suggests that the moisture condensation into liquid droplets proceeded around the temperature minima of the inversion layer. The drizzle-sized water drop virga (no ice) occurred beneath the thin liquid cloud layer only during the first 7 h of its presence over our lidar site. The warm cloud top temperature (-3 degrees C) and strong wind shear at the cloud altitudes might be responsible for its formation. The Raman lidar observed a discernible increase in the subcloud water vapor mixing ratio due to the evaporation of the water drop virga. Satellite data revealed that the thin cloud layer covered a huge area over southern and central China. We found that its cloud top altitude increased overall with increasing latitude. This is consistent with the well-known warm-front cloud structure. It is shown through examining ECMWF reanalysis data that in the presence of the thin liquid cloud layer, a tropical cyclone located in the Bengal bay was uplifting continuously a large amount of moisture from the Indian Ocean. The resultant mid-level warm moist air masses were transported to China by the Indian monsoon, and then dispersed to the entire southern and central China under the influence of the southern branch of the Westerlies. Our findings provide a new insight into the formation and persistence of thin mid-level supercooled liquid cloud layers.

TI  - Genetic and immune characteristics of sentinel lymph node metastases and multiple lymph node metastases compared to their matched primary breast tumours
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients with breast cancer presenting with single lymph node metastasis (from a sentinel node) experience prolonged survival compared to patients with multiple lymph node metastases (>3). However, little information is available on the genetic and immunological characteristics of breast cancer metastases within the regional lymph nodes as they progress from the sentinel lymph node (SLN) downstream to multiple regional lymph nodes (MLNs). Methods: Genomic profiling was performed using a next-generation sequencing panel covering 520 cancerrelated genes in the primary tumour and metastatic lymph nodes of 157 female patients with breast cancer. We included primary tumours, metastatic lymph nodes and adjacent clinically normal lymph nodes (20 patients from the SLN group and 28 patients from the MLNs group) in the whole transcriptome analysis. Findings: The downstream metastatic lymph nodes (P = 0.029) and the primary breast tumours (P = 0.011) had a higher frequency of PIK3CA mutations compared to the SLN metastasis. We identified a distinct group of 14 mutations from single sentinel node metastasis and a different group of 15 mutations from multiple nodal metastases. Only 4 distinct mutations (PIK3CA, CDK4, NFKBIA and CDKN1B) were conserved in metastases from both lymph node settings. The tumour mutational burden (TMB) was significantly lower in single nodal metastasis compared to the paired primary breast cancer (P = 0.0021), while the decline in TMB did not reach statistical significance in the MLNs group (P = 0.083). In the gene set enrichment analysis, we identified 4 upregulated signatures in both primary tumour and nodal metastases from the MLNs group, including 3 Epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT) signatures and 1 angiogenesis signature. Both the CD8/Treg ratio and the CD8/EMT ratio were significantly higher in adjacent normal lymph nodes from patients with a single metastasis in the SLN compared with samples from the MLNs group (P = 0.045 and P = 0.023, respectively). This suggests that the immune defence from the MLNs patients might have a less favourable microenvironment, thus permitting multiple lymph nodes metastasis. Interpretation: Single lymph node metastases and multiple lymph node metastases have significant differences in their molecular profiles and immune profiles. The findings are associated with more aggressive tumour characteristics and less favourable immune charactoristics in patients with multiple nodal metastases compared to those with a single metastasis in the sentinel node.

TI  - A practical approach to reconstruct high-quality Landsat NDVI time-series data by gap filling and the Savitzky-Golay filter
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from Landsat satellites are important resources for vegetation monitoring. However, Landsat NDVI time-series data are usually temporally discontinuous owing to the nominal 16-day revisit cycle, frequent cloud contamination, and other factors. Although several methods have been proposed to reconstruct continuous Landsat NDVI time-series data, some challenges remain in the existing reconstruction methods. In this study, we developed a simple but effective Gap Filling and Savitzky-Golay filtering method (referred to as "GF-SG") to reconstruct high-quality Landsat NDVI time-series data. This new method first generates a synthesized NDVI time series by filling missing values in the original Landsat NDVI time-series data by integrating the MODIS NDVI time-series data and cloud-free Landsat observations. Then, a weighted Savitzky-Golay filter was designed to remove the residual noise in the synthesized time series. Compared with three previous typical methods (IFSDAF, STAIR, and Fill-and-Fit) in two challenging areas (the Coleambally irrigated area in Australia and the Taian cultivated area in China) with heterogeneous parcels and complex NDVI profiles, we found that GF-SG performed the best with three obvious improvements. First, GF-SG improved the reconstruction of long-term continuous missing values in Landsat NDVI time series, whereas the other methods were less reliable for reconstructing these long data gaps. Second, the performance of GF-SG was less affected by the residual noise caused by cloud detection errors in the Landsat image, which is due to the incorporation of the weighted SG filter in the new method. Third, GF-SG was simple and could be implemented on the computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is particularly important for the practical application of the new method at a large spatial scale.

TI  - Circulating microRNAs in Early Breast Cancer Patients and Its Association With Lymph Node Metastases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - MicroRNAs have emerged as important regulators of the metastatic process. In addition, circulating miRNAs appear to be surprisingly stable in peripheral blood making them ideal noninvasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Here, we performed a proof-of-principle study to investigate the expression profile of circulating miRNAs and their association with the metastatic lymph node status in early breast cancer patients. Sentinel lymph node status was detected by one-step nucleic acid (OSNA) analysis. We performed RNA-sequencing in 16 plasma samples and validated the results by qPCR. Gene Ontology term enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were carried out using DAVID tools. We found16 differentially expressed miRNAs (q < 0.01) in patients with positive SLNs. Fourteen miRNAs were down-regulated (miR-339-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-326, miR-331-3p, miR-369-3p, miR-328-3p, miR-26a-3p, miR-139-3p, miR-493-3p, miR-664a-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-323b-3p, miR-1307-3p and miR-423-3p) and 2 were up-regulated (miR-101-3pand miR-144-3p). Hierarchical clustering using differentially expressed miRNAs clearly distinguished patients according to their lymph node status. Gene ontology analysis showed a significant enrichment of biological processes associated with the regulation of the epithelial mesenchymal transition, cell proliferation and transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest the potential role of several circulating miRNAs as surrogate markers of lymph node metastases in early breast cancer patients. Further validation in a larger cohort of patients will be necessary to confirm our results.

TI  - Highly efficient production of bacterial cellulose from corn stover total hydrolysate by<i> Enterobacter</i> sp. FY-07
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) has a huge global market due to its excellent properties and wide range of applications. However, due to high production costs, low productivity, and unsatisfactory scale-up production, industrialisation has been slow. Herein, stabilization of strain, optimisation of culture conditions, and a cheap carbon source were combined to achieve highly efficient, low-cost, large-scale BC production in 20 L containers. Optimisation of culture conditions increased both BC productivity and sugar conversion ratio significantly, from 2.08 g/L/day and 9.78% to 17.13 g/L/day and 70.31%, respectively. Furthermore, BC productivity and sugar conversion ratio reached 13.96 g/L/day and 85.50% using corn stover total hydrolysate as carbon source. The low-cost, facile, and highly efficient process can generate large quantities of BC, and could promote industrialisation of BC production.

TI  - Oncologic outcomes of endometrial cancer in patients with low-volume metastasis in the sentinel lymph nodes: An international multi-institutional study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To assess oncologic outcomes in endometrial cancer patients with low-volume metastasis (LVM) in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Methods. Patients with endometrial cancer and SLN-LVM (<2 mm) from December 3, 2009, to December 31, 2018, were retrospectively identified from 22 centers worldwide. Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IV, adnexal involvement, or unknown adjuvant therapy (ATx) were excluded. Results. Of 247 patients included, 132 had isolated tumor cell (ITC) and 115 had micrometastasis (MM). Overall 4-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 77.6% (95% CI, 70.2%-85.9%); median follow-up for patients without recurrence was 29.6 (interquartile range, 19.2-41.5) months. At multivariate analysis, Non-endometrioid (NE) (HR, 5.00; 95% CI, 2.50-9.99; P < .001), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (HR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.45-7.31; P = .004), and uterine serosal invasion (USI) (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.44-9.54; P = .007) were independent predictors of recurrence. Among 47 endometrioid ITC patients without ATx, 4-year RFS was 82.6% (95% CI, 70.1%-97.2). Considering 18 ITC patients with endometrioid grade 1 disease, without LVSI, USI, or ATx, only 1 had recurrence (median follow-up, 24.8 months). Conclusions. In patients with SLN-LVM, NE, LVSI, and USI were independent risk factors for recurrence. Patients with any risk factor had poor prognosis, even when receiving ATx. Patients with ITC and grade 1 endometrioid disease (no LVSI/USI) had favorable prognosis, even without ATx. Further analysis (with more patients and longer follow-up) is needed to assess whether ATx can be withheld in this low-risk subgroup. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Picomets: Assessing single and few cell metastases in melanoma sentinel lymph node biopsies
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node involvement is a significant prognostic factor for melanoma. Both number of positive nodes and disease burden within a lymph node affects survival. However, the significance of few tumor cells within a single node and subsequent optimal management remains without consensus. We investigated the implications of minimal nodal disease on clinical outcomes.Methods: We reviewed 752 patients who underwent lymph node sampling at time of primary melanoma resection at our institution over 15 years. We deemed patients who had 1 node with 1 to 4 atypical cells staining positive for either Melan-A or Sox-10 as having "picomets." We examined the initial clinicopathological features, subsequent management, and outcomes.Results: Thirty-three patients (4%) met criteria for having picomets. The most common number of positively staining atypical cells was 1 (n 1/4 13). Nodal staging at initial pathology review varied, and overall stage ranged from IA to IIIC. Four patients underwent further therapy, none of whom had recurrent disease. Of the 29 patients undergoing observation/surveillance only, 5 had disease recurrence (17%).Conclusion: Although patients with picomets had better outcomes than historical stage matched cohorts, a small subset had recurrent disease. Staging patients with picomets as "N0" may not reflect the true negative prognostic significance of picomets. A larger population of patients meeting picomets criteria is needed to draw further conclusions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 diversity for flood inundation mapping using deep learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of flood water extent from satellite images has historically relied on either synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or multi-spectral (MS) imagery. MS sensors are limited to cloud free conditions, whereas SAR imagery is plagued by noise-like speckle. Prior studies that use combinations of MS and SAR data to overcome individual limitations of these sensors have not fully examined sensitivity of flood mapping performance to different combinations of SAR and MS derived spectral indices or band transformations in color space. This study explores the use of diverse bands of Sentinel 2 (S2) through well-established water indices and Sentinel 1 (S1) derived SAR imagery along with their combinations to assess their capability for generating accurate flood inundation maps. The robustness in performance of S-1 and S-2 band combinations was evaluated using 446 hand labeled flood inundation images spanning across 11 flood events from Sen1Floods11 dataset which are highly diverse in terms of land cover as well as location. A modified K-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of 32 combinations of S1 and S2 bands using a fully connected deep convolutional neural network known as U-Net. Our results indicated that usage of elevation information has improved the capability of S1 imagery to produce more accurate flood inundation maps. Compared to a median F1 score of 0.62 when using only S1 bands, the combined use of S1 and elevation information led to an improved median F1 score of 0.73. Water extraction indices based on S2 bands have a statistically significant superior performance in comparison to S1. Among all the band combinations, HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) transformation of S2 bands provides a median F1 score of 0.9, outperforming the commonly used water spectral indices owing to HSV's transformation's superior contrast distinguishing abilities. Additionally, U-Net algorithm was able to learn the relationship between raw S2 based water extraction indices and their corresponding raw S2 bands, but not of HSV owing to relatively complex computation involved in the latter. Results of the paper establishes important benchmarks for the extension of S1 and S2 data-based flood inundation mapping efforts over large spatial extents.

TI  - A global analysis of agricultural productivity and water resource consumption changes over cropland expansion regions
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland expansion often occurs on grasslands and partial forests. However, there is little quantified understanding of how cropland expansion affected the agricultural productivity and water resource consumption globally. In this study, we used spatially explicit satellite-based data, including land use maps, net primary productivity and evapotranspiration from 2001 to 2018, and the space-for-time substitution technique to investigate the relationships between cropland expansion and agricultural productivity and water resource consumption. Results showed that global cropland area presented a significant net increasing trend with 1.9 x 10(4) km(2)/a (p < 0.01) since 2000. Net increased cropland area over the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere occupied 27.1% and 72.9% of global total net increase, respectively. Large-area cropland expansion mainly focused on Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Eastern Europe, Southern America, and Northern America. Particularly, cropland expansion in the Southern America deserved the greatest attention. At the global scale, new expanded croplands caused average NPP decrease and average ET decrease compared to original ecosystems, but performances were evident differences in subregions. Cropland expansion in the Southern America evidently decreased NPP and ET compared to other places. In contrast, new expanded croplands in most subregions of Asia and Northern America performed higher the agriculture productivity, while the increases were done at the expense of more water resource consumption. Although cropland expansion only slightly decreased NPP compared to original ecosystems globally, new expanded croplands often occurred in water-limited or temperature-limited areas according to precipitation and temperature gradations. This study suggests that cropland expansion should more consider sustainable land use and development, and reduce the risks of cropland expansion on natural ecosystems as much as possible.

TI  - Remotely sensed applications in monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of pools and flows along non-perennial rivers: a review
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-perennial rivers (NPRs) account for more than 50% of the world's river network and their occurrence is expanding. Some rivers that were previously classified as perennial have evolved to be NPRs in response to climate change and socio-economic uses. There is inadequate understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of flows and pools along these rivers due to lack of data, as a priority of river monitoring has been placed on perennial rivers. The current understanding and methods used for monitoring NPRs are mostly derived from perennial rivers perspective. This review paper examines challenges for collecting data on these hydrological attributes of NPRs using current methods. Furthermore, this paper provides an overview of the potential and limitations of using remote sensing data for monitoring NPRs. Remote sensing data are successfully used for monitoring wetlands and lakes, but little is known about their capabilities for monitoring pools along NPRs. Remote sensing has also been successfully used to estimate discharge of large perennial rivers; however, this has not been fully explored for NPRs. Remote sensing has the potential to extract more hydrological information that currently cannot be extracted using conventional in-situ measurement methods. With advancements, remote sensing technology could become useful for managing NPRs.

TI  - The Irish Atlantic CoCliME case study configuration, validation and application of a downscaled ROMS ocean climate model off SW Ireland
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This ocean numerical modelling study is focused on the shelf waters off southwest Ireland. Outputs from the model are used to provide scientists and policy makers with climate change information related to oceanic conditions that influence harmful algal blooms in the region. Four simulations were developed to include a 20year hindcast simulation (1997-2016), a 31-year historical simulation (1975-2005), and two 30-year future climate model projections (2006-2035) for the representative carbon pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We evaluated the hindcast model skill by comparing the simulation outputs with measured observational data and calculated statistics such as the bias, and the root mean square error (RMSE). The observations consisted of satellite sea surface temperature and, CTD temperature and salinity profile data collected in Irish waters. The sea surface temperature RMSEs between the 20-year hindcast simulation and the satellite data were ca. 0.50 degrees C. A minimum RMSE of ca. 0.20 degrees C was recorded in December 2015. The basin-averaged bias (difference) and RMSE for near bottom temperature between the RCP 4.5 and the historical simulation was 0.14 degrees C and 0.27 degrees C respectively. The sea surface temperature anomaly pattern for the RCP 8.5 shows warming across the whole model domain. The sea surface salinity and near bottom salinity climate simulation anomaly maps indicate a general freshening on the southwest Irish shelf. A change of ca. 0.2 sea surface salinity and near bottom salinity was observed. The RCP 8.5 simulation shows the highest current velocities when compared to other simulations. The Irish coastal current pattern under the RCP 8.5 scenario appears very intense and well defined with a velocity > 20 [cm/s].

TI  - The QAA-RGB: A universal three-band absorption and backscattering retrieval algorithm for high resolution satellite sensors. Development and implementation in ACOLITE
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the "QAA-RGB", a semianalytical algorithm that retrieves total absorption, particle backscattering, as well as the diffuse attenuation coefficient and the Secchi disk depth, from eighteen metre and decametre satellite sensors, including present and heritage Landsat's data, Sentinel 2 at 10 m and an array of commercial satellites such as PlanetScope, Pleiades and Worldview. The QAA-RGB is a minimal version of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA), and therefore keeps its robustness and general validity across different water types. It ingests remote-sensing reflectance at only three bands, centred on red, green and blue wavelengths. Retrievals of non-water absorption at 555 nm (a(nw)(555)) are satisfactory, with a standard deviation of sigma similar to 50% up to a(nw)(555) < 2 m(-1), based on in situ datasets. Careful calibration results in unbiased retrievals across all sensors. Validation to independent in situ data is also provided. The QAA-RGB has been implemented in the ACOLITE generic processor, and is openly accessible to the community. Consistency of near-coincident observations from different satellite sensors is demonstrated.

TI  - A PLSR model to predict soil salinity using Sentinel-2 MSI data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization is one of the most widespread environmental threats in arid and semi-arid regions that occur either naturally or artificially within the soil. When exceeding the thresholds, salinity becomes a severe danger, damaging agricultural production, water and soil quality, biodiversity, and infrastructures. This study used spectral indices, including salinity and vegetation indices, Sentinel-2 MSI original bands, and DEM, to model soil salinity in the Great Hungarian Plain. Eighty-one soil samples in the upper 30 cm of the soil surface were collected from vegetated and nonvegetated areas by the Research Institute for Soil Sciences and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC). The sampling campaign of salinity monitoring was performed in the dry season to enhance salt spectral characteristics during its accumulation in the subsoil. Hence, applying a partial least squares regression (PLSR) between salt content (g/kg) and remotely sensed data manifested a highly moderate correlation with a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.68, a p-value of 0.000017, and a root mean square error of 0.22. The final model can be deployed to highlight soil salinity levels in the study area and assist in understanding the efficacy of land management strategies.

TI  - Evaluation of Absolute Maximum Urban Heat Island Intensity Based on a Simplified Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon can be harmful during the summer season jeopardizing the safety of some vulnerable population classes. Typically, the study of the UHI requires long data acquisitions using weather stations widely distributed within the cities. To this aim, recent research proposed multicriteria approaches aimed at quantifying the hazard of the summer absolute maximum Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII), in urban districts. On the contrary, these approaches are time consuming and involve a large number of parameters. This article proposes a simplified multiparametric approach based on the three principal parameters involved in the UHI (albedo, greenery, and anthropogenic heat) obtained by a refined remote sensing data acquisition. In comparison with other approaches, the proposed method is simpler and quick to apply while maintaining good precision. Moreover, a calibration is achieved by exploiting the real absolute max UHII of a set of 41 European urban districts and a validation is obtained by a comparison with another multiparametric approach already validated in literature. Both the approaches are applied to 96 urban districts of Berlin. The results show that the simplified procedure keep an average error less than 1 degrees C but improving in applicability.

TI  - The Utility of Simpler Spatial Disaggregation Models for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature at High Spatiotemporal Resolutions
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared (TIR) sensors aboard geostationary satellites provide multi-temporal land surface temperature (LST) observations for characterizing the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) at a coarse spatial resolution. This study aims to test if simpler spatial disaggregation models developed to improve the spatial resolution of LST data can be applied across the temporal domain to obtain LST at relatively higher spatial resolution and to capture the DTC. LST from geostationary satellites Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3D were downscaled from 8- and 5-km spatial resolutions respectively to 1 km resolution using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired during its daytime overpass. Two disaggregation models, DisTrad and NL-DisTrad and a data fusion model spatiotemporal integrated fusion model (STITFM) were selected for the purpose. The downscaled LSTs were compared against the MODIS LST observations from Terra nighttime and Aqua daytime overpasses in addition to in situ data at four sites in India. The results indicated that the DisTrad model (RMSE: 3.61 K, R-2: 0.95) was able to capture the spatiotemporal patterns with an accuracy comparable to that of the STITFM model (RMSE: 3.22 K, R-2: 0.96). However, the NL-DisTrad performed inconsistently, leading to higher errors.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for energy is increasing day by day worldwide due to population growth, industrialization and rising living standards. Geothermal energy, one of the alternative energy sources, is preferred in terms of providing environmentally friendly, quality and regular energy. Our country is rich in geothermal resource potential. However, there are still many unexplored geothermal resources. In this study, fuzzy-AHP method was used to determine the geothermal potential of Agri province. Five criteria such as geological formations, hot / mineral springs, lineaments, land surface temperature and hydrothermal alteration zones were evaluated to determine the having geothermal potential. The maps of lineament, land surface temperature and hydrothermal alteration zones were prepared using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images. Each criterion was weighted with the fuzzy-AHP method, analyzed in the GIS environment, and the geothermal potential index (GPI) of the study area was calculated. As a result, areas with very high, high, medium and low geothermal potential were determined in the study area. According to the GPI map of the study area, Agri provincial center, Patnos, Eleskirt, and Dogubayazit regions have high geothermal potential. In addition, the known geothermal fields in the study area have been identified as areas with very high geothermal potential. These data reveal the accuracy of the study and used method.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in early-stage cervical cancer - A national prospective multicenter study (SENTIREC trial)
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping may replace staging radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer. In a national multicenter setting, we evaluated SLN mapping in women with early-stage cervical cancer and investigated the accuracy of SLN mapping and FDG-PET/CT in tumors >20 mm. Methods. We prospectively included women with early-stage cervical cancer from March 2017-January 2021 to undergo SLN mapping. Women with tumors >20 mm underwent completion pelvic lymphadenectomy and removal of FDG-PET/CT positive nodes. We determined SLN detection rates, incidence of nodal disease, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLN mapping, and the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value (PPV) of FDG-PET/CT. Results. We included 245 women, and 38 (15.5%) had nodal metastasis. The SLN detection rate was 96.3% (236/245), with 82.0% (201/245) bilateral detection. In a stratified analysis of 103 women with tumors >20 mm, 27 (26.2%) had nodal metastases. The sensitivity of SLN mapping adhering to the algorithm was 96.3% (95% CI 81.0-99.9%) and the NPV 98.7% (95% CI 93.0-100%). For FDG-PET/CT imaging the sensitivity was 14.8% (95% CI 4.2-33.7%), the specificity 85.5% (95% CI 75.6-92.5%), the NPV 73.9% (95% CI 63.4-82.7%), and the PPV 26.7% (95% CI 7.8-55.1%). Conclusions. SLN mapping seems to be an adequate staging procedure in early-stage cervical cancer tumors <= 20 mm. In tumors >20 mm, SLN mapping is highly sensitive but demands full adherence to the SLN algorithm. We recommend completion pelvic lymphadenectomy in tumors >20 mm until the oncological safety is established. FDG-PET/CT for nodal staging of women with early-stage cervical cancer seems limited.

TI  - Lymph node assessment at the time of hysterectomy has limited clinical utility for patients with pre-cancerous endometrial lesions
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with a pre-invasive endometrial lesion who meet Mayo criteria for lymph node dissection on final pathology to determine if the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with pre-invasive lesions would be warranted. Methods. All women who underwent hysterectomy for a pre-invasive endometrial lesion (atypical hyperplasia or endometrial intra-epithelial neoplasia) between 2009 and 2019 were included for analysis. Relevant statistical tests were utilized to test the associations between patient, operative, and pathologic characteristics. Results. 141 patients met inclusion criteria. 51 patients (36%) had a final diagnosis of cancer, the majority (96%) of which were Stage IA grade 1 endometrioid carcinomas. Seven patients (5%) met Mayo criteria on final pathology (one grade 3, seven size >2 cm, one >50% myoinvasive). Three of these seven patients had lymph nodes assessed of which 0% had metastases. Six of these patients had frozen section performed, and 2 met (33%) Mayo criteria intraoperatively. Of the seven patients in the overall cohort that had lymph node sampling, six had a final diagnosis of cancer and none had positive lymph nodes. Of the 51 patients with cancer, only 10 had cancer diagnosed using frozen section, and only two met intra-operative Mayo criteria. Age > 55 was predictive of meeting Mayo criteria on final pathology (p = 0.007). No patients experienced a cancer recurrence across a median follow up of 24.3 months. Conclusions. Atypical hyperplasia and endometrial intra-epithelial neoplasia portend low risk disease and universal nodal assessment is of limited value. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selecting features for LULC simultaneous classification of ambiguous classes by artificial neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The anthropic activities carried out in the vicinity of the water body trigger various harmful effects on flora, fauna, and human health. The release of effluents and nutrients renders the aquatic environment increasingly eutrophic, favoring the proliferation of macrophytes, leading to loss of biodiversity, in addition to degradation of water quality. Since land use and land cover (LULC) around water bodies strongly influence macrophyte proliferation, it is necessary to simultaneously monitor the water body and its surroundings to manage and control the overabundance of aquatic vegetation. Due to the spectral similarity between aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, it is a challenge to simultaneously monitor these targets, especially when macrophyte mapping is placed within the context of LULC mapping. The inclusion of auxiliary data that promotes an increase the aquatic vegetation discrimination can even improve the accuracy of a LULC mapping. However, an excessive number of features can increase the complexity and reduce the mapping accuracy. We assume that it is necessary to select a set of suitable features, including spectral and textural data extracted from multispectral images, in addition to a DEM, allows the macrophytes discrimination in a water body and increases the classification accuracy in a simultaneous mapping of LULC classes, but only with the addition of a DEM, there is better discrimination of aquatic macrophytes in a simultaneous mapping of LULC classes. To achieve this, four feature selection methods (Correlation, Gain Ratio, Relief, and out-of-bag Random Forest) were applied to define the best subsets for a LULC mapping that integrates the water body with the watershed landscape. The various subsets of selected features were classified using a supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. The results show that features derived from OLI/Landsat 8 combined with DEM data provided an effective contribution to increase the accuracy classification and reduce confusion between aquatic and terrestrial vegetation. The best kappa coefficient was obtained from the Correlation features set, achieving a 10% improvement after the inclusion of DEM. Thus, the results of this study showed that the DEM inclusion can improve the aquatic vegetation discrimination in LULC classifications, even when different feature selection methods do not indicate that variable as relevant to machine learning-based classification.

Knowledge of current diagnostic practices and the coverage of the national Salmonella surveillance system are important to correctly interpret surveillance data and trends over time, to estimate the true burden of salmonellosis in Belgium, and to evaluate the appropriateness of implementing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at this central level.Methods The coverage of the NRC was defined as the proportion of all diagnosed human Salmonella cases in Belgium reported to the NRC and was assessed for 2019 via a survey among all licensed Belgian medical laboratories in 2019, and for 2016-2020 via a capture-recapture study using the Sentinel Network of Laboratories (SNL) as the external source. In addition, the survey was used to assess the impact of the implementation of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) at the level of peripheral laboratory sites, as a potential threat to national public health surveillance programs.Results The coverage of the NRC surveillance system was estimated to be 83% and 85%, based on the results of the survey and on the two-source capture-recapture study, respectively. Further, the results of the survey indicated a limited use of CIDTs by peripheral laboratories in 2019.Conclusion Given the high coverage and the limited impact of CIDTs on the referral of isolates, we may conclude that the NRC can confidently monitor the epidemiological situation and identify outbreaks throughout the country. These findings may guide the decision to implement WGS at the level of the NRC and may improve estimates of the true burden of salmonellosis in Belgium.

TI  - Diffraction of irregular ocean waves measured by altimeter in the lee of islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of diffraction of irregular ocean waves, there is a lack of reported measurements over scales larger than a few tens of wavelengths. In the coastal zone, Satellite Altimetry is hindered because the backscatter characteristics of waveforms deviate from Brown's theoretical model, specially up to 20 km from the coastline. Here, we combine a novel set of retracked - reprocessed - altimeter data with directional buoy spectra and simulations with a spectral numerical model where diffraction is computed with an approximation based on the Mild Slope Equation. The Channel Islands, off the coast of California, is an ideal spot for the analysis because of the sharp variations in bathymetry in the vicinity of the archipelago, increasing the relative importance of diffraction over refraction. Spatial variations of wave energy in the lee of the islands are investigated along and across the wave propagation direction. For the first time the lateral rate of energy spreading - across the wave propagation direction - was computed in oceanic conditions and are of the same magnitude as those found in previously published experiments in a wave tank. The importance of diffraction as a non-dissipative process during wave propagation in situations normally encountered in the ocean is also discussed.

TI  - Can assimilation of satellite observations improve subsurface biological properties in a numerical model? A case study for the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given current threats to ocean ecosystem health, there is a growing demand for accurate biogeochemical hindcasts, nowcasts, and predictions. Provision of such products requires data assimilation, i.e., a comprehensive strategy for incorporating observations into biogeochemical models, but current data streams of biogeochemical observations are generally considered insufficient for the operational provision of such products. This study investigates to what degree the assimilation of satellite observations in combination with a priori model calibration by sparse BGC-Argo profiles can improve subsurface biogeochemical properties. The multivariate deterministic ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF) has been implemented to assimilate physical and biological observations into a three-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model, the biogeochemical component of which has been calibrated by BGC-Argo float data for the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, observations of sea surface height, sea surface temperature, and surface chlorophyll were assimilated, and profiles of both physical and biological variables were updated based on the surface information. We assessed whether this leads to improved subsurface distributions, especially of biological properties, using observations from five BGC-Argo floats that were not assimilated. An alternative light parameterization that was tuned a priori using BGC-Argo observations was also applied to test the sensitivity of data assimilation impact on subsurface biological properties. Results show that assimilation of the satellite data improves model representation of major circulation features, which translate into improved three-dimensional distributions of temperature and salinity. The multivariate assimilation also improves the agreement of subsurface nitrate through its tight correlation with temperature, but the improvements in subsurface chlorophyll were modest initially due to suboptimal choices of the model's optical module. Repeating the assimilation run by using the alternative light parameterization greatly improved the subsurface distribution of chlorophyll. Therefore, even sparse BGC-Argo observations can provide substantial benefits for biogeochemical prediction by enabling a priori model tuning. Given that, so far, the abundance of BGC-Argo profiles in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere has been insufficient for sequential assimilation, updating 3D biological properties in a model that has been well calibrated is an intermediate step toward full assimilation of the new data types.

TI  - A method for land surface temperature retrieval based on model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most algorithms for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval depend on acquiring prior knowledge. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel LST retrieval method based on model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning, called the MDK-DL method. Based on the expert knowledge and radiation transfer model, we deduce LST retrieval mechanism and determine the best combination of the thermal infrared (TIR) bands of the sensor. Then, we use the radiation transfer model simulation and reliable satellite-ground data to establish a training and test database, and finally use the deep learning neural network for optimal computation. Three typical high-, medium- and low-spatial-resolution TIR remote sensing datasets (from Gaofen, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Fengyun) are used for theoretical simulation and application analysis. The simulation shows that the minimum mean absolute error (MAE) is less than 0.1 K (standard deviation: 0.04 K; correlation coefficient: 1.000) at a small viewing direction (<7.5 degrees) and less than 0.8 K at a large viewing direction (<65 degrees). The in situ validation shows that the minimum MAE obtained by the optimal band combination is approximately 1 K (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.12 K; coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.902). The retrieval accuracy is improved by increasing the number of TIR bands in the atmospheric window, and adding accurate atmospheric water vapor information produces better results. In general, four TIR bands in the atmospheric window bands are sufficient to retrieve the LST with high accuracy. Likewise, three TIR bands plus atmospheric water vapor information are sufficient for the retrieval requirements. All analyses indicate that our method is feasible and reliably accurate and can also be used to help design the instrument band to retrieve the LST with high precision.

TI  - Role of inflammation in depression and anxiety: Tests for disorder specificity, linearity and potential causality of association in the UK Biobank
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and other inflammatory markers are elevated in people with depression and anxiety compared to controls, but evidence for disorder-specificity, linearity and potential causality is sparse.Methods: Using population-based data from up to 144,890 UK Biobank cohort participants, we tested associations of circulating CRP concentrations with depression and anxiety symptom scores and probable diagnosis, including tests for linearity, disorder-specificity and sex difference. We examined potential causality using 1-sample and 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses testing associations of genetically-predicted CRP concentration and IL-6 activity with depression and anxiety. The study was conducted from June 2019 to February 2021.Findings: CRP concentration was associated with depressive and anxiety symptom scores and with probable diagnoses of depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in a dose-response fashion. These associations were stronger for depression than for anxiety, and for women than for men although less consistently. MR analyses provided consistent results suggesting that genetically predicted higher IL-6 activity was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms, while genetically-predicted higher CRP concentration was associated with decreased risks of depressive and anxiety symptoms.Interpretation: Altered activity of the IL-6/IL-6R pathway could be a risk factor for depression. The field now requires experimental studies of IL-6 modulation in humans and animal models to further examine causality, mechanisms and treatment potential. Such studies are also needed to elucidate mechanisms for divergent associations of genetically-predicted higher IL-6 activity (risk increasing) and higher CRP concentrations (protective) with depression/anxiety.

TI  - <i>Dirofilaria immitis</i> and Dirofilaria repens in mosquitoes from Corsica Island, France
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are the main causative agents of heartworm disease and subcutaneous dirofilariasis in domestic and wild canids, respectively. Both pathogens have zoonotic potential and are transmitted by mosquitoes. The present study aimed to determine the transmission period, prevalence and diversity of Dirofilaria spp. vectors from endemic areas of Corsica (France).Methods: A monthly point data model based on average temperature recorded by four meteorological stations during 2017 was used to calculate the Dirofilaria transmission period. From June to September 2017, female mosquitoes (n = 1802) were captured using-Biogents (R) Sentinel 2 traps lured with carbon dioxide and BG-LureT or octanol. Mosquitoes were identified to species level, pooled accordingly, and screened using multiplex real-time qPCR to detect D. immitis and D. repens.Results: The monthly point data model showed the possible transmission of Dirofilaria spp. from the third week in May to the last week in October in the studied area. Mosquitoes were identified as Ochlerotatus caspius (n = 1432), Aedes albopictus (n = 199), Culex pipiens sensu lato (n = 165) and Aedes vexans (n = 6) and were grouped into 109 pools (from 1 to 27 specimens, mean 11.4 +/- 0.7), of which 16 scored positive for Dirofilaria spp. (i.e., n = 13; estimated infection rate [EIR] = 1.1% for D. immitis and n = 3; EIR = 0.2% for D. repens). Specifically, 6 (i.e., EIR = 3.8%) of 15 pools of Ae. albopictus were positive for D. immitis, 2 of 14 of Cx. pipiens s.l. were positive for D. immitis and D. repens, respectively, and 8 of 77 pools of Oc. caspius were positive for D. immitis (i.e., n = 6; EIR = 0.4%) and D. repens (i.e., 2; EIR = 0.1%). The highest mosquito infection rate was recorded in July (EIR = 2.5%), then in June (EIR = 1.3%) and September (EIR = 0.6%).Conclusions: The data suggest that both Dirofilaria species are endemic and occur possibly in sympatry in the studied area in Corsica, highlighting the need to implement preventive chemoprophylaxis and vector control strategies to reduce the risk of these filarioids in dog and human populations.

TI  - Improving object-oriented land use/cover classification from high resolution imagery by spectral similarity-based post-classification
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To classify an image, traditional classifiers depend mainly on the spectral and/or textural distinctions between different land-cover units, while this study attempts to explore the properties of statistical distinction. Using the historical classification results, we present a novel algorithm for imagery classification that achieves high accuracy, automation and efficiency. Based on object-oriented image analysis, it exploits the advantages of d(ch) (the Chaudhuri's metric) using a multi-step approach, and the objective is not to reclassify an image, but to refine or update the existing land-use/-cover classification results by comparing the pairwise d(ch) value (namely similarity) between different image segments. Finally, the similar/homogeneous segments will be confirmed as their original class labels, while the inhomogeneous/dissimilar segments will be masked out with an appropriate threshold on the similarity image and be relabelled. We have systematically evaluated the algorithm by running it on the basis of the existing GIS base maps, which indicated the good performance of it.

TI  - Deriving exclusion maps from C-band SAR time-series in support of floodwater mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) intensity is used as an input to many flood-mapping algorithms. The appearance of floodwater tends to cause a substantial decrease of backscatter intensity over scarcely vegetated terrain. However, limitations exist in areas where the SAR backscatter is not sufficiently sensitive to surface changes, e.g. shadow areas due to topography or obstacles on the ground, densely forested areas, sand, etc. Thus, we argue that it is of paramount importance to complement any SAR-based flood extent map with an exclusion map (EXmap) indicating all areas where the presence of water cannot be derived from SAR intensity observations. In this study, we introduce a methodology for generating an EX-map based on the analysis of time-series of SAR backscatter data. In particular, the identification of the EX-map is based on the combined use of three temporal indicators based on backscatter statistics, i.e. temporal median, minimum and standard deviation. As a test case, EX-maps were derived from Sentinel-1 data acquired during the 2014-2019 time period from six representative study sites. Reference maps were generated using a global land cover map, Digital Elevation Model (DEM)derived shadow/layover masks, global urban footprint (GUF) data and a Sand Exclusion Layer (SEL). The crosscomparison revealed that the EX-map was consistent with reference maps obtained from other data sources.

TI  - Analysis of planform changes of the lower reach of Gilgel Abay River Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia, using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluvial planform change is the process of formation and development of new features or reshaping of existed features by the flowing water in the river system. This study aimed to identify, quantify, and map the lower reach of Gilgel Abay River reach 56 km from the mouth of the river into Lake Tana, planform change over three decades. GIS and recent advanced remote sensing have been used to identify, quantify, and map planform changes with the integration of serious field observation. Topographic map, latest Landsat images, and recent Spot images of 2016 (1.5 x 1.5 m spatial resolution) were used to delineate planform change features of study reach over the last 35 years. From the natural river process, the erosion and deposition of sediment on both banks of a river result in the continuous expansion of river width and area. The study reach undergoes different planform changes. The amount and rate of river bank migration, length, valley length, sinuosity, width, lateral migration, and lake shoreline variation around the mouth of the river into Lake Tata from 1984 to 2019 were the major planform changes identified, quantified, and mapped. The main planform change around the mouth of the river was bifurcating the channel 5 km upstream of the current mouth of the river. The study reach sinuosity was laid under low sinuous channel category with sinuosity between 1 and 1.32 and it shows the general decrease of sinuosity by -4.31%. The lower reach of the river needs planning and management policy to minimize river planform change including channel shifting, delta and island expansion and alteration, and its effect on lake level and surrounding ecosystem imbalance.

TI  - Desmoplastic Neurotropic Melanoma Presenting as Pilonidal Sinus: A Rare Clinical Association
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Rare coexistence of disease or pathologyBackground: Pilonidal Sinus (PNS) is a small cutaneous orifice in the intergluteal region; symptoms include pain and swelling. Disparately, desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma (DNM) accounts for 1% of all melanomas and mostly occurs in the head and neck region. Because its appearance is generally benign, it typically comes to surgical attention only at an advanced stage or after recurrence. A perineural involvement occurs in 30-40% of the cases and is accompanied by symptoms such as paresthesia, paresis, and/or paralysis. To the best of our knowledge, the association between PNS and DNM has not been described in the literature before. Here, we present a patient with PNS that was diagnosed with DNM.Case Report: A 31-year-old healthy man presented with coccydynia and sacral cyst that had been present for about a year. While the initial diagnosis was of a PNS, after excision and biopsy, the pathology changed to PNS with DNM. The patient underwent a work-up for distant metastasis, which was negative. Wide local excision (WLE) with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was also performed.Conclusions: Due to the malignant potential of PNS, we support the routine of pathological examination of excised specimens. Once DNM is diagnosed, work-up for distant metastasis and further treatment with WLE as well as SLNB are recommended. The current report describes an association between PNS and DNM. While coccydynia may have been caused by the PNS or the melanoma, the presence of the PNS helped with an earlier diagnosis of the melanoma. Further research on the possible causative relationship between the conditions is required.

TI  - Colored dissolved organic matter absorption at global scale from ocean color radiometry observation: Spatio-temporal variability and contribution to the absorption budget
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi-analytical model (CDOM-KD2) based on the light vertical attenuation coefficient (K-d(lambda)) has been developed for estimating the absorption by colored dissolved organic matter, a(cdom)(443), from ocean color remote sensing at global scale. The performance of this new inversion model together with that of former models by Shanmugam (2011) (S2011), Chen et al. (2017) (C2017) and Aurin et al. (2018) (A2018) was evaluated from in situ and matchup validation data sets gathering worldwide distributed samples. An overall consistency in the a(cdom)(443) estimated from S2011, C2017 and CDOM-KD2 models with a slightly better performance of the latter method was observed (MAPD of 27.42% and 30.85% for open ocean with in situ and satellite data, respectively), emphasizing the possible specific assessment of a(cdom)(443) dynamics from satellite remote sensing over the global ocean including the most oligotrophic waters. At 443 nm the global average relative contribution of a(cdom)(443) to the absorption by colored detrital matter, a(cdm)(443) is of 61% +/- 14%, while the contribution of a(cdom)(443) to the non-water absorption, anw(443), is of 35% +/- 26%. Strong spatial disparities are however observed for both a(cdom)(443) temporal dynamics and relative contribution in the absorption budget. A decoupling is observed between acdom(443) and particulate detrital (i.e. non-living) matter and phytoplankton in the gyre areas where a low temporal variability is globally observed. This is contrasting with water masses influenced by terrestrial inputs as well as in equatorial and subtropical areas impacted by main oceanic currents where CDOM loads and a(cdom)(443) contribution in the water absorption budget are more variable.

TI  - Investigating the present status, spatial change, and emerging issues related to riparian wetlands of Bhagirathi-Jalangi Floodplain (BJF) in lower deltaic West Bengal, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain wetlands have considerable ecological and economic significance. The study area, consisting of the Bhagirathi-Jalangi Floodplain (BJF), is endowed with numerous wetlands. Based on the tentative time of origin and wetland index map, the investigation selects eight major riparian wetlands and their surroundings from the meander belt of the rivers Bhagirathi and Jalangi. The study primarily emphasizes on periodic mapping for areal change detection and identification of emerging issues between 1955 and 2018. The data used for the present research includes Topographical maps, Landsat imagery, Google maps, Sentinel 2B imagery of different time periods and some ancient maps which depict the old courses of river Bhagirathi and Jalangi. By using geospatial techniques and field investigation, the study reveals that from 1955 to 2018, wetlands have been shrinking rapidly. It is found from the investigation that total wetland area has reduced by about 39.60% due to land reclamation and wetland transformation. The land use change detection depicts that agricultural expansion, which has increased up to 35%, is the dominant control factor for wetland decay. More than 87% of the selected wetlands have experienced area loss. Among the selected wetlands, 25% have lost more than 90% of their areal extent during the stipulated study period. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) are the two indices used for measuring the concentration of aquatic plants. Geospatial analysis suggests that the NDVI value is higher in pre-monsoon season in comparison with post-monsoon. High NDVI value which is >= 0.51 covers more than 81% of the wetland surface area. In contrast, low NDWI value (<= 0.20), covering more than 60% of the wetland surface area, is found in 75% of the selected wetlands. The study finally concludes that due to accelerated anthropogenic intervention floodplain wetlands in the BJF require special attention to ensure future sustainability.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - More severe drought detected by the assimilation of brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies in Texas during 2010-2013
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Texas experienced an extreme drought on record in 2011. Model simulations or satellite observations have been used to assess and analyze the drought. In this study, a method based on multi-source remote sensing data assimilation is proposed to evaluate the drought in Texas, which combines the advantages of model simulations and satellite observations. Brightness temperature from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS/Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-E/AMSR2) and terrestrial water storage anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) are assimilated into the Noah-Multiparameterization model (Noah-MP) to improve the soil moisture and drought estimation. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) was used as a data assimilation method with observation aggregation (dealing with the multi-resolution observations) and observation bias correction (dealing with the systematic bias between observations and simulations). Data from ground stations and satellites are used for the validation of soil moisture, terrestrial water storage anomalies, and evapotranspiration. With assimilation, slight improvement can be found for surface soil moisture over the open-loop configuration, but some notable degradations are also observed. More obvious improvement can be found at deep layers, which is mainly due to the assimilation of terrestrial water storage anomalies. In addition, the improvement for terrestrial water storage anomalies and evapotranspiration is more statistically significant in most regions of Texas. Overall, the assimilation experiment plays a positive role in the estimation of essential variables relate to drought. The drought is estimated using the soil moisture percentile and classified into five categories. The results from the assimilation experiment tend to predict a more severe drought in Texas for both magnitude and spatial patterns, which indicates not only the well-known drought in 2011 but also the continuous severe drought in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, the spatial distribution of drought reveals that drought occurred more frequently in the North, West, and Southwest.

TI  - Ecological consequences of Australia's "Black Summer" bushfires: Managing for recovery
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has long been a part of the Australian environment and remains a potent force in shaping the adaptations of species, the dynamics of populations, and the structure of ecological communities. However, the fire regime is changing. Fire seasons are longer, wet vegetation types that do not usually burn are now at risk, and fire intensity and severity are greater than in the recent past. A particularly widespread event occurred in the forest and woodland regions of Australia over the summer of 2019-2020. Termed the "Black Summer" bushfires, remotely sensed data indicate that over 30 million hectares of vegetation were burned, including an unprecedented large area of forest. The extraordinary geographical scale of the Black Summer fires, including the intensity and speed of fire spread, has led to widespread concern about the ecological damage that occurred. Recent estimates suggest that almost three billion vertebrates and up to 240 trillion invertebrates were affected by the fires. Fires were experienced in part of the geographical ranges of 832 vertebrate species and 37 threatened ecological communities, with some of these entities feared to be at risk of extinction. Field assessments of ecological recovery have been slowed by COVID-19 restrictions and by a diminution in ecological monitoring capacity that occurred before the last fire season. This paper assesses the dire ecological consequences of the Black Summer bushfires and proposes a series of steps to help achieve recovery of biodiversity and mitigate the effects of future mega-fires.

TI  - Strategies for treatment of oral cavity cancer
T2  - MKG-CHIRURG
M3  - Article
AB  - In principle, primary surgical and non-surgical therapeutic strategies are available for curative treatment of oral cavity cancer. In early stages, surgery alone is first-line treatment and provides the most favorable oncologic outcomes based on current data. Definitive radiotherapy is an alternative, especially for patients who refuse surgery or in case of inoperability for medical reasons or synchronous multiple cancers. Brachytherapy avoids irradiation of surrounding tissues, but has limitations due to the purely local effect. The standard for advanced stages is primary resection followed by radiotherapy or chemoradiation with cisplatin, depending on risk. Although there are no directly comparative studies available, there is increasing evidence that the primary surgical approach is superior to the nonsurgical approach for locoregionally limited oral cavity cancer. This is in contrast to other tumor entities in the head and neck region and only true as long as the preconditions for such an approach are met. For advanced oral cavity cancers that are inoperable or not operable in a reasonable manner, whether for medical reasons, functional concerns, or due to refusal of surgery, simultaneous chemoradiation with high-dose cisplatin is the standard. In the recurrence situation, therapeutic strategies must always be individually weighed up and tailored.

TI  - The 150th anniversary of <i>The Descent of Man</i>: Darwin and the impact of sex-role reversal on sexual selection research
T2  - BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - The year 2021 marks the 150(th) anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's extraordinary book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. Here, we review the history and impact of a single profound insight from The Descent of Man: that, in some few species, females rather than males compete for access to mates. In other words, these species are 'sex-role reversed' with respect to mating competition and sexual selection compared to the majority of species in which sexual selection acts most strongly on males. Over the subsequent 150 years, sex-role-reversed species have motivated multiple key conceptual breakthroughs in sexual selection. The surprising mating dynamics of such species challenged scientists' preconceptions, forcing them to examine implicit assumptions and stereotypes. This wider worldview has led to a richer and more nuanced understanding of animal mating systems and, in particular, to a proper appreciation for the fundamental role that females play in shaping these systems. Sex-role-reversed species have considerable untapped potential and will continue to contribute to sexual selection research in the decades to come.

TI  - Modelling of volcanic ash with HYSPLIT and satellite observations: a case study of the 2018 Barren Island volcano eruption event, Andaman Territory, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to identify, characterize monitor and model the transport pathways of volcanic ashes and various features of the active phase of Barren Island volcano (BIV), Andaman and Nicobar Island, India during 2018 using the several Earth observation satellite technologies and field observations in the study area. Sentinel-2 satellite datasets have been used to identify volcanic eruption features such as lava flow, ash plume, cinder and vent and different directions of lava flow from the cinder cone during the 2018 eruptive phase of BIV. To visualize the major variations in thermal intensity and understand the behaviour of current volcanic activity, volcanic radiative power (VRP) and radiant fluxes of the recent eruptive phase were calculated using MIROVA. In addition, thermal anomaly was observed in the form of anomalous fire pixels for 44 days in FIRMS database. Also, NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS, VNP14IMGT) were used for validating the real-time activity of the 2018 volcanic eruption phase. The results obtained were closely related with the periods of high eruptions as observed in the Sentinel-2 datasets. The volcanic aerosol 'sulphur dioxide' (SO2) data (time series-area averaged) were analysed as well as a five-day forward trajectory and volcanic ash model for each eruption event was developed using HYSPLIT model to identify the transport pathways and extent of volcanic ash cloud in the lower atmosphere during the eruptive phase of the volcano.

TI  - Recent trends in the timing of the growing season in New Zealand's natural and semi-natural grasslands
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the temporal dynamics of shifts in phenological responses of a range of key stages of the growing season in New Zealand's three indigenous grassland types over the last 16 years (2001-2016). A near-daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to extract five annual growth phenology indices, namely the Start, End, Length, Peak and Peak NDVI of a growing season. The start of the growing season advanced (i.e. happened earlier) by a median of 7.2, 6.0 and 8.8 days per decade in Alpine, Tall Tussock and Low Producing grassland, whereas the end of the season advanced by a median of 4.5, 0.4 and 0.4 days in the three types respectively. The length of growing season was extended by 3.2, 5.2 and 7.1 days per decade in these three grassland types. Over 86% of the investigated grassland areas showed an advancing (earlier) start of the growing season, and 74% of Alpine grassland showed a trend toward an earlier end of season. Over 63% of all grassland types showed an increase in growing season length. A trend toward earlier growing season peak and overall increasing NDVI in the three grassland types indicate a tendency for increasing vegetation vitality in grassland ecosystems in recent years. The start of growing season was correlated with atmospheric pressure (negatively) and precipitation (positively) changes in winter-spring months, while the timing of the season end is positively correlated with air temperature and solar radiation in summer-autumn months. Our study shows that different grassland types differ in magnitude - but not in direction - of their recent shifts in timing of key growing season stages with high-alpine grasslands showing the strongest response. This study highlights the usefulness of remote sensing for monitoring ecosystem-level phenological shifts over large areas and long time periods.

TI  - Comparisons of numerical phenology models and machine learning methods on predicting the spring onset of natural vegetation across the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of vegetation spring onset is largely influenced by climate factors, making it sensitive to climate variation. Robust models that predict vegetation spring onset via the climate forcing data are needed in the land surface models for understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation processes. In this study, we apply and assess both numerical phenology models and the machine learning models on predicting the timing of spring onset for different vegetation types, including deciduous vegetation, evergreen vegetation and stressed deciduous vegetation. We perform model calibration for numerical phenology models and machine learning models using both in-situ observations of spring onset dates from National Phenology Network in the United States and satellite-derived green-up dates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our experiment showed better performance of numerical models calibrated by ground phenology observations. Among all the numerical phenology models, the models developed based on Growing Season Index perform well on predicting the spring onsets of deciduous vegetation and stressed deciduous vegetation across the Northern Hemisphere. Machine learning models if trained appropriately could also capture the spatial variation of satellite-derived spring onset dates. Our study highlights the need of improvements on numerical phenology models for their uses in the land surface models. We also illustrate the benchmarking role of the machine learning models on predicting vegetation spring onsets via climate variables.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Relative Radiometric Calibration Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the degeneration problem of sensors, calibration becomes a prerequisite step to retrieve consistent satellite images, especially for the ones from long-term time series. Relative calibration is an economic manner to address the problem. Previous studies leverage the identified no-change pixels (NCPs) between two images for relative calibration. However, the identification of NCPs itself is a very hard task and the inferior detection quality affects the performances significantly. Inspired by the great success of deep learning techniques, in this article, we first develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based relative calibration method, which bypasses the NCP detection. In particular, the ratio of sensor sensitivity coefficients at two time points is directly estimated by feeding the corresponding image pair into our developed CNN regressor. A polynomial function is fitted upon the estimated ratios in time series. We train the CNN regressor based on the multisite calibration results and then conduct experiments on FengYun-3A (FY-3A), FengYun-3B (FY-3B), and FengYun-3C (FY-3C). The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and it outperforms state-of-the-art NCP-based methods.

TI  - Development and evaluation of recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick assays for co-detection of epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus and the Palyam serogroup virus
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and the Palyam serogroup viruses (PALV) have led to significant economic losses associated with livestock production globally. A rapid, sensitive and specific method for the detection of EHDV and PALV is critical for virus detection, monitoring, and successful control and elimination of related diseases. Results In the present study, a recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) assay for the co-detection of genome segment 1 (Seg-1) of EHDV and PALV was developed and evaluated. The analytical sensitivities of the established RPA-LFD assay in the detection of EHDV and PALV were 7.1 copies/mu L and 6.8 copies/mu L, respectively. No cross-reaction with other members of the genus Orbivirus, including African horse sickness virus, bluetongue virus, Guangxi orbivirus, Tibet orbivirus and Yunnan orbivirus was observed. The established RPA-LFD assay accurately detected 39 EHDV strains belonging to 5 serotypes and 29 PALV strains belonging to 3 serotypes. The trace back results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and the established RPA-LFD assay on sentinel cattle were consistent. The coincidence rates of qRT-PCR and the established RPA-LFD assay in 56 blood samples from which EHDV or PALV had been isolated and 96 blood samples collected from cattle farms were more than 94.8 %. The results demonstrated that the established RPR-LFD assay is specific, sensitive and reliable, and could be applied in early clinical diagnosis of EHDV and PALV. Conclusions This study highlights the development and application of the RPA-LFD assay in the co-detection of EHDV and PALV for the first time. The assay could be used as a potential optional rapid, reliable, sensitive and low-cost method for field diagnosis of EHDV and PALV.

TI  - Salinity intrusion prediction using remote sensing and machine learning in data-limited regions: A case study in Vietnam's Mekong Delta
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - With population growth, the demand for land resources is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades. Maintaining the integrity of soil distribution requires a remarkable amount of work to deal with agricultural extension. Salinity intrusion monitoring is a crucial process, which directly affects sustainable development, especially in areas affected by global warming and in coastal zones. In recent years, various studies have used the soil-water salinity data to evaluate the spatiotemporal increase in salinity intrusion. This study aims to establish a novel framework for monitoring salinity intrusion using remote sensing and machine learning. It focuses on the salinity intrusion in soil, which affects water availability, food security, human health, etc. Numerous algorithms have been implemented to find the best solution for this issue, including Xgboost (XGR), Gaussian processes, support vector regression, deep neural networks, and the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). A total of 143 samples collected from 2016 to 2020 at 39 measurement stations were divided into two sets: 70% training and 30% testing. Thirty-one independent variables were used to develop the model. Vietnam's Mekong Delta, where the salinity intrusion problem is becoming increasingly serious due to global warming and demographics, was selected as the study area. Each of the proposed models was compared and evaluated by applying various statistical indices such as the root mean square error, coefficient of determination (R-2), and mean absolute error. The results show that the prediction model was built successfully by wielding data from the implemented salinity measurement stations, and the XGR-GOA model was better than the other models (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.076, and MAE = 0.065). This finding demonstrates the feasibility of estimating and monitoring salinity intrusion in data-limited regions by integrating optical satellite images and machine learning, which are easily and cost-effectively obtainable. The proposed conceptual methodology in our study is novel and provides additional useful information for the monitoring and management of salinity intrusion not only in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, but also in other sites that have similar natural and anthropological conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problem of actuator failure in satellite attitude control system, a fault diagnosis method based on recurrent neural network was proposed. The satellite attitude control system was modeled, fault analysis was carried out, continuous time fault data of star sensor and angular velocity gyro were collected. Six kinds of heterogeneous cyclic neural networks were designed to diagnose and classify the fault data, and the network effect was compared in terms of the network depth, feedback unit, activation function and training algorithm. The effect of deep loop neural network with GRU is better, the accuracy of fault diagnosis is 95.7%. The results show that, for time series satellite data, GRU and the recurrent neural network with a certain depth have better fault diagnosis effect.

TI  - A month for the mission: using a sentinel approach to determine the transmission window of digenean cercariae in the subarctic White Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the digenean life cycle the cercaria ensures an important transmission stage, from the first intermediate host to the second or the definitive host. In regions with pronounced seasonality, this process occurs within a certain interval, the transmission window. In high latitudes, the size of transmission window has previously been determined only by comparing data on seasonal dynamics of infection level in various categories of hosts or extrapolating the results of laboratory experiments on cercarial biology to natural conditions. In this study, we evaluated the dynamics of infection of the second intermediate hosts (mussels Mytilus edulis) with cercariae of two digenean species, Himasthla elongata (Himasthlidae) and Cercaria parvicaudata (Renicolidae), at a littoral site at the White Sea by exposing cages with uninfected mussels during the warm season. This is the first such study in a subarctic sea. Mussel infection was observed from May to mid-September, but its intensity was the greatest only for approximately a month, from some moment after 10 July to mid-August, when water temperature was within the optimal range for cercarial emergence in both studied species (15-20 degrees C). During this time, the mussels accumulated 66.3 +/- 6.2% metacercariae of H. elongata and 79.7 +/- 5.3% metacercariae of C. parvicaudata out of the total number accumulated during the experimental period. We suggest that climate warming at high latitudes may prolong the period when the water temperatures are optimal for cercariae emergence, thereby intensifying digenean transmission in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - From groundlessness-to freedom: The theme of 'awakening' in the thought of Lev Shestov
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - The philosopher Lev Shestov aimed to establish a new free way of thinking, which manifested itself as a struggle against the delusion that we have a rational grasp of the necessary truths on matters that are of the greatest importance to us, such as the questions of life and death. Philosophy, as the Russian philosopher understood it, is not pure thinking, but 'some kind of inner doing, inner regeneration, or second birth' (Shestov in Lektsii po Istorii Grecheskoi Filosofii [Lectures on the history of Greek philosophy], YMCA-PRESS, Moscow, 2001, p. 53). Having adopted the notion of the 'regeneration of one's convictions' from Dostoevsky's vocabulary in his earlier works, Shestov developed the idea of 'awakening' further in his mature thought, in which the motif of 'awakening' comprised one of the main ideas of his philosophy: the fight for the individual's right to freedom and to creative transformation at a time when she is in despair or on the brink of death. In this article, I analyse Shestov's idea of 'awakening' as one of the key tropes and developmental characteristics of his philosophical vision. In particular, I argue that, having stemmed from Shestov's earlier interpretations of Dostoevsky, Shakespeare and Plotinus, in his later writings, the notion of 'awakening'-the possibility of a fundamental, inner transformation of one's worldview (probuzhdenie, pererozhdenie)-marked the beginning of a new salvific mode in his writing.

TI  - Influence of Imaging Features and Technique on US-guided Tattoo Ink Marking of Axillary Lymph Nodes Removed at Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Women With Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To describe tattoo ink marking of axillary lymph nodes (TIMAN) and the elements leading to successful removal at sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: An IRB-approved retrospective image review was conducted of breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB after TIMAN from February 2013 to August 2017, noting patient and tattooed lymph node (TLN) features, initial biopsy type, time to surgery, if the TLN was identified at surgery, and correlation with the SLN. Cases were divided into two groups: the presurgical group, which had primary surgery, and the pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) group, which underwent surgery after completing NACT.Results: Of 30 patients who underwent 32 TIMAN procedures, 10 (33.3%) were presurgical and 20 (66.7%) were pre-NACT. The average lymph node (LN) depth from the skin was 1.6 cm, with an average of 0.3 mL of tattoo ink injected. Of 32 procedures, 29 (90.6%) had US images demonstrating the injection. Of these, 10 (34.5%) were injected in the LN cortex surface and 19 (65.5%) in the middle cortex. Seven (24.1%) were injected in the LN lateral aspect, 12 (41.4%) in the mid aspect, and 10 (34.5%) in the medial aspect. Of 32 LNs, 28 (87.5%) were tattooed immediately after initial biopsy and 4 (12.5%) at a later date. At SLNB, all 32 (100%) TLNs were identified, all correlated with the SLN, and 10 (31.3%) were positive for cancer.Conclusion: Using an average of 0.3 mL of tattoo ink, all TLNs were successfully identified for removal at surgery, despite variability in LN and injection factors.

TI  - Above-ground biomass change estimation using national forest inventory data with Sentinel-2 and Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at estimating total forest above-ground net change (Delta AGB; Gg) over five years (2014-2019) based on model-assisted estimation utilizing freely available satellite imagery. The study was conducted for a boreal forest area (approx. 1.4 Mha) in Norway where bi-temporal national forest inventory (NFI), Sentinel-2, and Landsat data were available. Biomass change was modelled based on a direct approach. The precision of estimates using only the NFI data in a basic expansion estimator was compared to four different alternative model-assisted estimates using 1) Sentinel-2 or Landsat data, and 2) using bi- or uni-temporal remotely sensed data. We found that spaceborne optical data improved the precision of the purely field-based estimates by a factor of up to three. The most precise estimates were found for the model-assisted estimation using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 (standard error; SE = 1.7 Gg). However, the decrease in precision when using Landsat data was small (SE = 1.92 Gg). We also found that Delta AGB could be precisely estimated when remotely sensed data were available only at the end of the monitoring period. We conclude that satellite optical data can considerably improve Delta AGB estimates, when repeated and coincident field data are available. The free availability, global coverage, frequent update, and long-term time horizon make data from programs such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat a valuable data source for consistent and durable monitoring of forest carbon dynamics.

TI  - Decadal changes in land degradation status of India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust data on the spatial distribution of land degradation is important for resource conservation planning. Spatial land degradation status of India was mapped using multi-temporal Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-III) data acquired from Resourcesat-1/2 during 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 under the Natural Resources Census programme of the Indian Space Research Organisation. Heads-up on-screen visual interpretation of multi-season satellite data was carried out, supported by digital elevation model and other historical maps available. Visual interpretation cues were developed and employed across various partner institutions to achieve consistency in mapping. The outputs were subjected to two-stage quality check. Results indicate that the total land degradation of India was 91.2 M ha (27.77% of the geographical extent of the country) during 2015-2016 against 91.3 M ha during 2005-2006. During the ten-year period, there was an overall decrease of around 0.1 M ha in degraded land. However, noticeable intra- and inter-class changes were observed in land degradation during the ten-year period. Major reclamation was noticed in sand dunes which were converted into crop lands by levelling them. Substantial decrease in severity and extent of salt-affected soils was noticed in Uttar Pradesh.

TI  - Development of multivariate integrated drought monitoring index (MIDMI) for Warangal region of Telangana, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is one of the most frequent natural disasters in India's southern part. Remote sensing-based drought indices give advantages in terms of continuous monitoring of land surface. The crop production in the Warangal region in India's southern part is adversely affected due to insufficient rainfall and poor irrigation management. This study aims to develop a multivariate remote sensing-based composite drought index (CDI) to monitor the agricultural drought. Landsat-8 satellite data for all the 11 subregions of Warangal urban and 15 subregions of the rural district of Telangana from 2013 to 2020 for the month of May is used to obtain drought indices. The drought indices are used in this study to develop MIDMI and are compared according to the percentage area of the Warangal region under five different drought categories. In this study, the MIDMI is computed by a weighted average of five vegetation drought indices for the Warangal region as per the method developed by Iyengar and Sudarshan for the multivariate data. MIDMI for all the 26 subregions of the Warangal rural and Warangal Urban Districts is between 0.4 and 0.6, which makes the Warangal region moderately vulnerable to agricultural drought.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Topsoil Organic Matter Content Mapping Across Desertified Land in Northern China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) content is an effective indicator of desertification; thus, monitoring its spatial-temporal changes on a large scale is important for combating desertification. However, mapping SOM content in desertified land is challenging owing to the heterogeneous landscape, relatively low SOM content and vegetation coverage. Here, we modeled the SOM content in topsoil (0-20 cm) of desertified land in northern China by employing a high spatial resolution dataset and machine learning methods, with an emphasis on quarterly green and non-photosynthetic vegetation information, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results show: 1) the machine learning model performed better than the traditional multiple linear regression model (MLR) for SOM content estimation, and the Random Forest (RF) model was more accurate than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model; 2) the quarterly information regarding green vegetation and non-photosynthetic were identified as key covariates for estimating the SOM content in desertified land, and an obvious improvement could be observed after simultaneously combining the Dead Fuel Index (DFI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the four quarters (R-2 increased by 0.06, the root mean square error decreased by 0.05, the ratio of prediction deviation increased by 0.2, and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance increased by 0.5). In particular, the effects of the DFI in Q1 (the first quarter) and Q2 (the second quarter) on estimating low SOM content (<1%) were identified; finally, a timely (2019) and high spatial resolution (30 m) SOM content map for the desertified land in northern China was drawn which shows obvious advantages over existing SOM products, thus providing key data support for monitoring and combating desertification.

TI  - Analysis of Genetic Alterations Related to DNA Methylation in Testicular Germ Cell Tumors Based on Data Mining
T2  - CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Embryonal carcinoma (EC) and seminoma (SE) are both derived from germ cell neoplasia in situ but show big differences in growth patterns and clinical prognosis. Epigenetic regulation may play an important role in the development of EC and SE. This study investigated the DNA methylation-based genetic alterations between EC and SE by analyzing the datasets of mRNA expression and DNA methylation profiling. The datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between EC and SE by limma package in R environment. Gene function enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed on the DAVID tool, the results of which suggested differences in capability of pluripotency and genomic stability between EC and SE. The minfi package and wANNOVAR tool were used to identify differentially methylated genes. A total of 37 genes were discovered with both mRNA expression and the accordant DNA methylation changes. The findings were verified by the sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Finally, 5 genes (PRDM1, LMO2, FAM53B, HCN4, and FAM124B) were found that showed both low expression and high methylation in EC, and were significantly associated with relapse-free survival. The findings of methylation-based genetic features between EC and SE might be helpful in studying the role of DNA methylation in cancer development.

TI  - CNN Cloud Detection Algorithm Based on Channel and Spatial Attention and Probabilistic Upsampling for Remote Sensing Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of remote sensing image, how to transmit image information more efficiently with limited bandwidth has always been a research hotspot. Compared with other ground objects, cloud pixels in remote sensing image are invalid information, so it is a meaningful research work to remove cloud before transmitting image and reduce the waste of useless information. In remote sensing image, due to the existence of thin clouds and the complexity of the underlying surface, most of the cloud detection algorithms struggle to achieve effective separation of clouds and ground objects. A deep learning (DL) cloud detection algorithm based on attention mechanism and probability upsampling has been proposed in this article. In order to enhance the information of the key areas, in the channel attention module, crucial information is highlighted in the channel dimension of the encoder, and the useless information is weakened. The spatial attention module is in the spatial dimension. The information fusion between each point in the image is strengthened. To reduce the information loss caused by the down-sampling module, a probabilistic upsampling block (PUB) is proposed to restore the image. Eventually, experiments are performed on Gaofen-1WFV data, and the results indicate that the algorithm proposed in this article has better detection results than other cloud detection algorithms in different scenarios.

TI  - Combining time series and land cover data for analyzing spatio-temporal changes in mangrove forests: A case study of Qinglangang Nature Reserve, Hainan, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests have important social, ecological, and economic value in coastal ecosystems. However, they are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world and are widely threatened due to their unique location along the land-sea interface. Thus, mangrove conservation based on scientific and effective monitoring methods is essential. In this study, a method for analyzing the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove forests was proposed in Qinglangang Nature Reserve, Hainan Province, China. This method combined multiple time series analysis (including Theil-Sen median trend analysis, Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst exponent) with land cover data from Landsat and Sentinel-1/2 to provide a clearer geographic explanation for changes in mangrove forests. The study showed that high-resolution data performs better than low-resolution data, optical indices are more ideal than SAR indices, and EVI is more advantageous than NDVI for mangrove time series analysis. The results revealed that mangroves in Qinglangang have experienced a severe degradation stage (1987-2003), a slow improvement stage (2003-2013), and a coexistence of improvement and degradation stage (2013-2020). In all stages, the main causes of mangrove degradation are anthropogenic factors, such as development of aquaculture ponds and building land, and natural factors caused by typhoons and sea-level rise. The anthropogenic factors have a broader and longer impact and should be a focus of future studies. The improvement in mangrove forests is due to habitat quality restoration and artificial planting, which is shown to be quite effective.

TI  - The operational role of remote sensing in assessing and predicting land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature using machine learning algorithms in Rajshahi, Bangladesh
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activity has boosted carbon dioxide emissions, causing temperatures to rise. The average temperature on Earth is roughly 15 degrees C, but it has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural climatic changes, but experts say temperatures are already rising faster than at any other period in history. Unplanned urbanization can sometimes backfire, causing negative consequences that harm the economy and contribute to environmental damages, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. Because of the strong association between land use/land cover and land surface temperature (LST), the study attempted to analyze and estimate LULC and seasonal (both summer and winter) LSTs using Landsat satellite images at 5-year intervals from 1995 to 2020. Later, the study forecasted both LULC and seasonal LSTs for 2030 and 2040 using cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms for Rajshahi district. As supporting parameters for determining the magnitude of climate change effects owing to urbanization and temperature rise, primary data collection procedures such as focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) with experts from diverse sectors were used. Results reveal that the built-up area was increased from 158.22 km(2) (6.64%) to 386.74 km(2) (16.23%) in this 25 years' timeframe, and it contributed the highest average temperature (41.68 degrees C in 2020 in summer) comparing with other LULCs. The LSTs were increasing at an alarming rate with 1-2 degrees C standard deviations per 5 years and maximum temperature was increased from 1995 to 2020 by 37.22 to 42.7 degrees C) in summer and 22.18 to 28.94 degrees C in winter. Prediction states that net increase of built-up area will be 2.51 and 5.29, respectively, in 2030 and 2050 from 2020. Maximum LST will likely to be increased to 43.23 degrees C (2030) and 45.92 degrees C (2040) in summer, and 30.94 degrees C (2030) and 31.77 degrees C (2040) in winter. FGDs and KIIs assessments indicate that frequent LULC change was the main reason for increasing LSTs (71%) and 76% experts agreed that heat waves are the most influencing factors for adverse climate change, among other parameters. The work introduces new methods for integrating remote sensing data with primary datasets, which will provide substantial insights to urban planners and policymakers in terms of participatory and sustainable planning.

TI  - Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 monitoring as a community-level COVID-19 trend tracker and variants in Ohio, United States
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 129 million confirm cases. Many health authorities around the world have implemented wastewater-based epidemiology as a rapid and complementary tool for the COVID-19 surveillance system and more recently for variants of concern emergence tracking. In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1 and N2 gene regions, and E gene) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n = 250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearman's r = 0.70, p < 0.05), with the N2 gene region being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models. Viral sequencing showed that shifts in strain-defining variants of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples matched those in clinical isolates from the same time periods. The findings from this study support that wastewater surveillance is effective in COVID-19 trend tracking and provide sentinel warning of variant emergence and transmission within various types of communities.

TI  - Measuring the Impact of the COVID-19 Shutdown on Great Lakes Water Quality Using Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The states of Michigan and Ohio issued shutdown orders in mid-March 2020 in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), resulting in widespread disruption to economic and human activity. This study, which was commissioned by NASA headquarters, utilized satellite remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite to investigate whether these changes in activity led to any short-term changes in water quality in the Great Lakes region by comparing 2020 data to a historic baseline. The water quality parameters examined included chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, water clarity, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) extent. These parameters were investigated in two Great Lakes basins which experience significant anthropogenic pressure: the western basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron (SBLH). TSS concentrations in April 2020 were below the historic baseline in both basins, and largely remained low until September. SBLH also experienced elevated CHL concentrations in April which persisted through the summer. Additionally, the WBLE HAB extent was down in 2020 after an early end to the growing season. However, this investigation found that the COVID-19 shutdowns were likely not a direct driver of these short-term anomalies. Instead, recent trends in the indicators and co-occurring anomalies in hydrological and meteorological conditions (e.g., lake temperature, river discharge, and wind speed) appeared to be more responsible for the detected water quality changes. Future work will investigate whether the shutdowns have a long-term or delayed impact on Great Lakes water quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND</p>& nbsp;</p>Axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard treatment for patients with clinically and pathological negative lymph nodes. However, the role of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is debated.</p>& nbsp;</p>AIM</p>& nbsp;</p>To identify a subgroup of women with high axillary tumor burden undergoing SLNB in whom cALND can be safely omitted in order to reduce the risk of long-term complications and create a Preoperative Clinical Risk Index (PCRI) that helps us in our clinical practice to optimize the selection of these patients.</p>& nbsp;</p>METHODS</p>& nbsp;</p>Patients with positive SLNB who underwent a cALND were included in this study. Univariate and multivariate analysis of prognostic and predictive factors were used to create a PCRI for safely omitting cALND.</p>& nbsp;</p>RESULTS</p>& nbsp;</p>From May 2007 to April 2014, we performed 1140 SLN biopsies, of which 125 were positive for tumor and justified to practice a posterior cALND. Pathologic findings at SLNB were micrometastases (mic) in 29 cases (23.4%) and macrometastasis (MAC) in 95 cases (76.6%). On univariate analysis of the 95 patients with MAC, statistically significant factors included: age, grade, phenotype, histology, lymphovascular invasion, lymph-node tumor size, and number of positive SLN. On multivariate analysis, only lymph-node tumor size (& LE; 20 mm) and number of positive SLN (> 1) retained significance. A numerical tool was created giving each of the parameters a value to predict preoperatively which patients would not benefit from cALND. Patients with a PCRI & LE; 15 has low probability (< 10%) of having additional lymph node involvement, a PRCI between 15-17.6 has a probability of 43%, and the probability increases to 69% in patients with a PCRI > 17.6.</p>& nbsp;</p>CONCLUSION</p>& nbsp;</p>The PCRI seems to be a useful tool to prospectively estimate the risk of nodal involvement after positive SLN and to identify those patients who could omit cALND. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate PCRI clinical generalization.</p>

T2  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Space technology offers effective tools to monitor the status of World Natural Heritage sites. East Rennell Island, which covers approximately 37,000 hectares (ha) and a marine area extending three nautical miles into the sea, was added to the list of endangered World Natural Heritage sites in 2013. Deforestation and natural disasters have increasingly threatened sustainable development on the island. Based on analyses of multi-source time series of remote sensing data (e.g., MODIS and Worldview), the forest cover change on Rennell Island from 2000 to 2020 and its future trends were mapped and analysed using Sen + Mann-Kendall and Hurst index models. A land cover classification system derived from high-resolution Worldview images was developed as a baseline for monitoring and analysing future forest cover changes on the island. Our results showed that (1) the areas of vegetation degradation and improvement were basically equal from 2000 to 2020. (2) The forest cover change trend had weak continuity, and significant improvements could be achieved in areas with damaged vegetation given sufficient protection measures and financial input. (3) This heritage site has a strong vegetation regeneration ability, and human activities such as mining, logging, and road construction, which could greatly disturb the unique ecosystem, should be restricted.

TI  - Celastrol Exerts Cardioprotective Effect in Rheumatoid Arthritis by Inhibiting TLR2/HMGB1 Signaling Pathway-Mediated Autophagy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which lead to increased riskfor heart diseases. This study aims to explore the possible effect and mechanism of Celastrol on RA induced cardiac impairments in rats. Methods: Collagen induced RA wistar rat models (CIA) were established for the measurement on secondary foot swelling degree, polyarthritis index score, spleen and thymus index. Pathological morphology was observed using H&E staining. Heart fibrosis was measured after Sirius red staining, while cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining. For in vitro experiments, rat cardiomyocytes were isolated to determine the inflammatory cytokine secretion and cell apoptosis using ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Protein expressions of related index and autophagy were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Results: CIA rat model was successfully established and characterized by severe secondary foot swelling degree, and increased polyarthritis index score and spleen and thymus index. Synovial hyperplasia, disordered cardiomyocytes, cell infiltration and fibrosis were also observed in CIA rat model. Compared with CIA model, Celastrol treatment could suppress the release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, as well as inhibiting the expressions of Bax, cleaved caspase3, collagen I, collagen III and alpha-SMA. In addition to that, Celastrol treatment can attenuate cell apoptosis and fibrosis of cardiomyocytes and elevate Bcl-2 expression. RA induced cell autophagy can be suppressed by Celastrol through inhibiting the activation of TLR2/HMGB1 signal pathway. Conclusion: Celastrol can regulate TLR2/HMGB1 signal pathway to suppress autophagy and therefore exert cardioprotective effect in RA.

TI  - A fast radiometric correction method for Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Radiometric calibration is a method that estimates the reflection of the target from the measured input radiation. The purpose of this study is to radiometrically calibrate three spectral bands of Sentinel-2A, including green, red and infrared. For this purpose, Landsat-8 OLI data are used. Because they have bands with the same wavelength range and they have the same structure. As a result, Landsat-8 OLI is appropriate for relative radiometric calibration. Design/methodology/approach The method used in this study is radiometric calibration uncorrected data from a sensor with corrected data from another sensor. Also, another aim of this study is a comparison between radiometric correction data and data that, in addition to radiometric correction, has been sharpened with panchromatic data. In this method, both of them have been used for radiometric calibration. Calibration coefficients have been obtained using the first-order polynomial equation. Findings This study showed that the corrected data has more valid answers than corrected and sharpened data. This method studied three land-cover types, including soil, water and vegetation, which it obtained the most accurate coefficients of calibration for soil class because R-square in all three bands was above 88%, and the root mean square error in all three bands was below 0.01. In the case of water and vegetation classes, only results of red and infrared bands were suitable. Originality/value For validating this method, the radiometric correction module of SNAP software was used. According to the results, the coefficient of radiometric calibration of the Landsat-8 sensor was very close to the coefficients obtained from the corrected data by SNAP.

TI  - Preoperative axillary ultrasonography in patients with breast cancer: a prospective study to evaluate its ability to predict axillary tumor load.
T2  - Radiologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the ability of axillary ultrasonography to predict the number of lymph nodes with metastases found in sentinel node axillary surgery or axillary lymph node resection in patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer after percutaneous biopsy.METHODS: This prospective study included patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer by percutaneous biopsy. Axillary lymph nodes were classified at ultrasound examination as suspicious or not suspicious, and the number of suspicious nodes was compared with the number classified as suspicious in the surgical specimen.RESULTS: We included 142 patients, 4 of whom had bilateral cancer; 133 of the 146 tumors were clinically classified as T1-T2 N0. The median number of suspicious lymph nodes at ultrasound was 2 (1-6), and the median number of suspicious lymph nodes in the surgical biopsy specimen was 1 (1-16); the difference was not significant (p=0.1). The correlation between the number of positive lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound and the number of metastatic lymph nodes in the surgical specimen was 72.7% p=0.0002 and the concordance was 79% (95%CI 62.4%-95.6%) p=0.0001. For diagnosing high axillary tumor load (≥3 metastatic lymph nodes) versus low axillary tumor load (<3 metastatic lymph nodes), axillary ultrasound had 86.6% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, 92% PPV, and 71.4% NPV.CONCLUSION: Our results show that preoperative axillary ultrasound can differentiate between low and high tumor load and can be used as a tool to select the type of treatment. These results need to be confirmed in randomized multicenter studies.

TI  - Multi-season unmixing of vegetation class fractions across diverse Californian ecoregions using simulated spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne imaging spectrometers are expected to facilitate regional-scale vegetation analyses with multi-season hyperspectral imagery. However, we still lack a better understanding on both whether multi-season hyper spectral approaches are favorable over single-season approaches, as well as on the benefits of hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. Our study investigates the potential of multi-season unmixing of simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data for vegetation class fraction mapping across diverse natural and semi-natural ecoregions in California, USA. We utilized spring, summer and fall 2013 simulated EnMAP imagery derived from Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data covering study sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe and Santa Barbara. Regression-based unmixing with synthetic training datasets from spectral libraries was implemented for mapping needleleaf tree, broadleaf tree, shrub, herbaceous and non-vegetation fractions, and independent reference data was used for validation. Multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP had average Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) over all classes of 8.7% for the Bay Area, 8.5% for Lake Tahoe and 9.6% for Santa Barbara. However, larger errors in the low and high end of the fraction range remained, particularly in open-canopy woodlands and xeric shrub-dominated regions. Single season unmixing of simulated EnMAP revealed large seasonal and regional variations within individual vegetation classes. In most cases, the best performing single-season unmixing had similar errors as the multi-season unmixing, i.e., increment MAEs within +/- 1.0%. This points to the advantage of the multi-season integration strategy for more robust and generalized mapping independent from season and study site. Relative to EnMAP analyses, multi-season unmixing of multispectral Landsat composites for the same seasons yielded increases in average MAEs of +1.7%, +2.3% and +1.4% for the three study sites. This indicates that the higher spectral resolution of simulated EnMAP provides more relevant discriminative information when comparing contemporary image pairs. Unmixing of seasonal spectral-temporal metrics (STMs) from all available Landsat images for an entire year took advantage of the full temporal detail provided by these ongoing missions. We found Landsat STMs to effectively map vegetation class fractions, with average MAEs of 9.9%, 10.0% and 9.7% for the three study sites. Still, improvements particularly for mapping fractions of the woody vegetation classes through multi-season unmixing of simulated EnMAP point to the benefit of high spectral resolution data, and we assume that a comparable higher temporal resolution of hyperspectral satellites will further positively influence results. Overall, we conclude that multi-season unmixing of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data holds great potential for advancing vegetation class fraction mapping across natural and semi-natural ecosystems.

TI  - Response of net reduction rate in vegetation carbon uptake to climate change across a unique gradient zone on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has a variety of vegetation types that range from alpine tundra to tropic evergreen forest, which play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle and is extremely vulnerable to climate change. The vegetation C uptake is crucial to the ecosystem C sequestration. Moreover, net reduction in vegetation C uptake (NRVCU) will strongly affect the C balance of terrestrial ecosystem. Until now, there is limited knowledge on the recovery process of vegetation net C uptake and the spatial-temporal patterns of NRVCU after the disturbance that caused by climate change and human activities. Here, we used the MODIS-derived net primary production to characterize the spatial-temporal patterns of NRVCU. We further explored the influence factors of the net reduction rate in vegetation C uptake (NRRVCU) and recovery processes of vegetation net C uptake across a unique gradient zone on the TP. Results showed that the total net reduction amount of vegetation C uptake gradually decreased from 2000 to 2015 on the TP (Slope = -0.002, P < 0.05). Specifically, an increasing gradient zone of multi-year average of net reduction rate in vegetation carbon uptake (MYANRRVCU) from east to west was observed. In addition, we found that the recovery of vegetation net C uptake after the disturbance caused by climate change and anthropogenic disturbance in the gradient zone were primarily dominated by precipitation and temperature. The findings revealed that the effects of climate change on MYANRRVCU and vegetation net C uptake recovery differed significantly across geographical space and vegetation types. Our results highlight that the biogeographic characteristics of the TP should be considered for combating future climate change.

TI  - Integrating spatio-temporal-spectral information for downscaling Sentinel-3 OLCI images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-3 is a newly launched satellite implemented by the European Space Agency (ESA) for global observation. The Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) sensor onboard Sentinel-3 provides 21 band images with a fine spectral resolution and is of great value for ocean, land and atmospheric monitoring. The two platforms (Sentinel-3A and -3B) can provide OLCI images at an almost daily temporal resolution. The coarse spatial resolution of the 21 band OLCI images (i.e., 300 m), however, limits greatly their utility for local, precise monitoring. Sentinel-2, another satellite provided by ESA, carries the Multispectral Imager (MSI) sensor which can supply much finer spatial resolution (e.g., 10 m and 20 m) images. This paper introduces a new fusion framework integrating spatio-temporal-spectral information for downscaling Sentinel-3 OLCI images, which has two parts. Based on bands with similar wavelengths (i.e., bands 2, 3, 4 and 8a for Sentinel-2 and bands Oa4, Oa6, Oa8 and Oa17 for Sentinel-3), the four Sentinel-3 bands are first downscaled to the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images by applying spatio-temporal fusion to Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI images. Then, to take full advantage of all 21 available OLCI bands of the Sentinel-3 images, the extended image pair-based spatio-spectral fusion (EIPSSF) method is proposed in this paper to downscale the other 17 bands. EIPSSF is performed based on the new concept of the extended image pair (EIP) and by exploiting existing spatio-temporal fusion approaches. The framework consisting of spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral fusion is entirely general, which provides a practical solution for comprehensive downscaling of Sentinel-3 OLCI images for fine spatial, temporal and spectral resolution monitoring.

TI  - Feasibility of arm-draining lymph node-sparing radiotherapy of breast cancer: A pilot planning study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Lymphoedema following axillary radiotherapy for breast cancer causes significant morbidity. Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility of sparing the lymph node that drains the arm's lymphatics (ARM node) while achieving standard dose constraints for whole breast and comprehensive lymph node irradiation. Methods Six patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT CT to identify the breast sentinel node (SN) and ARM node. The ARM node was contoured on the SPECT CT and deformably registered to the radiotherapy treatment planning CT. Radiotherapy plans (50 Gy in 25 fractions) with VMAT technique were generated, with the aim to spare the ARM node (Mean dose <25 Gy) and achieve adequate coverage to the remaining axilla. The plan required the breast SN site (clip + 10 mm surrounding the clip) to achieve D98% > 47.5 Gy, and axillary nodal CTV excluding ARM node to achieve D90% > 45 Gy. Results In one patient, the ARM node was within the volume of breast SN site and sparing was not possible. For the remaining 5 patients, an ARM node-sparing plan could be successfully generated; the mean dose to the ARM node ranged from 11.2 to 23.1 Gy (median 13.8 Gy). In these 5 subjects, D90% > 45 Gy of axillary nodal CTV (range, 44.9-48.5 Gy, median 46.2 Gy) and D98% > 47.5 Gy of breast SN site were achieved. Conclusion In this planning study, ARM node-sparing VMAT of the breast and lymph nodes was feasible, while maintaining adequate dosimetric coverage. However, in some individuals, localization of the ARM node in close proximity to breast SN site precluded the generation of an ARM node-sparing treatment plan.

TI  - Effect of Gender to Fat Deposition in Yaks Based on Transcriptomic and Metabolomics Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fat deposition in yaks plays an important part in survival, multiplication, and meat quality. In this work, the characteristic of fat deposition in male yaks (MYs) and female yaks (FYs) and the regulations of gender to yak fat deposition were explored by mRNA-Seq and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. FYs possessed a higher body fat rate (BFR) of visceral fat, fat content in longissimus dorsi (LD) and liver, and subcutaneous fat thickness (p < 0.05). The fat and cholesterol synthesis in liver and the fat transport in FY blood increased. The fat metabolism in yaks is the combined effect of carbohydrate, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and an increase of triglyceride (TG) synthesis was accompanied by an increase of steroid synthesis. The high levels of myo-inositol and cortisol (COR) (p < 0.01) activated the calcium signaling in FY subcutaneous fat, followed by the increase of adipocyte secretion, and resulted in more leptin (LEP) secretion (p < 0.01). Then peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling was activated by the focal adhesions and ECM-receptor interaction. Finally, the TG and steroid synthesis increased by the expression regulation of ME1, SCD, ELOVL6, DGAT2, DBI, LPL, CPT1, PLIN1, LIPA, DHCR24, and SQLE gene. The above genes can be considered as the candidate genes for yak with higher fat amount in molecular breeding in the future. This study can provide a theoretical basis for improving the meat quality and breeding of yaks.

TI  - Impacts of climate change-related flood events in the Yangtze River Basin based on multi-source data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global losses caused by floods are gradually increasing under the influence of climate change and human activities. The Yangtze River (YR) economic belt has continued to experience frequent flood disasters over the years; therefore, clarifying the significant flood risk factors is highly relevant for the development of the region. In this study, we investigated the flood risk factors in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) during 2002-2018 based on meteorological data, reconstructed terrestrial water storage (TWS) data from Gravity Recovery Climate Experiment (GRACE) (GRACE-TWS), and Landsat data. The major conclusions were as follows: (1) the principal components (i.e., the first, third, and fourth principal components (PC1, PC3, and PC4)) of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at a 12-month scale (SPEI12) were more significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with teleconnection indices (i.e., Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Southern Oscillation Indices (SOO, and Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (MEI)), than the SPEI at 6-month scale (SPEI6) in the YRB during 2002-2018; (2) the changes in water bodies reflected by Landsat data (i.e., Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 OLI) for the YRB confirmed the wet periods (i.e., 2002-2005, 2010, 2012-2013, and 2015-2018) monitored by SPEI (i.e., SPEI6 and SPEI12); and (3) while the Pearson correlation coefficients indicated a significant linear relationship between the major hydrological factors (e.g., precipitation, runoff, GRACE-TWS, flood potential index (FPI), and soil moisture (SM)) in the YRB, the precipitation detected by the GRACE-TWS and SM with one-month lag phase, had the maximum correlation coefficients of 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. Significant relationships (r(2) = 0.48 and r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.05) were found between variable infiltration capacity (VIC)-runoff and predicted runoffs based on these factors (i.e., precipitation, GRACE-TWS, flood potential index (FPI), and SM) and the random forest regression. This study provides significant hydrological information and contributes to approaches aimed at supporting climate resilience and investments in the YRB.

TI  - De-escalating Local Treatment for Women with Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - De-escalating therapy in breast cancer means doing less to achieve the same outcomes. Surgery to the breast de-escalated from the Halsted radical mastectomy to the modified radical mastectomy, and then to breast-conserving surgery (BCS), which is the current standard of care for early breast cancer. BCS includes a course of radiotherapy, which was de-escalated from a 6-week course to a 3-week course, with a boost to the tumour bed. As the majority of local recurrences occur in the quadrant where the primary tumour was located, a single intraoperative dose of radiotherapy to the cavity at the time of surgery in selected patients was equivalent to whole breast irradiation with a boost to the tumour bed. In tandem with de-escalating surgery to the breast, a full axillary dissection was de-escalated to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node-negative patients. In patients with large tumours where breast conservation is not possible, neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) can safely de-escalate a mastectomy to BCS. NAST can also downstage an axillary node-positive cancer to a node-negative one, so that SLNB can be performed. Lesser surgery will lead to less complications and thus a better quality of life. Current research is focused on treating breast cancer with systemic therapy alone, and selecting out a group of patients where breast or axillary surgery is not required. A major concern of de-escalating surgery is that some women may be undertreated and hence have poorer outcomes. A discussion on the pros and cons of de-escalating surgery is important when offering the choice to women.

T2  - Zhonghua yi xue za zhi
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of functional axillary dissection based on lymphatic drainage (FUND) in decreasing breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) events. Methods: A total of 168 eligible patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from July 2018 to February 2019 were randomly assigned to the FUND group or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) group using random number table generated by SPSS. In the FUND group, methylene blue (MB) was adopted to reveal the sentinel lymph node (SLN) for all patients; 0.1 ml MB was injected into the SLNs before resection to reveal the efferent lymphatic channels and subsequent-echelon lymph node. The blue-stained lymphatic channels were mapped by bluntly dissecting along the lymphatic drainage channels from the breast to the axilla. Then, the SLNs were removed and pathologically analyzed by immediate frozen sectioning (FS); if the SLNs were positive, the blue-stained bALNs in breast lymphatic level (BLL) Ⅱ were removed and sent for immediate FS; if the blue-stained ALNs in BLL Ⅱ were confirmed negative, the tissues in BLL Ⅱ were removed'en bloc'. Clinicopathologic information for all the patients in the two groups were collected. The fixed-point circumference volume measurement method and the Norman questionnaire scoring method were used to evaluate the arm lymphedema between the two groups. Clinicopathological characteristics, incidences of arm lymphedema, locoregional recurrence, and distant metastasis between the two groups were compared. Results: The mean age were (50.3±8.0) in the FUND group and (51.1±9.0) in the ALND group. Seventy-four cases (88.1%) in the FUND group successfully underwent FUND surgery, and patients whose breast lymphatics failed to be stained blue underwent standard ALND. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of age, BMI, histological types, surgical approaches and adjunct therapy between the FUND group (n=74) and ALND group (n=84) (P>0.05). The average operation time of the FUND group and the stand ALND group were (169±15) and (123±12) min respectively (range: 145-198, 103-146 min) (P<0.001), and the number of lymph nodes removed [M (Q1, Q3)] were 8.3 (6, 15) and 12.9 (7, 18) (P=0.019). The cumulative BCRL rate, within a median follow-up of 24 months and 23 months respectively for FUND and ALND group, were 10.8% (8/74) vs 23.8% (20/84) (P=0.033) measured by fixed-point circumference volume measurement method, and was 12.2% (9/74) vs 27.4% (23/84) by Norman questionnaire (P=0.018). There were no local regional recurrence events during the follow-up period between the two groups. Conclusion: For breast cancer patients with clinically node-positive axilla or positive SLN, FUND based on lymphatic drainage was a less radical axillary surgery, with which eliminating the risk of BCRL might be achieved.

TI  - Croplands intensify regional and global warming according to satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Croplands, occupying approximately 13% of the Earth's land surface, can dramatically alter surface temperature via multiple biophysical processes. However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent croplands warm or cool the land surface globally. Here we present new evidence of the temperature effects of global croplands based on high-resolution satellite observations of land surface temperature (LST). We find general daytime warming and nighttime cooling of crop-dominated lands (cropland intensity >= 90%) relative to other vegetation cover, with net daily cooling in the arid zone and net daily warming in all other areas. On a per-pixel basis, however, nearly half of the crop-dominated lands cool daytime LST and/or warm nighttime LST. The temperature effects vary greatly by location and season. The per-pixel intensity can exceed 10 degrees C likely due to the changes in surface evapotranspiration, albedo, and background climate. By extending the LST changes of crop-dominated lands to the full land surface, we find that croplands make large contributions to regional and global land surface warming. Daytime warming can reach 0.56 degrees C in Europe during spring. Nationally, China, India, and Brazil lead the warming due to their large cropland areas and strong local climate effects. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the biophysical effects of croplands for projecting climate change and formulating adaptation and mitigation strategies.

AB  - Global warming and Climatic changes in common are the most famous topics in the present days, to study the substantial size of this problem an advancement in the data collecting sensors and platform is taking place to increase the measurement's density and frequency, this led to the generation of a huge amount of data. Data include Temperature, Pressure, and water vapor consider one of the foremost important parameters within the atmosphere. Accurate measurements of water vapor pressure within the troposphere are significant for understanding and precursor weather changes also it is important to follow the global warming progression. In this research, we tried generating a modest computer program that can handle this kind of data and represent a tool to help climatologist to deal with this data, the program read and collect separated data file, plot climatic daily variables, and calculates the average total precipitable water from Global Positioning satellite radio occultation. The program results are formed in 2D and 3D global figures that can visualize the measured atmospheric parameters, in addition to the calculation of the total precipitable water.

TI  - Comparative assessment of TROPOMI and OMI formaldehyde observations and validation against MAX-DOAS network column measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), launched in October 2017 on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, monitors the composition of the Earth's atmosphere at an unprecedented horizontal resolution as fine as 3.5 x 5.5 km(2). This paper assesses the performances of the TROPOMI formaldehyde (HCHO) operational product compared to its predecessor, the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) HCHO QA4ECV product, at different spatial and temporal scales. The parallel development of the two algorithms favoured the consistency of the products, which facilitates the production of long-term combined time series. The main difference between the two satellite products is related to the use of different cloud algorithms, leading to a positive bias of OMI compared to TROPOMI of up to 30% in tropical regions. We show that after switching off the explicit correction for cloud effects, the two datasets come into an excellent agreement. For medium to large HCHO vertical columns (larger than 5 x 10(15) molec.cm(-2)) the median bias between OMI and TROPOMI HCHO columns is not larger than 10% (< 0.4 x 10(15) molec.cm(-2)). For lower columns, OMI observations present a remaining positive bias of about 20% (< 0.8 x 10(15) molec.cm(-2)) compared to TROPOMI in midlatitude regions. Here, we also use a global network of 18 MAX-DOAS (multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy) instruments to validate both satellite sensors for a large range of HCHO columns. This work complements the study by Vigouroux et al. (2020), where a global FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) network is used to validate the TROPOMI HCHO operational product. Consistent with the FTIR validation study, we find that for elevated HCHO columns, TROPOMI data are systematically low (25% for HCHO columns larger than 8 x 10(15) molec.cm(-2)), while no significant bias is found for medium-range column values. We further show that OMI and TROPOMI data present equivalent biases for large HCHO levels. However, TROPOMI significantly improves the precision of the HCHO observations at short temporal scales and for low HCHO columns. We show that compared to OMI, the precision of the TROPOMI HCHO columns is improved by 25% for individual pixels and by up to a factor of 3 when considering daily averages in 20 km radius circles. The validation precision obtained with daily TROPOMI observations is comparable to the one obtained with monthly OMI observations. To illustrate the improved performances of TROPOMI in capturing weak HCHO signals, we present clear detection of HCHO column enhancements related to shipping emissions in the Indian Ocean. This is achieved by averaging data over a much shorter period (3 months) than required with previous sensors (5 years) and opens new perspectives to study shipping emissions of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and related atmospheric chemical interactions.

TI  - Examining land surface temperature and relations with the major air pollutants: A remote sensing research in case of Tehran
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Urban air pollution is a dynamic mixture of Land Surface Temperature (LST), gases, particulate matter with daily and seasonal changes due to anthropogenic activities, Land-use Land-cover (LULC) transformations, and climatic conditions. The relationship between urban biophysical and thermal conditions, and LULC is generally known; however, the absence of a dense network of land-based meteorological stations is an obstacle to the comparison of LST to Major Air Pollutants (MAP). Method: This research proposes investigation of the relationships between LST derived by Sentinel-3 SLSTR, MAP derived by Sentinel-5 Precursor, and air pollution monitoring system stations in Tehran province, Iran. The method is designed in a moving average model with the use of a Python application programming interface, geographical information system, and remote sensing. Result: The mean concentration of the Particulate Matter (PM), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are mainly in the Tehran metropolis and the core urban area. A negative correlation was noted between the PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and altitude. Additionally, increased altitude negatively affects LST, Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3) values; whereas, CO and O3 have positive correlations with LST, representing the mutual impacts of LST, CO, and O3 values in Tehran province.

TI  - Emerging Mosquito-Borne Viruses Linked to <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>: Global Status and Preventive Strategies
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging mosquito-borne viruses continue to cause serious health problems and economic burden among billions of people living in and near the tropical belt of the world. The highly invasive mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus have successively invaded and expanded their presence as key vectors of Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus, and that has consecutively led to frequent outbreaks of the corresponding viral diseases. Of note, these two mosquito species have gradually adapted to the changing weather and environmental conditions leading to a shift in the epidemiology of the viral diseases, and facilitated their establishment in new ecozones inhabited by immunologically naive human populations. Many abilities of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as vectors of significant arbovirus pathogens, may affect the infection and transmission rates after a bloodmeal, and may influence the vector competence for either virus. We highlight that many collaborating risk factors, for example, the global transportation systems may result in sporadic and more local outbreaks caused by mosquito-borne viruses related to Ae. aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus. Those local outbreaks could in synergy grow and produce larger epidemics with pandemic characters. There is an urgent need for improved surveillance of vector populations, human cases, and reliable prediction models. In summary, we recommend new and innovative strategies for the prevention of these types of infections.

TI  - Analysis of air pollution in the atmosphere due to firecrackers in the Diwali period over an urban Indian region
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Short-term investigations of atmospheric pollutants (PM10, P-2.5,SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO) were performed during the Diwali festival over Varanasi for a period of six years from 2011 to 2016. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observed for the corresponding days of Diwali was found to be considerably much higher and even its value reached 2.0 for some Diwali years, which is basically almost 3-folds than the control days. The total scattering aerosol optical thickness as well as aerosol extinction co-efficient at 550 nm crossed the value of 1.0 in almost all the Diwali day cases. The associated meteorological conditions (low wind speed, declining temperature, lowered night-time boundary layer height, etc.) during the Diwali period leads to the detrimental accumulation of atmospheric pollutants near to the surface layer in Varanasi region. Moreover, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were recorded much higher than the safer limits set by NAAQS for 24-hour mean values throughout the period of study. The concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 crossed beyond the safer limits and crossed 500 mu g/m(3) (in 2015) and 450 mu g/m(3) (in 2016) respectively, which is basically 5-6 times higher than the standard NAAQS limit. In comparison with the trace gases concentrations (e.g. SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO) on control day, it was observed higher on the respective Diwali day. Satellite data derived from MODIS (Aqua and Terra) have also been taken into account to observe and verify the unpropitious effects of fireworks for the chosen case. MODIS true-color images show dense smoke plumes and haze over the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) on Diwali days of 2011-2016 with its continuation in the following days. Proper assessment and regular monitoring is needed in order to mitigate the localized air pollution due to this kind of festival by the local scale authority to the top-level environmentalists.

TI  - Quality analysis of Worldview-4 DSMs generated by least squares matching and semiglobal matching
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the estimation of a dense disparity map from a rectified space-borne stereo image pair and generation of the most qualified digital surface model (DSM), new image matching algorithms are being developed. Our study has two main goals of the DSM quality validation of Worldview-4 (WV-4), which offers the highest ground sampling distance (GSD) (30 cm) of civilian optical space-borne missions together with Worldview-3 (WV-3), and performance comparison of semiglobal matching (SGM) and least squares matching (LSM), two of the most preferred image matching algorithms for space-borne data. In the Istanbul study area with a rough topographic structure, 1 m gridded DSMs were derived from geometrically corrected WV-4 stereo image pairs. The qualities were estimated by well-rounded visual and statistical approaches based on standard deviation and normalized median absolute deviation. In modelto-model comparisons, a very high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) DSM was utilized as the reference model. The results demonstrated that the WV-4 DSM derived by SGM has the standard deviation of +/- 0.51 m (1.7 GSD) in height in open areas, whereas the LSM DSM has +/- 1.46 m. In addition, the visual quality of SGM is much better than LSM through building description potential. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Toward an Anthropology of "Sustainable Network-Society"
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - What is new in the literature of the social sciences and humanities has been the proliferation of the word "network" to describe contemporary society. Society nowadays is being referred to as a network of relations. Although these descriptions, especially in anthropology, try to reconfigure the modernist distinction between subjects and objects, most of them share the postmodernist aversion to granting any grand narrative or ideal to the network society. The aim of this paper is to give an anthropological perspective on contemporary network theories and to add a new quality of verticality in the architecture of network societies. The paper argues that any worldview that tries to define the contours of society and individuals living in it must provide for a higher ideal or a grand narrative to enable its inhabitants their gradual evolution and progression. The sustainability of any ideology or worldview, this paper argues, comes from this fact of ensuring a continuous and gradual movement to higher dimensions of life.

TI  - On improved nearshore bathymetry estimates from satellites using ensemble and machine learning approaches
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, two popular linear empirical methods viz., log-ratio model (LRM) and log-linear model (LLM) are used to derive water depths in shallow nearshore waters from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images. Based on these empirical models, a multi-scene ensemble and a non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning approaches are applied to improve the accuracies from these traditional methods. In this analysis, firstly the best scene is selected from a set of six Sentinel-2 A&B images using noise-equivalent reflectance NE Delta R-rs (sr(-1)), optimal bands for LRM and LLM are selected using Optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) and by computing Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) between each band respectively. A total of 80% depth data points obtained from JetSki based echo-sounding measurements are used for training and the remaining 20% are used for testing each approach. The overall errors during the test phase for the range of depth 0-12 m are 0.79 m (0.67 m), 0.94 m (0.66 m) and 0.57 m (0.39 m) using traditional empirical LRM (LLM) methods from the best image, empirical-based ensemble and SVR approaches respectively. Irrespective of the approach, the LLM produced smoother and relatively accurate bathymetry as compared to the LRM. The LLM based SVR ML approach provides the best performance over the entire depth range as compared to all the methods considered in this study. Therefore, this method can be used for efficiently estimating nearshore depths and produce updated high-resolution bathymetry maps for many coastal applications. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Productivity losses due to influenza and influenza-like illness in Switzerland: results of the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network in a non-pandemic era
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of influenza and influenza-like illnesses in Switzerland is generally high. Although related direct medical costs can be substantial, especially if hospitalisations occur, several studies suggested that indirect costs due to the loss of productivity may represent an even higher economic burden. The aim of this study was to assess the costs arising from lost productivity due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses in Switzerland.METHODS: Analyses were based on data collected in 2016 and 2017 by the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (SFOPH). The available information covered details on the physicians collecting the data, patients' characteristics, symptoms, treatments, and inability to work (in terms of physician-recorded workdays lost for own sickness or caregiving). The cost of lost productivity, estimated using the human capital approach, was calculated as the number of workdays lost due to influenza-like illnesses multiplied by the mean salary for one working day. Salary differences across sex, age and region were considered. Extrapolation to the national level was performed by adjusting for the size of the Swiss population, the age and sex distribution, the regional distribution, the number of Sentinel general physician contacts and the specialisation of the physician.RESULTS: At the Swiss national level, the estimated total yearly number of cases of inability to work due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses was 101,287 in 2016 and 86,373 in 2017. In subgroups defined by year, gender, region and age class, numbers of cases per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 12 to 2396. The total number of workdays lost in Switzerland, considering degree of employment and visit day, were estimated to be 324,118 in 2016 and 278,121 in 2017. The number of workdays lost was generally higher in men (53.7% of the total in 2016 and 55.6% of the total in 2017) than women. The estimated total costs due to inability to work, calculated using a human capital approach and including the caregiving costs, were CHF 115 million in 2016 and CHF 103 million in 2017, equivalent to CHF 1.4 million per 100,000 inhabitants.CONCLUSION: The costs of lost productivity due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses in Switzerland are substantial and may vary considerably between different years, regions and age classes. As the present analyses could not consider all causes of lost productivity (e.g., short-term inability to work not requiring a physician consultation, hospitalisations, early retirement, premature death), the total indirect costs due to influenza or influenza-like illnesses can be expected to be higher than the presented estimates.

TI  - The Heteronormativity Theory of Low Sexual Desire in Women Partnered with Men
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Low sexual desire in women partnered with men is typically presumed to be a problem-one that exists in women and encourages a research agenda on causation and treatment targeting women. In this paper, we present a distinct way forward for research on low sexual desire in women partnered with men that attends to a more structural explanation: heteronormativity. A heteronormative worldview assumes that relationships and structures are heterosexual, gender (usually conflated with sex) is binary and complementary, and gender roles fit within narrow bounds including nurturant labor for women. We propose the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men, arguing that heteronormative gender inequities are contributing factors. We outline four hypotheses and their predictions related to: inequitable divisions of household labor, blurring of partner and mother roles, objectification of women, and gender norms surrounding sexual initiation. We discuss some mechanisms-social, physiological, and otherwise-for the heteronormativity theory, especially related to stress, objectification, and nurturance. We close by noting some limitations of our paper and the ways that the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men provides a rigorous, generative, and empirical way forward.

TI  - Research advances in remote sensing monitoring of sea ice in the Bohai sea
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - As a key marine economic zone of China, human social and economic activities are very frequent in the Bohai Sea. The timely acquisition of sea ice parameters is of great significance for the prevention and mitigation of sea ice disasters, the utilization of sea ice re-sources, and the design of marine projects in the Bohai Sea. In current, the remote sensing technology has become the most dominant approach of sea ice monitoring. After years of development, sea ice monitoring of Bohai has formed its regional monitoring mode. On the basis of above, literatures related to remote sensing monitoring of sea ice in Bohai were searched and analyzed, and the research advances were summarized. Then the typical characteristics of remote sensing monitoring of sea ice in the Bohai Sea over the past 30 years are obtained. Based on the current status including diverse monitoring requirements, diverse remote sensing methods, and the development of remote sensing technologies, the future research work of sea ice remote sensing monitoring in the Bohai Sea is prospected, in order to provide some ideas for the follow-up research in this field.

TI  - Analysis of long-term (2002-2020) trends and peak events in total suspended solids concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay using MODIS imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality monitoring programs have been widely implemented worldwide to monitor and assess water quality and to understand its trends. However, water quality analysis based on point-source field observations is difficult to perform at large spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, a fully automated Google Earth Engine (GEE) application algorithm was developed to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration in the Chesapeake Bay based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra imagery. Combining long-term archived satellite data (2002-2020) with field observations, the concentrations and spatiotemporal patterns of TSS in the bay water were evaluated. Time series analysis showed a statistically significant decreasing trend in TSS concentration between 2002 and 2020, suggesting that the sediment concentration in the bay has gradually been decreasing over the last two decades. The decreasing trend was observed in 49 out of 60 segments of the bay, implying that substantial progress has been made toward attaining the Chesapeake Bay water quality standards. Based on the monthly TSS analysis, 12 major peak events of TSS were identified in the Chesapeake Bay, which coincided with extreme winter blizzards and summer hurricane events. The GEE application and the results presented herein complement the existing monitoring program in attaining the water quality standards of the bay.

TI  - Recurrence risk of occult micrometastases and isolated tumor cells in early stage endometrial cancer: A case control study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To determine whether previously undetected occult micrometastasis (MM) or isolated tumor cells (ITC) is associated with increased recurrence odds in stage I-II endometrioid adenocarcinoma.Methods: Women with recurrent stage I/II EC who had complete pelvic and para-aortic were identified as the outcome of interest. A case-control study was designed with the exposure defined as occult MM/ITC not seen on original nodal pathology. Controls were found by frequency-matching in a 1:2 case control ratio. Original nodal slides were re-reviewed, stained and tested with immunohistochemical to detect occult MM/ITC and the odds of associated recurrence was calculated.Results: Of 153 included, 50 with and 103 without recurrence, there was no difference in age (p = 0.46), race (p = 0.24), stage (p = 0.75), FIGO grade (p = 0.64), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI); p = 1.00, or GOG 99 high-intermediate risk (HIR) criteria (p = 0.35). A total of 18 ITC (11.8%) and 3 MM (2.0%) not previously identified were found in 19 patients. Finding occult MM/ITC was not associated with more lymph nodes (LN) removed (p = 0.67) or tumor grade (p = 0.48) but was significantly associated with stage (p < 0.01). LVSI (p = 0.09) and meeting high-intermediate risk criteria (p = 0.09), were closely associated but not statistically significant. Isolated ITC were not associated with increased odds for recurrence (OR 0.71, CL: 0.20 - 2.22, p = 0.57), recurrence free survival (RFS) (p = 0.85) or overall survival (OS) (p = 0.92).Conclusions: In early-stage EC, identification of occult MM or ITC is uncommon and associated with stage. The presence of ITC was not associated with increased odds of recurrence. Adjusting stage or treatment may avoided based on ITC alone. Isolated MM were rare in our population, and further investigation is warranted.

TI  - Dismantling the sacred in the name of humanity: Mahmud Muhammad Taha's cultural revolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sudanese thinker Mahmud Muhammad Taha (d. 1985) was a bold advocate of Arab enlightenment, which he based on a synthesis of Sufism, democracy and socialism that in his view represented the ideal amalgamation of ethics, freedom, and equality. The model of Islam he sought to renew was the Islam of Mecca (612-622). In his view, the Meccan period advocated universal values such as justice, freedom and peace, and ought hence be revived. The Medinan period (622-632), which turned Islam into a religion of coercion and exploitation, needed to be abolished. Taha's sharp division of the Qur'an into two parts, one exalted and the other inferior, signified a total break with past legacies. His dismantling of the sacred in the name of humanity was intertwined with his deconstruction of Arab collective memory regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict, as he called for reconciliation with the Jewish State. While Taha's vigorous writing rocked Islamic and Arabic scholarship, it left him and his followers on the fringes of consensus. This study opens a wider window onto the worldview of one of the most creative, and controversial, Arab thinkers in modern times - as yet not thoroughly researched - while framing him within a broader discussion of Arab liberalism.

TI  - Mapping smallholder forest plantations in Andhra Pradesh, India using multitemporal harmonized landsat sentinel-2 S10 data
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study's objective was to develop a method by which smallholder forest plantations can be mapped accurately in Andhra Pradesh, India, using multitemporal visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands from the sentinel-2 multispectral instruments (MSIs). Conversion to cropland, coupled with secondary dependencies on and scarcity of wood products, has driven the deforestation and degradation of natural forests in Southeast Asia. Concomitantly, forest plantations have been established both within and outside of forests, with the latter (as contiguous blocks) and are the focus of this study. Accurately mapping smallholder forest plantations in South and Southeast Asia is difficult using remotely sensed data due to the plantations' small size (average of 2 hectares), short rotation ages (4-7 years for timber species), and spectral similarities to croplands and natural forests. Cloud-free Harmonized landsat sentinel-2 (HLS) S10 data were acquired over six dates, from different seasons, over four years (2015-2018). Available in situ data on forest plantations was supplemented with additional training data resulting in 2230 high-quality samples aggregated into three land cover classes: nonforest, natural forest, and forest plantations. Image classification used random forests on a thirty-band stack consisting of the VNIR bands and NDVI images for all six dates. The median classification accuracy from the 5-fold cross-validation was 94.3%. Our results, predicated on high-quality training data, demonstrate that (mostly smallholder) forest plantations can be separated from natural forests even using only the sentinel-2 VNIR bands when multitemporal data (across both years and seasons) are used.

TI  - Fine scale optical remote sensing experiment of mixed stand over complex terrain (FOREST) in the Genhe Reserve Area: objective, observation and a case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing allows to efficiently monitor forest ecosystems at regional and global scales. However, most of the widely used optical forward models and backward estimation methods are only suitable for forest canopies in flat areas. To evaluate the recent progress in forest remote sensing over complex terrain, a satellite-airborne-ground synchronous Fine scale Optical Remote sensing Experiment of mixed Stand over complex Terrain (FOREST) was conducted over a 1 kmx1 km key experiment area (KEA) located in the Genhe Reserve Areain 2016. Twenty 30 mx30 m elementary sampling units (ESUs) were established to represent the spatiotemporal variations of the KEA. Structural and spectral parameters were simultaneously measured for each ESU. As a case study, we first built two 3D scenes of the KEA with individual-tree and voxel-based approaches, and then simulated the canopy reflectance using the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework over heterogeneous 3D scenes (LESS). The correlation coefficient between the LESS-simulated reflectance and the airborne-measured reflectance reaches 0.68-0.73 in the red band and 0.56-0.59 in the near-infrared band, indicating a good quality of the experiment dataset. More validation studies of the related forward models and retrieval methods will be done.

TI  - Glacier surface velocities in the Jankar Chhu Watershed, western Himalaya, India: Study using Landsat time series data (1992-2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a spatial and temporal surface velocity analysis of 33 glaciers in the Jankar Chhu Watershed (JCW), western Himalaya. The surface velocity was computed using the Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) tool on the Landsat images spanning nearly three decades (1992-2020). Long-term (1948-2018) inter-annual and seasonal climatic trends are also evaluated based on the US NCEP/NCAR reanalyzed gridded data. The role of several topographic and climatic parameters was examined to characterize heterogeneity in velocity.Glaciers in the JCW exhibit three distinct spatial velocity patterns. The type-I glaciers show nearly stagnant (<5 m yr(-1)) debris-covered tongues but a maximum velocity of >60 m yr(-1) in the debris-free accumulation area. The type-II glaciers exhibit active tongues (>50 m yr(-1)) yet have slow movement in the accumulation zone. The type-III glaciers show prolonged (<10 m yr(-1)) yet consistent movement throughout the flow line. Results show that the average surface velocity of studied glaciers was 11.10 +/- 4.1 m yr(-1) in 1992/93, which increased (by-43%) to 15.87 +/- 2.4 m yr(-1) in 2000/02 and further increased (by-59%) to 25.25 +/- 1.5 m yr(-1) in 2017/18. Glaciers show seasonal fluctuations in surface velocities with an apparent "summer speedup" of-19%-200% compared to the winter velocities. Inter-annual velocities show an increasing trend during the observation periods. Analysis of NCEP/NCAR gridded data also reveals that the temperature increased by 0.55 degrees C while precipitation decreased by 0.73 mm during 1948-2018.Our results indicate that glaciers remain dynamic throughout their length with systematic spatiotemporal variations in surface velocity that points towards the control of several topographical and morphological factors. The spatially heterogeneous pattern in surface velocity is characterized by zones of high activity crevasses with steep gradients (>30 degrees) showing maximum ice movement at higher elevations, while debris-covered tongues in the low elevations having gentle slopes (<2 degrees) are nearly stagnant. Based on our results and evidences from the literatures, we suggest that seasonal variations (i.e., summer speedup) in surface velocity in the JCW are due to seasonal temperature fluctuations that alter meltwater availability to the subglacial processes akin to the other Himalaya glaciers. An increasing trend in annual velocity manifests the rising trend in temperature in the western Himalaya. Local topographic configuration, combined with regional climatic systems, controls the amount and types of precipitation received in areas like ours to sustain glaciers on a millennial-scale.

TI  - Dimensionality reduction and classification for hyperspectral image based on robust supervised ISOMAP
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study contributes to classification and recognition of hyperspectral image in industrial sorting, mineral identification, geological exploration, environmental survey, and other industrial production fields. The finding eliminates the redundancy of hyperspectral data and improves the classification accuracy of hyperspectral image. Hyperspectral remote sensing data are inherently nonlinear, and traditional linear dimensionality reduction methods cannot effectively reveal the nonlinear structure contained in the data. Manifold learning is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method which has been developed rapidly in recent years. The intrinsic structure of the data is preserved by Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP), but it is sensitive to noise and is not conducive to final classification. Prior studies neglected a higher dimensional manifold real structure in hyperspectral data dimensionality reduction due to lack of consideration credibility information and class information of samples in calculating manifold distance. This study proposes a Robust Supervised ISOMAP method. Data sample credibility mode is constructed, and a data similarity measure named triple geodesic distance is defined by introducing samples' credibility information, class information, and neighborhood information. Triple geodesic distance fitting is proven. Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and generalized regression neural network are used to construct the embedded coordinates of training samples and test samples. The results show that the proposed method has higher anti-noise performance than the traditional one. Also, the runtime is feasible, and can effectively improve the classification precision of the hyperspectral images, in comparison to traditional ISOMAP methods. The conclusion is that Robust Supervised ISOMAP is an effective nonlinear dimensionality reduction method for hyperspectral remote sensing image.

AB  - In 2002 Mauduit and S ' arko center dot zy started to study finite sequences of k symbolsE-N = (e(1), e(2), ... , e(N)) is an element of A(N) ,where A = {a(1), a(2), center dot center dot center dot, a(k)} (k is an element of N, k >= 2) is a finite set of k symbols. Later many pseudorandom sequences of k symbols have been given and studied by using number theoretic methods. In this paper we study the pseudorandom properties of the k-ary Sidel'nikov sequences with length q - 1 by using the estimates for certain character sums with exponential function, where q is a prime power. Our results show that Sidel'nikov sequences enjoy good well distribution measure and correlation measure. Furthermore, we prove that the set of size phi(q - 1) of k-ary Sidel'nikov sequences is collision free and possesses 1 the strict avalanche effect property provided that k = o(q(1/4)), where phi denotes Euler's totient function.

TI  - Biophysical evidence to support and extend the vitamin D-folate hypothesis as a paradigm for the evolution of human skin pigmentation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To test the "vitamin D-folate hypothesis for the evolution of human skin pigmentation." Methods Total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) satellite data were used to examine surface UV-irradiance in a large (n = 649) Australian cross-sectional study population. Genetic analysis was used to score vitamin D- and folate-related gene polymorphisms (n = 22), along with two pigmentation gene variants (IRF4-rs12203592/HERC2-rs12913832). Red cell folate and vitamin D-3 were measured by immunoassay and HPLC, respectively. Results Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and pigmentation genes interact to modify blood vitamin levels; Light skin IRF4-TT genotype has greatest folate loss while light skin HERC2-GG genotype has greatest vitamin D-3 synthesis (reflected in both TOMS and seasonal data). UV-wavelength exhibits a dose-response relationship in folate loss within light skin IRF4-TT genotype (305 > 310 > 324 > 380 nm). Significant vitamin D-3 photosynthesis only occurs within light skin HERC2-GG genotype, and is maximal at 305 nm. Three dietary antioxidants (vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene) interact with UVR and pigmentation genes preventing oxidative loss of labile reduced folate vitamers, with greatest benefit in light skin IRF4-TT subjects. The putative photosensitiser, riboflavin, did not sensitize red cell folate to UVR and actually afforded protection. Four genes (5xSNPs) influenced blood vitamin levels when stratified by pigmentation genotype; MTHFR-rs1801133/rs1801131, TS-rs34489327, CYP24A-rs17216707, and VDR-ApaI-rs7975232. Lightest IRF4-TT/darkest HERC2-AA genotype combination (greatest folate loss/lowest vitamin D-3 synthesis) has 0% occurrence. The opposing, commonest (39%) compound genotype (darkest IRF4-CC/lightest HERC2-GG) permits least folate loss and greatest synthesis of vitamin D-3. Conclusion New biophysical evidence supports the vitamin D-folate hypothesis for evolution of skin pigmentation.

TI  - Discrimination of multi-crop scenarios with polarimetric SAR data using Wishart mixture model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrimination of crop varieties spanned over heterogeneous agriculture land is a vital application of polarimetric SAR images for agriculture monitoring and assessment. The covariance matrix of polarimetric SAR images is observed to follow a complex Wishart distribution for major classification tasks. It is true for homogeneous regions, but for heterogeneous regions, the covariance matrix follows a mixture of multiple Wishart distributions. We aim to improve the classification accuracy when the terrain under observation is heterogeneous. For this purpose, Wishart mixture model is employed along with expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. Elbow method helps us to devise the number of mixtures. The convergence of the EM algorithm depends on the choice of initial points. So, to improve the robustness of the model, different initialization approaches, such as random, K-means, and global K-means, are embedded in the EM algorithm. Further, the degrees of freedom is one of the crucial parameters of Wishart distribution. Therefore, the impact of different degrees of freedom is analyzed on classification accuracy. The method that is equipped with initialization technique along with optimum degrees of freedom is assessed using three full polarimetric SAR data sets of agriculture lands. The first two are benchmark data sets of Flevoland, Netherlands, region acquired by AIRSAR sensor, and third is our study area of Mysore, India, acquired by RADARSAT-2 sensor.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Global Daily Evapotranspiration based on a Surface Energy Balance Method and Reanalysis Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently available evapotranspiration (ET) products have not provided us with an accurate estimation for global irrigated land area. Thermal energy balance (EB) model has the potential to solve this problem. The accurate estimation of aerodynamic resistances is a major complication in most remote sensing ET models. An EB model using a column canopy-air turbulent heat diffusion method was developed to more realistically depict dynamic changes in aerodynamic resistance. In order to estimate global ET and land surface fluxes for all weather conditions, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra land surface temperature fields were combined and a nearest-evaporative-fraction gap-filling method was merged into the EB model. A global ET product covering the period 2003-2017 was produced using the EB model. By combining thermal and optional information from MODIS satellites and surface meteorological forcing data from ERA-Interim reanalysis data, the EB model provides a 5 x 5 km resolution estimate of daily ET without spatio-temporal gaps at the global scale. Assessment of the daily EB ET at 238 flux sites showed a mean bias of 0.05 mm/day and an RMSE of 1.56 mm/day. Analysis of global precipitation minus ET demonstrated that EB ET has a relatively higher potential for agriculture water resource management than currently available global ET products, such as Landflux, GLEAM, MOD16, GLDAS, and ERA-Interim ET. In addition, the EB model developed in this study can be applied to both polar and geostationary satellite thermal sensors.Plain Language Summary A new global evapotranspiration (ET) product was derived from satellite data using an energy balance (EB) model. The product has a daily scale and at a high spatial resolution (5 km for a global scale) for 2003-2017, which is particularly useful for agricultural studies. The model makes use of satellite remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and roughness length to calculate instantaneous sensible and latent heat fluxes. These instantaneous fluxes were further used to estimate daily ET. To provide a spatially and temporally continuous map of daily ET globally, two gap-filling methods were employed to correct for the gaps in LST and evaporative fraction products under cloudy sky conditions. The daily ET product has been successfully evaluated with ground based flux tower data. The global ET dataset has a relatively higher potential for agriculture water resource management than currently available global ET products. In addition, the EB model developed in this study can be applied to other polar and geostationary satellites.

TI  - Experimental and model-based investigation of the links between snow bidirectional reflectance and snow microstructure
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow stands out from materials at the Earth's surface owing to its unique optical properties. Snow optical properties are sensitive to the snow microstructure, triggering potent climate feedbacks. The impacts of snow microstructure on its optical properties such as reflectance are, to date, only partially understood. However, precise modelling of snow reflectance, particularly bidirectional reflectance, are required in many problems, e.g. to correctly process satellite data over snow-covered areas. This study presents a dataset that combines bidirectional reflectance measurements over 500-2500 nm and the X-ray tomography of the snow microstructure for three snow samples of two different morphological types. The dataset is used to evaluate the stereological approach from Malinka (2014) that relates snow optical properties to the chord length distribution in the snow microstructure. The mean chord length and specific surface area (SSA) retrieved with this approach from the albedo spectrum and those measured by the X-ray tomography are in excellent agreement. The analysis of the 3D images has shown that the random chords of the ice phase obey the gamma distribution with the shape parameter m taking the value approximately equal to or a little greater than 2. For weak and intermediate absorption (high and medium albedo), the simulated bidirectional reflectances reproduce the measured ones accurately but tend to slightly overestimate the anisotropy of the radiation. For such absorptions the use of the exponential law for the ice chord length distribution instead of the one measured with the X-ray tomography does not affect the simulated reflectance. In contrast, under high absorption (albedo of a few percent), snow microstructure and especially facet orientation at the surface play a significant role in the reflectance, particularly at oblique viewing and incidence.

TI  - Evaluating a prediction system for snow management
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of snowpack models capable of accounting for snow management in ski resorts is a major step towards acceptance of such models in supporting the daily decision-making process of snow production managers. In the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 (H2020) project PROSNOW, a service to enable real-time optimization of grooming and snow-making in ski resorts was developed. We applied snow management strategies integrated in the snowpack simulations of AMUNDSEN, Crocus, and SNOWPACK-Alpine3D for nine PROSNOW ski resorts located in the European Alps. We assessed the performance of the snow simulations for five winter seasons (2015-2020) using both ground-based data (GNSS-measured snow depth) and spaceborne snow maps (Copernicus Sentinel-2). Particular attention has been devoted to characterizing the spatial performance of the simulated piste snow management at a resolution of 10 m. The simulated results showed a high overall accuracy of more than 80% for snow-covered areas compared to the Sentinel-2 data. Moreover, the correlation to the ground observation data was high. Potential sources for local differences in the snow depth between the simulations and the measurements are mainly the impact of snow redistribution by skiers; compensation of uneven terrain when grooming; or spontaneous local adaptions of the snow management, which were not reflected in the simulations. Subdividing each individual ski resort into differently sized ski resort reference units (SRUs) based on topography showed a slight decrease in mean deviation. Although this work shows plausible and robust results on the ski slope scale by all three snowpack models, the accuracy of the results is mainly dependent on the detailed representation of the real-world snow management practices in the models. As snow management assessment and prediction systems get integrated into the workflow of resort managers, the formulation of snow management can be refined in the future.

TI  - Spatial and dietary sources of elevated mercury exposure in white-tailed eagle nestlings in an Arctic freshwater environment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced mercury (Hg) contamination is of global concern and its effects on wildlife remain of high concern, especially in environmental hotspots such as inland aquatic ecosystems. Mercury biomagnifies through the food web resulting in high exposure in apex predators, such as the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), making them excellent sentinel species for environmental Hg contamination. An expanding population of white-tailed eagles is inhabiting a sparsely populated inland area in Lapland, northern Finland, mainly around two large reservoirs flooded 50 years ago. As previous preliminary work revealed elevated Hg levels in this population, we measured Hg exposure along with dietary proxies (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in body feathers collected from white-tailed eagle nestlings in this area between 2007 and 2018. Mercury concentrations were investigated in relation to territory characteristics, proximity to the reservoirs and dietary ecology as potential driving factors of Hg contamination. Mercury concentrations in the nestlings (4.97-31.02 mu g g(-1) dw) were elevated, compared to earlier reported values in nestlings from the Finnish Baltic coast, and exceeded normal background levels (<= 5.00 mu g g(-1)) while remaining below the tentative threshold of elevated risk for Hg exposure mediated health effect (>40.00 mu g g(-1)). The main drivers of Hg contamination were trophic position (proxied by delta N-15), the dietary proportion of the predatory fish pike (Esox Lucius), and the vicinity to the Porttipahta reservoir. We also identified a potential evolutionary trap, as increased intake of the preferred prey, pike, increases exposure. All in all, we present results for poorly understood freshwater lake environments and show that more efforts should be dedicated to further unravel potentially complex pathways of Hg exposure to wildlife.

TI  - Recent trends in the fire dynamics in Brazilian Legal Amazon: Interaction between the ENSO phenomenon, climate and land use
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Legal Amazon is an extensive territory (5,088,668.25 km(2)) in which different factors (environmental and social) influence the fire dynamics of the region. This study aims to explain the seasonal patterns of meteorological variables, fire, land use, and carbon emissions and their inter-relationships, focusing on years of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurrence. For this purpose, we used data from fire foci and burned area obtained by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor and meteorological variables from Reanalysis 2. The kernel density was applied to the fire foci, and Spearman correlation coefficient between the foci and the other variables (fire foci, burned area, carbon emissions, evapotranspiration, wind speed, relative air humidity, rainfall, soil moisture, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean air temperature) and Mann Kendall test for soybean, corn and sugarcane crops were performed. The years considered as La Nina were those with the highest fire foci, burned area, and carbon emissions. Our results show that even in periods considered as low fire risk, forests may be vulnerable to fires due to interaction with other variables. Furthermore, we found a tendency to increase the area planted with soybean, maize, and sugarcane, which may lead to more deforested areas in the region if there is no support from public policies. The uncertainty of the Legal Amazon's behavior towards climate change, combined with possible setbacks in Brazilian environmental policy due to the current government, highlights the importance of studies that encompass several factors such as this one.

TI  - Using time series InSAR to assess the deformation activity of open-pit mine dump site in severe cold area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose There are a large number of open-pit coal mines in the world, and their dependent, heterogeneous dump sites are one of the world's largest chronic waste concerns. The long-term existence of dumps is vulnerable to non-uniform deformation and erosion simultaneously, seriously threatening also the surrounding geological and ecological security. Hence, it is critical to monitor the potential geologic hazards erosion activity of such a large, unstable accumulation. Materials and methods In this study, topographic observations were performed using the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode of the up-to-date high-quality synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1B (S-1B) satellite, while unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric data were used to assist in phase unwrapping, showing the deformation and soil erosion of the Baorixile open-pit coal mine dump in China from September 2016 to September 2019. At the same time, the possible areas of geological disasters were predicted, and the formation mechanism of different types of erosion was analyzed. Results and discussion The validation indicates that the deformation monitoring results by S-1B data matched well with the measured value. The soil consolidation has a positive effect on improving dump geological stability, while soil erosion has the opposite effect. The high correlation between accumulation consolidation and stacking height was used to distinguish soil consolidation and soil erosion from total deformation. The dump has undergone subsidence and/or erosion under gravity and non-gravity factors. The overall cumulative vertical subsidence and slope deformation ranged from 12 to - 298 mm (negative values indicate that the target moved away from the sensor) and from 4 to 365 mm, respectively. The deformation was aggravated with the increase of the stacking height of the dump site, especially at the edge of the top area. Soil erosion and slope instability were the results of the combined action of multiple factors, such as spring snowmelt erosion, summer (rainy season) surface runoff erosion and internal seepage erosion, autumn wind erosion, and winter frost heaving erosion. Potential slope destabilization hazards and hidden danger areas of slope instability need continuous attention. Conclusion In summary, the deformation analysis suggests that the collaborative application of S-1B SAR image and UAV photogrammetric data demonstrates the practicability of the fine deformation monitoring service in the dump site and can be a useful tool for long-term continuous deformation and soil erosion monitoring.

TI  - Overcoming the challenge of those new with SSM in surfacing relevant worldviews for action to improve
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soft systems methodology (SSM) has become a broadly used and hands-on approach to systems thinking. Flexibility has been a key to the increasing use of SSM in both study and practice. Such flexibility is not necessarily good news for those who are unfamiliar with SSM. In some instances, SSM users face significant challenges when progressing from the early stage of finding out the problematic situation to crafting the purposeful activity model. The stumbling factor often involves the crucial step of the emergence of different relevant worldviews. Failing to capture relevant worldviews just in time will result in difficulty formulating accommodative action to improve. In such a case, the SSM result can be unsatisfactory. To address this issue, we propose using the 7-S framework as an auxiliary tool assisting those new with SSM in emerging relevant worldviews for action to improve in a time-constrained situation.

TI  - Novel approach to large-scale monitoring of submerged aquatic vegetation: A nationwide example from Sweden
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the EU Habitats directive, the Water Framework Directive, and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, member states are required to map, monitor, and evaluate changes in quality and areal distribution of different marine habitats and biotopes to protect the marine environment more effectively. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a key indicator of the ecological status of coastal ecosystems and is therefore widely used in reporting related to these directives. Environmental monitoring of the areal distribution of SAV is lacking in Sweden due to the challenges of large-scale monitoring using traditional small-scale methods. To address this gap, in 2020, we embarked on a project to combine Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, novel machine learning (ML) techniques, and advanced data processing in a cloud-based web application that enables users to create up-to-date SAV classifications. At the same time, the approach was used to derive the first high-resolution SAV map for the entire coastline of Sweden, where an area of 1550 km2 was mapped as SAV. Quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the classification using independent field data from three different regions along the Swedish coast demonstrated relative high accuracy within shallower areas, particularly where water transparency was high (average total accuracy per region 0.60-0.77). However, the classification missed large proportions of vegetation growing in deeper water (on average 31%-50%) and performed poorly in areas with fragmented or mixed vegetation and poor water quality, challenges that should be addressed in the development of the mapping methods towards integration into monitoring frameworks such as the EU directives. In this article, we present the results of the first satellite-derived SAV classification for the entire Swedish coast and show the implementation of a cloud-based SAV mapping application (prototype) developed within the frame of the project.

TI  - MOSAiC drift expedition from October 2019 to July 2020: sea ice conditions from space and comparison with previous years
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We combine satellite data products to provide a first and general overview of the physical sea ice conditions along the drift of the international Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition and a comparison with previous years (2005-2006 to 2018-2019). We find that the MOSAiC drift was around 20% faster than the climatological mean drift, as a consequence of large-scale low-pressure anomalies prevailing around the Barents-Kara-Laptev sea region between January and March. In winter (October-April), satellite observations show that the sea ice in the vicinity of the Central Observatory (CO; 50 km radius) was rather thin compared to the previous years along the same trajectory. Unlike ice thickness, satellite-derived sea ice concentration, lead frequency and snow thickness during winter months were close to the long-term mean with little variability. With the onset of spring and decreasing distance to the Fram Strait, variability in ice concentration and lead activity increased. In addition, the frequency and strength of deformation events (divergence, convergence and shear) were higher during summer than during winter. Overall, we find that sea ice conditions observed within 5 km distance of the CO are representative for the wider (50 and 100 km) surroundings. An exception is the ice thickness; here we find that sea ice within 50 km radius of the CO was thinner than sea ice within a 100 km radius by a small but consistent factor (4 %) for successive monthly averages. Moreover, satellite acquisitions indicate that the formation of large melt ponds began earlier on the MOSAiC floe than on neighbouring floes.

TI  - Transnational cultures of Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean, and Philippine national cinema
T2  - TRANSNATIONAL SCREENS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a transnational structure for the examination of films from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines based on the concept of Nusantara as a region characterised by a shared worldview, values, and principles. Particular attention is paid to how films from these countries can be studied based on representation through the use of regional themes and cultural codes. Additionally, this article also examines 'cultural identity' from shared history and ancestry, something which the cinemas of the four nations and the surrounding populations have in common. And, rather than just seeing films through the national lens it suggests that 'critical transnationalism' justifies looking at how the people of these countries view themselves through film representations and determines how to connect them. There are three themes that may provide an answer to the question of shared cultural identities in films of these countries, first, the concept of 'tanahair' which in Malay means 'homeland', second, the distinctive regional form of mobility called 'merantau' (to go on a journey, to wander) and, third, the degree of ambiguity and perplexity among the inhabitants of borderlands in films. This research found that 'critical transnationalism' is a reliable way to avoid the constraint of state-centrism in the discussion of films from these Southeast Asian countries.

TI  - Spatial analysis of factors influencing land subsidence using the OLS Model (Case Study: Fahlian Aquifer)
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past years, land subsidence due to different reasons such as uncontrolled population growth, overuse of groundwater resources, tectonic and other factors has led to numerous challenges and problems for agricultural lands, residential buildings, roads, power transmission lines, etc. Hence, it is important to monitor the rate of subsidence and address its influencing cause or causes to control and monitor risk. Sentinel-1A data were used in Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) in this study to examine the subsidence status in the Fahlian aquifer and determine the changes in the land surface in the specified time period. Grace satellite was also used to monitor the changes in the aquifer groundwater fluctuations. OLS model was used to perform spatial analysis of parameters influencing subsidence, the results of which indicated several influencing factors. Accordingly, the greatest impact on land subsidence was related to groundwater drawdown, altitude, and vegetation with probabilities of 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001%, respectively, indicating the significance of the mentioned parameters in the subsidence of the Fahlian aquifer. The output of the CSR, JPL, and CFZ algorithms showed a drawdown trend for the groundwater level since 2009, reaching about 20 cm in 2017.

TI  - The value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound enhancement patterns for the diagnosis of sentinel lymph node status in breast cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The sentinel lymph node (SLN) can represent the metastasis status of axillary lymph nodes and is a prognostic factor of breast cancer. Preoperative imaging provides information for axillary surgery decision-making, and this meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for SLN status in breast cancer patients.Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Clinical Trails gov. and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until 31 March 2020. Two review authors independently screened and selected the relevant studies and extracted data, and the assessment of the methodological quality of studies was according to the QUADAS-2 tool. The diagnostic value of CEUS was assessed by calculating the pooled sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio, and a summary receiver operating characteristic curve and hierarchical modeling method was used to conduct the meta-analysis.Results: Five studies with 771 breast cancer patients were included, and the results showed CEUS could provide additional information for SLN preoperative diagnosis. A homogeneous or uniform enhancement pattern suggested a benign lymph node, and a heterogeneous, no pattern, or weak enhancement pattern suggested a node was malignant, demonstrating high sensitivity of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.856, 0.989) and moderate specificity of 0.807 (0.581, 0.926). The pooled positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were 4.987 (2.104, 11.822) and 0.049 (0.014, 0.168), and 101.294 (31.202, 328.837), respectively.Conclusions: A homogeneous enhancement pattern was highly suggestive of benign lymph nodes with high sensitivity. CEUS could effectively identify the SLN, and facilitate the diagnosis of its metastatic status.

TI  - Drivers of recent forest cover change in southern South America are linked to climate and CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - and background Widespread changes in forest structure and distribution have been documented in northern Patagonia over the past century. We employed LPJ-GUESS, a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to investigate the role of climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and fire on simulated forest cover during the twentieth century. Our objective was to assess the drivers responsible for forest change to temperature, precipitation, radiation, fire and atmospheric CO2 Results Simulations using observed changes in climate and CO2 from 1930 to 2010, showed an increase in forest cover under changing climate and CO2, because of higher carbon assimilation and net primary production. The model results were compared with a remote-sensing-derived biomass map and 'greening' indices from the normalized difference vegetation index. Model simulations and satellite data both show increased greening at high and low elevations. In contrast, simulations using pre-industrial climate and CO2 conditions resulted in a decrease in fire frequency and lower simulated biomass than is reflected by present-day vegetation. Conclusion Our simulations shows that climate is the primary driver and CO2 fertilization is the secondary driver of forest expansion in northern Patagonia. We suggest that rising CO2 mitigates climate-induced drought stress due to increases in water-use efficiency.

TI  - Acute encephalitis in pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To characterize neurological involvement in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical, electroencephalographic, CSF and neuroradiological parameters recorded in seven children (3 males, aged 3-10 years) affected by MIS-C with acute neurological involvement. Results: All cases presented acute encephalopathy with drowsiness, irritability, mood deflection and diffuse EEG slowing with periodic posterior complexes. Focal neurological signs, normal brain MRI and CSF, were present in four patients; these patients received intravenous methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/ day for 3 days. In all cases, the clinical picture rapidly improved in the first three days, and all neurological symptoms and EEG abnormalities disappeared within 10 and 30 days respectively. The severity and duration of the EEG abnormalities was proportional to the extent of the neurological involvement. Conclusions: Patients with MIS-C may present acute encephalitis characterized by rapid-onset encephalopathy and EEG abnormalities (slow wave activity and/or epileptic abnormalities), in some cases associated with focal neurological signs that disappear with immunomodulatory therapy. The detection through neurological evaluation of sentinel neurological signs and distinctive EEG patterns documentable at disease onset will allow timely diagnosis and treatment of these cases.

TI  - In-flight radiometric and polarimetric calibration of the Directional Polarimetric Camera onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite over the ocean
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) is the first Chinese multi-angle polarized Earth observation satellite sensor, which was successfully launched on 9 May 2018, onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite in the Chinese High-Resolution Earth Observation Program. The DPC's observation is one of the most important space-borne multi-spectral, multi-angular polarimetric measurements of the global Earth-atmosphere system at the present stage. Although rigorous radiometric calibration had been performed for the DPC before launch, its in-flight performance may change because of the process of launch, harsh environment of space, and aging of the sensor. Due to the absence of the onboard calibration system, vicarious calibration methods are necessary for the DPC's in-flight performance monitoring and calibration. In this paper, we adapted the Rayleigh absolute calibration method, the sun glint inter-band calibration method, and the sun glint polarization calibration method to the DPC sensor. First, the calibration errors of these three methods caused by ancillary data uncertainties (e.g., aerosol, chlorophyll concentration, absorption gases amount, and wind speed) were analyzed in detail. The error budgets show that the aerosol parameters (optical thickness and aerosol model) are some of the critical factors affecting both the radiometric and polarimetric calibration accuracies for the Rayleigh and sun glint methods. The DPC radiometric and polarimetric in-flight calibration during its commissioning phase was then implemented. The absolute coefficients of short spectral bands (443, 490, 565, and 670 nm) were calibrated by the well-characterized Rayleigh scattering signal over the ocean. Using the 565 nm band as a reference band, the Rayleigh absolute calibration was then transferred to other bands (443, 490, 670, and 865 nm) through inter-band calibration using the specular reflection of the sun over the ocean. The polarization measurements of the DPC at polarized bands (490, 670, and 865 nm) were calibrated with the polarized reflection of the sun glint over ocean. The preliminary results show that the radiometric sensitivity of the DPC changed very little after launch at the four visible bands. The absolute calibration coefficient differences from pre-flight calibration are smaller than 0.5% at the 443 and 670 nm bands, while they are within +/- 2% at the 490 and 565 nm bands. However, a large deviation at 865 nm band of about 9% from pre-flight calibration was indicated by the sun glint inter-band calibration. The degree of linear polarization measurement of the DPC is validated with high accuracy of about 0.02 at the 865 nm band, while the deviation at 490 and 670 nm bands are relatively larger, reaching 0.04. The DPC/GaoFen-5 shows a good in-flight performance of radiometric measurement and generally reliable polarimetric measurement after launch. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI  - Assessing urban mortality from wildfires with a citizen science network
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of exposure and mortality attributable to air pollution is one of the most important tasks to inform strategies for mitigation and prevention of the negative effects of degraded air quality. While the vast majority of studies rely on either satellite data or sparse (and expensive) monitoring networks and focus on global- or regional-scale assessments, emerging low-cost citizen science networks are a new source of information that can be used to provide more detailed estimates at urban scale, thereby refining previous estimates and providing spatially resolved information at census tract resolution. In this work, we demonstrate how a citizen science network, validated with a reference air pollution station, provides sensibly different (and spatially resolved) estimates of air pollution levels and associated exposure/mortality than assuming constant air pollution across the analyzed urban area. Specifically we focus on the extreme pollution episode of the 2020 California wildfires that significantly impacted the city of San Francisco. We estimate that during the wildfires, degraded air quality was responsible for an increase between 2 and 4% of the baseline mortality in the same city over the time period of study (August 19, 2020 to September 30, 2020).

TI  - The distribution and evolution of supraglacial lakes on 79° N Glacier (north-eastern Greenland) and interannual climatic controls
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier (also known as the 79 degrees North Glacier) drains approximately 8% of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Supraglacial lakes (SGLs), or surface melt ponds, are a persistent summertime feature and are thought to drain rapidly to the base of the glacier and influence seasonal ice velocity. However, seasonal development and spatial distribution of SGLs in the north-east of Greenland are poorly understood, leaving a substantial error in the estimate of meltwater and its impacts on ice velocity. Using results from an automated detection of melt ponds, atmospheric and surface mass balance modelling, and reanalysis products, we investigate the role of specific climatic conditions in melt onset, extent, and duration from 2016 to 2019. The summers of 2016 and 2019 were characterised by above-average air temperatures, particularly in June, as well as a number of rainfall events, which led to extensive melt ponds to elevations up to 1600 m. Conversely, 2018 was particularly cold, with a large accumulated snowpack, which limited the development of lakes to altitudes less than 800 m. There is evidence of inland expansion and increases in the total area of lakes compared to the early 2000s, as projected by future global warming scenarios.

TI  - Elevation-dependent response of snow phenology to climate change from a remote sensing perspective: A case survey in the central Tianshan mountains from 2000 to 2019
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine snow is an important water resource in arid/semi-arid regions and sensitive to climate change. However, the response of snow phenology to climate change in different elevations remains unclear in mountain areas because of limited observation stations. In this study, the vertical difference of snow phenology and its response to climate change in high mountains are explored by using multi-source remote sensing data from 2000 to 2019, taking the north slope of Central Tianshan Mountains as the study area. The results show that: (1) The temporal changes of snow cover days (SCD), snow cover onset date (SCOD), and snow cover end date (SCED) in different altitudes are various and contribute to the general change trends of the extended SCD, the advanced SCOD, and the advanced SCED from the hydrological year 2000 to 2018; (2) The snow phenology is significantly related to the changed temperature and/or precipitation in most altitudes, except for the SCD and SCOD in high altitudes, where the large temporal changes of temperature and precipitation lead to the complicated correlations in these altitudes; (3) The altitude threshold of 3600 m is identified to separate the relative importance of temperature and precipitation for SCD and SCOD, where the temperature shows a higher importance than precipitation below the altitude threshold, and neither temperature nor precipitation shows constant higher importance above the altitude threshold. As for SCED, the temperature is consistently more important than precipitation in most altitudes.

TI  - Mapping the occurrence and spatial distribution of noxious weed species with multisource data in degraded grasslands in the Three-River Headwaters Region, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of noxious weed species has long been associated with the degradation of alpine grasslands ecosys-tems. However, traditional in situ-based methods for surveying noxious weed species are generally time con-suming and inefficient over large-scale areas. This paper investigates the possibility of applying multisource data to map the occurrence and spatial distribution of noxious weed species in degraded alpine grasslands in the Three-River Headwaters Region, China. Sentinel-2 image-related vegetation indices (VIs), field sample data and environmental variables were integrated to build a noxious weed species detection model based on the max-imum entropy (MaxEnt) species modeling framework. The modeling results suggest that based on both training and testing AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) values higher than 0.82, the VI-only variable model, the environmental-only variable model and the combined environmental and VI variables model, all yielded good simulation results. The spatial distributions of noxious weed species mapped by the VI-only variable model and the combined environmental and VI variable model were more concentrated, while the VI-only variable model yielded more scattered results. This analysis also explains why noxious weed species are mainly distributed in the low-elevation flat riverine zone in the study area. The model combining Sentinel-2 imagery-related VIs, environmental variables and in situ sample data proposed in this study can successfully map the occurrence and spatial distributions of noxious weed species. The method and results of this research can be used to help monitor noxious weed species invasions and better manage grassland ecosystems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Use of a BP Neural Network and Meteorological Data for Generating Spatiotemporally Continuous LAI Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporally continuous long-term leaf area index (LAI) products are urgently needed to monitor environmental changes. The current filter- or curve-fitting-based time series reconstructive algorithms fail to reconstruct the LAI time series with many continuous missing values or missing values in key phenological periods, which are common issues in high-spatial-resolution LAI time series. In this article, a meteorological data-driven backpropagation neural network (MBPNN) was proposed to reconstruct discontinuous LAI profiles with a two-step process using vegetation phenological information. As the basis of the strong dependence of vegetation growth on meteorological conditions, a reasonable growth trajectory of reconstructed LAI can be guaranteed by the algorithm even though if many observed values are missing. Validations for reconstructed LAI were conducted both spatially and temporally based on reference maps and field-measured long-term observations. The results showed that the LAI predicted by the MBPNN had a similar accuracy (RMSE = 0.4076) as the Landsat LAI inversions (RMSE = 0.4083) and a similar reconstructed trajectory as the field-measured LAI series even though over 100 days of continuous data were missing (RMSE = 0.1620). A comparison with the Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) algorithm showed that the accuracy of MBPNN was more stable regardless of the size/position of the missing data, and the proposed method performed much better when the data were continuously missing for 50 days or more.

TI  - Mapping the stock and spatial distribution of aboveground woody biomass in the native vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado biome
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado biome consists of a highly heterogeneous tropical savanna, and is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. High rates of deforestation, however, place it as the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Brazil. Due to its heterogeneity, biomass and carbon stocks in the Cerrado vegetation are highly variable, and mapping and monitoring these stocks are not a trivial effort. To address this challenge, we built an aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) model for the Cerrado biome using 30-m resolution optical satellite imagery (Landsat-5 and Landsat-8), 25-m resolution SAR imagery (ALOS and ALOS-2), and a set of plot-based and LiDAR-derived AGWB estimates (n = 1858) from a wide network of researchers in Brazil. We implemented both a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to model AGWB over the native vegetation in the year 2019 (as classified by MapBiomas) in the Cerrado. The RF algorithms resulted in a slightly better result (R-2 = 53%; rel. RMSE = 57%) than the CART model (R-2 = 45%; rel. RMSE = 63%), but our map shows an underestimation of very high AGWB (negative bias over 200 t ha(-1)) and a slight overestimation of low AGWB (positive bias), especially in the RF model (bias of 1.19 t ha(-1) against 0.86 t ha(-1) for the CART model). We believe we have contributed to knowledge on the woody biomass stocks in the biome, especially in the predominant savanna woodlands, which is where the highest current rates of conversion take place in the Cerrado.

TI  - LiDAR and multispectral imagery predict the occurrence of tree cavities suitable for a cavity-nesting duck
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree cavities are an essential habitat component for wildlife species across diverse taxa, from insects to large mammals. Many of these species are imperiled by loss of cavities. Further, conservation action is hindered by limited information on the spatial distribution of cavities, largely due to difficulties in developing useful models of their presence or abundance. Accurately predicting the fine-scale, landscape-wide, spatial distribution of these important habitat features would greatly benefit conservation measures. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of using remotely sensed data, including LiDAR, multispectral imagery, and SAR, to predict the locations of cavities suitable for nesting Wood Ducks Aix sponsa at fine scales (<= 40 x 40 m) and across a broad landscape (similar to 254 000 ha). We used Random Forest models to classify the presence-absence of cavities at four spatial scales of prediction (5, 10, 20, and 40-m pixels) as well as three groupings of predictor variables (LiDAR-derived metrics, spatial forest-inventory variables [derived via LiDAR or imagery], and ancillary remotely sensed data [derived via SAR or imagery]), and then compared the accuracy between models. The 20-m response-scale had the highest accuracy. Variables from each of the groupings were important and largely relied on multispectral imagery and LiDAR data. Our final model and predictive map had 84% overall Out of Bag accuracy and, when tested with an independent cavity dataset, correctly identified 80% of trees with suitable cavities as presences. The predictive map can be used by researchers and land-managers to determine how past management actions have affected cavity availability as well as the locations of habitat complexes for Wood Ducks and, potentially, other secondary-cavity-nesting wildlife. In addition, our analysis can serve as a methodological case-study for cavity-nesting wildlife in other regions, as the use of remotely sensed data like high-density LiDAR and multispectral imagery increases.

TI  - Snowpack dynamics in the Lebanese mountains from quasi-dynamically downscaled ERAS reanalysis updated by assimilating remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The snowpack over the Mediterranean mountains constitutes a key water resource for the downstream populations. However, its dynamics have not been studied in detail yet in many areas, mostly because of the scarcity of snowpack observations. In this work, we present a characterization of the snowpack over the two mountain ranges of Lebanon. To obtain the necessary snowpack information, we have developed a 1 km regional-scale snow reanalysis (ICAR_assim) covering the period 2010-2017. ICAR_assim was developed by means of an ensemble-based data assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) through an energy and mass snow balance model, the Flexible Snow Model (FSM2), using the particle batch smoother (PBS). The meteorological forcing data were obtained by a regional atmospheric simulation from the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) nested inside a coarser regional simulation from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The boundary and initial conditions of WRF were provided by the ERAS atmospheric reanalysis. ICAR_assim showed very good agreement with MODIS gap-filled snow products, with a spatial correlation of R = 0.98 in the snow probability (P (snow)) and a temporal correlation of R = 0.88 on the day of peak snow water equivalent (SWE). Similarly, ICAR_assim has shown a correlation with the seasonal mean SWE of R = 0.75 compared with in situ observations from automatic weather stations (AWSs). The results highlight the high temporal variability in the snowpack in the Lebanese mountain ranges, with the differences between Mount Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains that cannot only be explained by hypsography as the Anti-Lebanon Mountains are in the rain shadow of Mount Lebanon. The maximum fresh water stored in the snowpack is in the middle elevations, approximately between 2200 and 2500 m a.s.l. (above sea level). Thus, the resilience to further warming is low for the snow water resources of Lebanon due to the proximity of the snowpack to the zero isotherm.

TI  - Tracking changes in the area, thickness, and volume of the Thwaites tabular iceberg "B30" using satellite altimetry and imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Icebergs account for half of all ice loss from Antarctica and, once released, present a hazard to maritime operations. Their melting leads to a redistribution of cold fresh water around the Southern Ocean which, in turn, influences water circulation, promotes sea ice formation, and fosters primary production. In this study, we combine CryoSat-2 satellite altimetry with MODIS and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and meteorological data to track changes in the area, freeboard, thickness, and volume of the B30 tabular iceberg between 2012 and 2018. We track the iceberg elevation when it was attached to Thwaites Glacier and on a further 106 occasions after it calved using Level lb CryoSat data, which ensures that measurements recorded in different acquisition modes and within different geographical zones are consistently processed. From these data, we map the iceberg's freeboard and estimate its thickness taking snowfall and changes in snow and ice density into account. We compute changes in free-board and thickness relative to the initial average for each overpass and compare these to estimates from precisely located tracks using the satellite imagery. This comparison shows good agreement (correlation coefficient 0.87) and suggests that colocation reduces the freeboard uncertainty by 1.6 m. We also demonstrate that the snow layer has a significant impact on iceberg thickness change. Changes in the iceberg area are measured by tracing its perimeter, and we show that alternative estimates based on arc lengths recorded in satellite altimetry profiles and on measurements of the semimajor and semi-minor axes also capture the trend, though with a 48 % overestimate and a 15 % underestimate, respectively. Since it calved, the area of B30 has decreased from 1500 +/- 60 to 426 +/- 27 km(2), its mean freeboard has fallen from 49.0 +/- 4.6 to 38.8 +/- 2.2 m, and its mean thickness has reduced from 315 +/- 36 to 198 +/- 14 m. The combined loss amounts to an 80 % +/- 16 % reduction in volume, two thirds (69 % +/- 14 %) of which is due to fragmentation and the remainder (31 % +/- 11 %) of which is due to basal melting.

TI  - Long time series of daily evapotranspiration in China based on the SEBAL model and multisource images and validation
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) have been widely used for water resources management in China. An accurate ET product with a high spatiotemporal resolution is required for research on drought stress and water resources management. However, such a product is currently lacking. Moreover, the performances of different ET estimation algorithms for China have not been clearly studied, especially under different environmental conditions. Therefore, the aims of this study were as follows: (1) to use multisource images to generate a long-time-series (2001-2018) daily ET product with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); (2) to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the SEBAL ET in China using flux observational data and hydrological observational data; and (3) to compare the performance of the SEBAL ET with the MOD16 ET product at the point scale and basin scale under different environmental conditions in China. At the point scale, both the models performed best in the conditions of forest cover, subtropical zones, hilly terrain, or summer, respectively, and SEBAL performed better in most conditions. In general, the accuracy of the SEBAL ET (rRMSE = 44.91 %) was slightly higher than that of the MOD16 ET (rRMSE = 48.72 %). In the basin-scale validation, both the models performed better than in the point-scale validation, with SEBAL obtaining results superior (rRMSE = 13.57 %) to MOD16 (rRMSE D 32.84 %). Additionally, both the models showed a negative bias, with the bias of the MOD16 ET being higher than that of the SEBAL ET. In the daily-scale validation, the SEBAL ET product showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.92 mmd(-1) and an r value of 0.79. In general, the SEBAL ET product can be used for the qualitative analysis and most quantitative analyses of regional ET. The SEBAL ET product is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4243988 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4896147 (Cheng, 2020a, b). The results of this study can provide a reference for the application of remotely sensed ET products and the improvement of satellite ET observation algorithms.

TI  - Coffee yield estimation by Landsat-8 imagery considering shading effects of planting row's orientation in center pivot
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using spectral information, obtained from orbital sensor systems, combined with spectral indices, it's possible to characterize coffee trees conditions with their intrinsic characteristics, which can improve the imaging accuracy and optimize the crop monitoring tasks. However, within center pivot shape, a circular planting orientation is a feature that can difficult to determine coffee yield through remote sensing, resulting in inaccurate inferences about its spectral signature and its yield correlation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation of different phenological stages spectral responses of coffee, under distinct apparent brightness conditions, with the yield sampled in field. The study was carried out on a center pivot irrigated area, located in Presidente Oleg'ario municipality, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Yield data was obtained of 114 georeferenced sample points. Landsat-8 data, obtained between 05/25/2015 and 06/28/2016, were submitted to statistical analysis of Correlation and Multiple Linear Regression in conjunction with yield data. It was observed that the positional arrangement and the planting orientation significantly interfered in the yield estimation. A brightness difference was observed within the collateral area sectors, which raised the coffee plants spectral complexity. This demanded a conditional approach for data analyses and interpretation processes. Based on results, an evidence of good explanatory and predictive relationship with the coffee yield was found for Landsat-8 images when divergent brightness subsets were evaluated separately, raising the forecast accuracy from spectral data. It was concluded that the coffee phenological stages with the highest yield predictive potential are the "dormant bud" and "lead bead" stages.

TI  - Effects of urbanisation in a shallow coastal aquifer: An integrated GIS-based case study in Cochin, India
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation impacts the availability and quality of renewable natural resources, particularly water resources. In coastal regions, the magnitude of urbanisation and its consequences is more prevalent. However, there are limited quantitative assessments on how urbanisation affects the groundwater system, especially the groundwater potential. Therefore, in the present study, we analysed the variability in groundwater potential zones due to the temporal changes in land use land cover (LULC) for Cochin, Kerala, India. For this, a GIS-based weighted overlay analysis method was performed with six geo-environmental factors to delineate groundwater potential zones (GWPZ). GWPZ at three different decadal time points from 1992 to 2019 was derived using the representative LULC maps. Our analysis showed a significant reduction in the high potential zone, decreasing from 75.34 % to 17.53 %. Contrastingly, the low potential zone rose from 0 to 11.8 % from 1992 to 2019. The temporal change in the spatial pattern in GWPZ named Groundwater Potential Change Index (GWPCI) was derived through pixel-level change detection. We performed a long-term (1985-2017) trend analysis on groundwater levels obtained for a network of twenty-three observation wells from the study area to validate the results. The trend analysis showed that 47 % of the wells display a statistically significant declining water level trend. Subsequently, twelve wells were selected to perform a bivariate statistical analysis between the long-term trend in water level and GWPCI. Ten wells showed a reasonable agreement to the negative change in GWPCI, while two displayed no relation to GWPCI. The study illustrates the effect of LULC change patterns in the groundwater system since significant alterations were observed on GWPZ. The systematic approach adopted in the present study can contribute to sustainable land and water resource management aimed at reducing the urbanisation impact on the groundwater system in the future.

TI  - Estimation of deracinated trees area in temperate forest with satellite images employing machine learning methods
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change can increase the number of uprooted trees. Although there have been an increasing number of machine learning applications for satellite image analysis, the estimation of deracinated tree area by satellite image is not well developed. Therefore, we estimated the deracinated tree area of forests via machine-learning classification using Landsat 8 satellite images. We employed support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RF), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as potential machine learning methods, and tested their performance in estimating the deracinated tree area. We collected satellite images of upright trees, deracinated trees, soil, and others (e.g., waterbodies and cities), and trained them with the training data. We compared the accuracy represented by the correct classification rate of these methods, to determine the deracinated tree area. It was found that the SVM and RF performed better than the CNN for two-class classification (deracinated and upright trees), and the correct classification rates of all methods were up to 93%. We found that the CNN and RF performed significantly higher for the four- and twoclass classification compared to the other methods, respectively. We conclude that the CNN is useful for estimating deracinated tree areas using Landsat 8 satellite images.

TI  - Improving forest above ground biomass estimates over Indian forests using multi source data sets with machine learning algorithm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of spatial above ground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests are important in understanding the global carbon cycle. Microwave and optical remote sensing datasets have been used extensively for AGB estimation, but their uses are restricted due to saturation in high biomass region. To overcome saturation issues of single sensor based models, the current paper uses a non-parametric Random Forest based approach to spatially estimate biomass over Indian forests using field inventory data in combination with optical (MODIS) and Microwave (L-band ALOS-PALSAR) images along with other bio-climatic parameters (e.g., rainfall, temperature) which significantly influence the biomass accumulation in an ecosystem. Plot level biomass estimates for 6678 sample plots (0.1 ha size), inventoried as part of robustly designed National Forest Inventory (NFI), are computed using volumetric equations, wood density and biomass expansion factors. Spatial above ground biomass estimates were generated using random forest model over two scenarios. Firstly, a single nation-wide model using all the available plot data and secondly, physiographic zone (14 zones over India) wise models with plot data over respective zones. AGB stored in Indian forest is estimated as 7952.3 million tonnes (Carbon equivalent: 3737.58 TgC) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 31.2% using national level model. Physiographic zone level models estimated the country's biomass as 7597.45 million tonnes (Carbon equivalent: 3570.8 TgC). The above ground biomass estimates from our study indicates that the estimation error in physiographic zone model varies from 25.24% to 54.15% depending upon the sample size and biomass range. We observed that L-band microwave saturated in 140-160 Mg ha-1 range and currently available microwave wavelengths alone is not sufficient to predict entire range of biomass over Indian forests. Inclusion of multisource data using random forest regression model increase the saturation range to 350 Mg ha-1 which is a significant improvement as 94.7% of Indian forests are covered in this range. Model estimation error reduces to 25.6% in AGB range up to 350 Mg ha-1.

TI  - Technological opportunities for measuring and monitoring blue carbon initiatives in mangrove ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play a crucial role in the carbon cycle and mitigate climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, mangrove ecosystems have declined dramatically in most regions due to natural and human factors, resulting in the release of substantial amounts of carbon dioxide. 'Blue carbon' conservation and restoration initiatives seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support adaptation in mangrove areas. Various methods are employed to estimate, map, and monitor the extent and dynamics of mangrove biomass and carbon stocks, and these play a critical role in sustainable management and the climate policy and market instruments which can provide financial support for ecosystem conservation and restoration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of different mapping and monitoring methods applied from 2010 to 2020 for carbon stocks in mangrove forests, and highlights the limitations of previous studies. Destructive sampling, use of allometric equations, and remote sensing technologies are described and assessed. Passive and active sensors at various spatial resolutions (1 m-30 m), and supervised and unsupervised classification methods, are discussed. A novel aspect of this paper is the assessment of monitoring methods and the uncertainty of carbon stock estimation in mangrove forests. The study discusses the advantages and drawbacks of existing methods for mangrove carbon stock measurement and provides recommendations for effective application of blue carbon studies in global markets.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Despite the increased use of sedation in children undergoing stressful procedures, reduction of ileocolic intussusception (RII) is usually performed on awake children without any form of sedation.Objective To evaluate the incidence of severe complications of RII under sedation or anaesthesia.Design A systematic review including English language original articles of any date.Patients Children undergoing RII (pneumatic or hydrostatic) under sedation or anaesthesia.Data sources Ovid Embase, Scopus, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the internet search engine Google Scholar.Data extraction Three authors independently reviewed each article for eligibility. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of included studies.Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the incidence of intestinal perforation during RII. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of sentinel adverse events defined as death, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, permanent neurological deficit and pulmonary aspiration syndrome.Results The search yielded 368 articles. Nine studies with 1391 cases were included in the analysis. Of the nine studies, six had a score of <= 6 stars in the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assessment, indicating low-to-moderate quality. Propofol-based sedation was used in 849 (59.2%) cases; 5 (0.6%) had intestinal perforation. Intestinal perforation was not reported in patients who were sedated with other sedatives. One patient had pulmonary aspiration syndrome.Conclusions Although caution remains warranted, current data suggest that the incidence of severe complications due to RII under sedation or anaesthesia is low. Due to the lack of prospective data, it is difficult to ascertain the exact incidence of severe complications.

TI  - Immune Characters and Plasticity of the Sentinel Lymph Node in Colorectal Cancer Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. This study is aimed at immunologically characterizing sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and identifying changes in immunological phenotype and function of SNs isolated from the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Methods. A total of 53 pairs of matched SNs and non-SNs (NSNs) were collected by using a lymph node tracer dye. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the immunophenotype of T cells as well as the expression of activation and inhibitory markers. Differential expression and distribution of characteristic immune cell markers were analyzed by multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC). Transcriptomics analysis was conducted to compare the differences in the expression of immune-related genes among lymph nodes. The ex vivo culture of lymph nodes was carried out to examine changes in immunological phenotypes and functions. Results. Compared with NSNs, SNs harbored a significantly higher percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) but a lower proportion of MoMDSCs. As indicated in the mIHC assays, Tregs, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and M2 macrophages were mainly distributed in cortical areas, germinal centers, and subcapsular sinus areas, respectively, while significantly higher numbers of Tregs and Tfh cells were detected in SNs as compared to NSNs. Moreover, GSEA revealed that T cell activation genes and CD8+ T cell exhaustion-related genes are enriched in SNs and NSNs, respectively. The ex vivo culture led to an increase in the proportion of CD4+ cells, while activating T cells in SNs. In addition, SNs displayed a higher increase in the expression of cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and sFas than NSNs. Conclusion. SNs are shown to be in an immune active state in vivo, while highly expressing inhibitory cytokines and suppressive markers. The ex vivo culture enhanced antitumor immunological function of SN-T cells, providing a starting material for adoptive cell therapy for CRC.

TI  - Local climatic and environmental effects of an onshore wind farm in North China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the possible local climatic and environmental impacts of an onshore wind farm in North China, meteorological observation and satellite remote sensing data around the wind farm were collected, and the soil chemical composition within and outside of the wind farm was determined. Our analysis revealed changes in the spatial patterns of wind, air temperature (T-a), ground surface temperature (T-s), land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from before to after the construction of the wind farm. The two datasets of meteorological observations showed that wind speed decreased after the construction of the wind farm, with one dataset indicating a significant decrease. Since the construction of the farm, T-a and T-s have shown increasing trends, and ET has shown a significant increasing trend. The nighttime T-a and LST showed opposite trends, with T-a decreasing and LST increasing. The change in LST was the greatest at the wind farm and in its downwind zone, indicating that the operation of the wind farm affects the LST within and beyond the 10 km buffer zone. After the wind farm construction, the NDVI showed a significant positive trend. However, increases in the concentrations of Ti and Co were observed, suggesting that the construction and operation of wind farm may promote vegetation growth and cause soil pollution. The monitoring of wind farms needs to be strengthened to reveal the long-term impacts of wind farms on local climates and ecosystems.

TI  - CT-Overlay Hybrid Imaging to Facilitate Sentinel Cerebral Protection System Deployment in the Presence of an Anomalous Vertebral Artery Originating From the Aortic Arch During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stroke remains an important risk during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Though the use of the double-filter Sentinel cerebral protection system (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) may lower the stroke risk, the deployment of this device requires manipulation within the aortic arch and cranial arch vessels potentially causing dislodgment of atherosclerotic debris in the process thereby possibly offsetting its benefit with regards to reducing cerebral embolization. Apart from patient selection, minimizing maneuvering during deployment may improve the safety of device deployment. In this context, we illustrate a case using three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) - overlay to facilitate Sentinel cerebral protection system deployment during TAVI. Emphasis in this case rests on demonstration of how aforementioned periprocedural imaging may facilitate negotiation of anatomical variants and avoid inadvertent cannulation of an anomalous left vertebral artery originating from the aortic arch. Imaging guidance with this concept may minimize device manipulation and reduce the risk of cerebral embolization. Further systematic evaluation is needed to demonstrate whether this approach improves clinical outcomes. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Addressing management practices of private forests by remote sensing and open data: A tentative procedure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The qualitative and quantitative knowledge of forestry stands is a fundamental requirement for their management and exploitation planning. Traditional field measurements, based on plots, are certainly accurate, but time-consuming and expensive; moreover, it cannot provide a wall-to-wall estimate of measures over large areas. Even though they are essential for calibrate and validate models and respectively results, remote sensing could be a useful support for forest planners when trying to describe wide areas. Optical images from medium-high resolution satellite missions are widely employed due to their accessibility, affordability and readiness to use. Within this framework, in this study an approach based on open-data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and Regional low density LiDAR data was developed in order to assess private forest wood resource in the Susa Valley (Piemonte Region, NW - Italy). The proposed methodology aims to support private forest management by the local forest consortium for basal area and wood volume estimation of forest stands. Specifically, the process was based on the jointly use of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN), trained and validated with respect to ground data from 285 surveyed plot. Furtherly, to refined wood volume estimates correcting factors accounting for slope and local stand fertility were applied. Estimates of volume stands were generated separately for conifers and broadleaves. Results prove that the adoption of correcting factors improved volume estimates by the MLP and ANN about 2% (relative mean absolute error) and 13% in conifer and broadleaf stands respectively.

AB  - We developed an easy-to-use scoring system that uses preoperatively available data and is capable of distinguishing between patients with pN0-N1 and pN2-N3 breast cancer with a high degree of accuracy. This scoring model could be useful to identify preoperative patients with a lower risk of advanced axillary lymph node metastasis and thereby avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection.Background: It has been determined that axillary lymph node dissection after the detection of limited axillary lymph node metastasis does not improve the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Thus, a need exists for less-invasive axillary surgery. However, it remains unclear whether a predictive model based on preoperative data would be sufficient to accurately predict the probability of pN2-N3 (> 3 lymph node metastases). We sought to develop an easy-to-use scoring system to distinguish between pN0-N1 (0-3 lymph node metastases) and pN2-N3 using only preoperative data and validate its predictive performance. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified 2687 patients diagnosed with cT1-3cN0-N1 who had undergone surgery in our hospital from 2013 to 2019. We evaluated the risk factors associated with pN2-N3 by logistic regression analysis and developed a scoring system. Predictive performance was assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and was validated using K-fold cross-validation. Results: We identified 1987 patients with stage pN0, 522 with pN1, and 178 with pN2-N3. Multivariate analysis revealed tumor size, number of suspicious lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound examination, histologic type, histologic grade, and receptor status were significant risk factors for pN2-N3. The AUC value was 0.87, and the mean AUC of the 10-fold cross-validation was 0.88. When the cutoff score was set at 6, the negative predictive value for excluding patients with pN2-N3 was 98.4%. Conclusion: Our easy-to-use scoring system could be useful to preoperatively identify patients at lower risk of pN2-N3 and avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - A novel forecasting model for wind speed assessment using sentinel family satellites images and machine learning method
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind energy produced in near and offshore farms is constantly increasing, mainly thanks to the use of new technologies and the economic costs decrease. Data coming from satellites recently launched can be effectively used in near and offshore areas for wind speed mapping, and long and short-term analyses of wind regimes. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence methods is constantly increasing for predicting wind energy production. In this framework, a new forecasting model for wind speed assessment is presented integrating Sentinel satellite imagery analysis, in two phases using multi-sensor satellites, and machine learning methods. In the first step, wind speed and bathymetry have been analysed by means of sentinel-1 (S-1) and sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites images, respectively. Furthermore, a hybrid forecasting model has been proposed to assess and predict wind speed. The machine learning model consists of an integrated model using generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The new developed method has been then applied to assess wind energy potential around the Favignana island in Sicily, Italy. The results show that all the important primary parameters for a wind farm installations potential analysis, such as wind speed, water depth, and distance to the shoreline can be successfully analysed in a possible short time and freely. The following results have been obtained testing the new method: i) S-1 and S-2 satellite images have good potential for near and offshore wind speed assessment and bathymetry detection around Favignana island, ii) the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed forecasting model using the whole dataset are 0.0205, 0.0159, and 6.8385 respectively, iii) the proposed forecasting model for wind speed has higher accuracy than other valid models.

TI  - Pathological conditions of the sentinel bivalve, the little mussel Brachidontes rodriguezii, from contaminated intertidal sites in the Southwestern Atlantic coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A survey of pathological conditions affecting the natural beds of the dominant bivalve species of the intertidal rocky coasts of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, was performed. Samples of the little mussel (n = 992), Brachidontes rodriguezii, which is considered a sentinel species, were collected from seven sites that present different anthropogenic activity (low anthropogenic activity, harbor, and sewage waste) along the Argentinean coast, and processed by standard histological techniques. Our results showed for the first time in a B. rodriguezii population from Mar del Plata harbor a bacterium causing cellular lysis of the spermatogenic cells (6.5% of prevalence) and in a population from Villa Gesell, a site with low anthropogenic activity, one little mussel presented cytoplasmic vacuoles in the oocytes's cytoplasm similar to a microsporidian (0.2% of prevalence). A ciliated protozoan parasitizing the cytoplasm of the epithelial digestive tubules and larval stages of two different digenean parasites, was found infecting the little mussel from both contaminated and uncontaminated sites. Sporocysts of the family Bucephalidae invaded the gonad, causing severe gonadal damage including castration, and gymnophallid metacercariae located between the mantle and shell or embedded in the mantle tissues, occupied the gonadal space. In Punta Carballido, a site located next to a sewage outfall, the highest prevalence of infection was found, for the ciliated protozoan in the digestive tubules (5.1%) and for the digenean parasites (bucephalid sporocyst 24.4%, and gymnophallid metacercariae 50%). Moreover, we found a positive correlation between shell length and overall prevalence of parasites.

TI  - Does <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-tilmanocept, as next generation radiotracer, meet with the requirements for improved sentinel node imaging?
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and objectives: To evaluate the migration of Tc-99m-tilmanocept from the injection site (IS) as well as the uptake in sentinel nodes (SNs) and non-SNs for lymphatic mapping in patients with breast cancer and melanoma, scheduled for SN biopsy after interstitial tracer administration.Materials and methods: For 29 primary tumours in 28 patients (mean age: 62y, range: 45-81y) scheduled for SN biopsy planar images were acquired 10 and 120 min after administration of 74 MBq Tc-99m-tilmanocept, in order to evaluate lymphatic drainage as well as uptake ratios between injection site (IS), SN and non-SN. SPECT/CT was performed immediately after delayed planar images to enable anatomical lymph node localization.Results: SNs were visualized in all patients (100%) with drainage to 34 basins. Uptake in non-SNs was perceived in 16 basins (47%). Number of SNs was concordant between early and delayed images in all basins excepting five (86%). In 24 patients tracer migrated to one lymph node basin (LNB), in three to 2 and in one to 4. When IS was included (n = 29) on image, IS/SN ratio could be measured per LNB. The IS/SN ratio at 2 h compared to 15 min decreased with an average of 66% (range: 15-96%). SN/non-SN 2 h ratio in LNBs with visible non-SNs averaged 6.6 (range: 2.3-15.6). In 9 patients with two SNs SN1/SN2 ratio averaged 1.9 on delayed images. At histopathology, SNs were found to be tumour positive in 7 basins (20%).Conclusion: Tc-99m-tilmanocept appears to meet the requirements for improved SN imaging in breast cancer and melanoma on the basis of early and persistent SN visualization frequently accompanied by no or markedly less non-SN uptake.This is associated to rapid migration from the injection site together with increasing SN uptake and retention as expressed by decreasing IS/SN and persistently high SN/non-SN ratios. Further head-to-head comparison of Tc-99m-tilmanocept with standard SN radiotracers in larger series of patients is necessary. (C) 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

TI  - A multi-scale assessment of fire scar mapping in the Great Victoria Desert of Western Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire management is increasingly acknowledged as a necessary tool to maintain diversity in desert environments such as the Great Victoria Desert of Australia, but it needs to be informed by accurate fire history data. We compared and assessed the utility of Landsat-derived and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived burnt area mapping (30 m and 250 m resolution, respectively) for sub-regional, landscape and habitat scale management. We did so by using Sentinel-2-derived, 10 m resolution, burnt area mapping as a reference, to determine the most appropriate product to support land management planning. At the landscape scale, Landsat had significantly lower average omission and commission errors (3.4% and 8.0%, respectively) compared with that of MODIS (42.2% and 19.9%, respectively). At the habitat scale, Landsat burnt area percentage was more accurate, in plots of 500 m x 500 m (root mean square error (RMSE) 0.6% to 8.6%), but offered lower accuracy when estimating partially burnt habitat plots of 120 m x 120 m (RMSE 14.1% to 23.9%). Only Landsat-derived fire scar mapping provided enough detail to produce reliable fire history maps to inform fire management and biodiversity conservation operations at a sub-regional scale, landscape scale and a habitat scale of 500 m by 500 m.

AB  - Aims Cutaneous melanoma accounts for 90% of all melanoma cases diagnosed. In addition, the incidence of cutaneous melanoma is increasing by approximately 3-7% yearly, and it is the most rapidly increasing cancer diagnosed in white populations worldwide. The aim of this study is to assess the survival benefit of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) in cutaneous melanoma in an Irish population. Methods Population based data was obtained from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI) on all patients with a cutaneous melanoma diagnosed over a 20-year period 1994-2014 and predictors of Overall Survival (OS) were assessed. Results 13302 patients were identified with a melanoma diagnosis between 1994-2014. OS varied with gender, age, smoking and marital status, anatomical location and TMN stage. 2196 (17%) patients underwent SLNB, which included 710 patients in the stage 1 melanoma category (<11% of this group). Undergoing a SLNB was not an independent predictor of improved OS (p=0.440). However, a positive SLNB result was an independent predictor of OS (0.001). Conclusion This Irish population-based data re-affirms demographic indicators of poorer survival. A positive SLNB result indicates poorer survival; however, the precedent itself is not a predictor of OS.

TI  - Validation of the US Geological Survey's Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (LCMAP) Collection 1.0 annual land cover products 1985-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (USGS LCMAP) has released a suite of annual land cover and land cover change products for the conterminous United States (CONUS). The accuracy of these products was assessed using an independently collected land cover reference sample dataset produced by analysts interpreting Landsat data, high-resolution aerial photographs, and other ancillary data. The reference sample of nearly 25,000 pixels and the accompanying 33-year time series of annual land cover reference labels allowed for a comprehensive assessment of accuracy of the LCMAP land cover and land cover change products. Overall accuracy (+/- standard error) for the per-pixel assessment across all years for the eight land cover classes was 82.5% (+/- 0.2%). Overall accuracy was consistent year-to-year within a range of 1.5% but varied regionally with lower accuracy in the eastern United States. User's accuracy (UA) and producer's accuracy (PA) for CONUS ranged from the higher accuracies of Water (UA = 96%, PA = 93%) and Tree Cover (UA = 90%, PA = 83%) to the lower accuracies of Wetland (UA = 69%, PA = 74%) and Barren (UA = 43%, PA = 57%). For a binary change/no change classification, UA of change was 13% (+/- 0.5%) and PA was 16% (+/- 0.6%) for CONUS when agreement was defined as a match by the exact year of change. UA and PA improved to 28% and 34% when agreement was defined as the change being detected by the map and reference data within a +/- 2-year window. Change accuracy was higher in the eastern United States compared to the western US. UA was 49% (+/- 0.3) and PA was 54% (+/- 0.3) for the footprint of change (defined as the area experiencing at least one land cover change from 1985 to 2017). For class-specific loss and gain when agreement was defined as an exact year match, UA and PA were generally below 30%, with Tree Cover loss being the most accurately mapped change (UA = 25%, PA = 31%). These accuracy results provide users with information to assess the suitability of LCMAP data and information to guide future research for improving LCMAP products, particularly focusing on the challenges of accurately mapping annual land cover change.

TI  - Appearance based deep domain adaptation for the classification of aerial images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses appearance based domain adaptation for the pixel-wise classification of remotely sensed data using deep neural networks (DNN) as a strategy to reduce the requirements of DNN with respect to the availability of training data. We focus on the setting in which labelled data are only available in a source domain D S, but not in a target domain D T, known as unsupervised domain adaptation in Computer Vision. Our method is based on adversarial training of an appearance adaptation network (AAN) that transforms images from D S such that they look like images from D T. Together with the original label maps from D S, the transformed images are used to adapt a DNN to D T. The AAN has to change the appearance of objects of a certain class such that they resemble objects of the same class in D T. Many approaches try to achieve this goal by incorporating cycle consistency in the adaptation process, but such approaches tend to hallucinate structures that occur frequently in one of the domains. In contrast, we propose a joint training strategy of the AAN and the classifier, which constrains the AAN to transform the images such that they are correctly classified. To further improve the adaptation performance, we propose a new regularization loss for the discriminator network used in adversarial training. We also address the problem of finding the optimal values of the trained network parameters, proposing a new unsupervised entropy based parameter selection criterion, which compensates for the fact that there is no validation set in D T that could be monitored. As a minor contribution, we present a new weighting strategy for the cross-entropy loss, addressing the problem of imbalanced class distributions. Our method is evaluated in 42 adaptation scenarios using datasets from 7 cities, all consisting of high-resolution digital orthophotos and height data. It achieves a positive transfer in all cases, and on average it improves the performance in the target domain by 4.3% in overall accuracy. In adaptation scenarios between the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets from the ISPRS semantic labelling benchmark our method outperforms those from recent publications by 10 20% with respect to the mean intersection over union.

TI  - Comprehensive error analysis of satellite precipitation estimates based on Fengyun-2 and GPM over Chinese mainland
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal error characteristics of four mainstream satellite precipitation products developed by China and United States, respectively, including the Fengyun-based (FY-2F and FY-2G) and the GPM-based (IMERGLate and IMERG-Final) over Chinese mainland were comprehensively analyzed from January 2018 to December 2019. In general, both IMERG-Final and FY-2G perform better at the hourly and daily scales. While the FY-2F product has the relatively worst performance with lowest correlation coefficient (CC) and highest root mean square error (RMSE) values. In particular, FY-2F has considerable total bias and missed precipitation errors in summer when compared to other three precipitation products. As for winter, the IMERG product suites exhibit significantly overestimation in north-central region of China, while an opposite underestimation occurred in the Fengyun products. Among the four precipitation estimates, IMERG-Final and FY-2G have the lowest normalizedRMSE (NRMSE) at the elevation range of 100-300 m and 300-500 m at daily scale, respectively. The performance at the hourly scale was found to be similar for IMERG-Final and IMERG-Late, but both of which are slightly superior to FY-2G across the elevation ranges. In terms of the detectability for different rain intensities, the IMERG products performed best at higher rain rates, while the Fengyun-based precipitation estimates are superior to IMERG at relatively lower rain ones. The assessment results reported here will provide some valuable feedbacks for algorithm developers of Fengyun products, and enable data users to further understand the error characteristics and potential deficiencies of Fengyun precipitation estimates.

TI  - A Gather-to-Guide Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation of RGB and Auxiliary Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature fusion of RGB and auxiliary remote sensing data is known to enable improved semantic segmentation. However, such fusion is challengeable because of the substantial variance in data characteristics and quality (e.g., data uncertainties and misalignment) between two modality data. In this article, we propose a unified gather-to-guide network (G2GNet) for remote sensing semantic segmentation of RGB and auxiliary data. The key aspect of the proposed architecture is a novel gather-to-guide module (G2GM) that consists of a feature gatherer and a feature guider. The feature gatherer generates a set of cross-modal descriptors by absorbing the complementary merits of RGB and auxiliary modality data. The feature guider calibrates the RGB feature response by using the channel-wise guide weights extracted from the cross-modal descriptors. In this way, the G2GM can perform RGB feature calibration with different modality data in a gather-to-guide fashion, thus preserving the informative features while suppressing redundant and noisy information. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed G2GNet is robust to data uncertainties while also improving the semantic segmentation performance of RGB and auxiliary remote sensing data.

TI  - Spring phenological variability promoted by topography and vegetation assembly processes in a temperate forest landscape
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenological processes significantly impact ecosystem function and services across multiple ecological scales and are widely viewed to be among the most sensitive indicators of global environmental change. Remote sensing has crucially expanded our understanding of phenological variability. Yet, we continue to lack a complete mechanistic understanding of phenology and its variability and drivers, which is important to the development of predictive models, especially under continued environmental change. We combined field inventories and Land Surface Phenology (LSP) approaches, using 36 years of Landsat phenological observations, to characterize the degree to which long-term spring greenup patterns are shaped by topography, vegetation, and topographically structured vegetation assembly processes within a dissected forest landscape in southeastern Ohio. We found temporal and spatial variability among the field samples where greenup patterns displayed rapid change (18 total days) over relatively short distances (<1 km). Slope position explained the most variation (35%), where the bases of hills displayed the latest timing in spring greenup. However, we found that differences in terrain aspect and slope influenced canopy diversity, height, and composition of forest stands, influencing plant community processes that support heterogeneity in spring leaf-out timing. Understanding how forest phenology is shaped by direct and often complex interacting processes that influence the distribution of species assemblages supports new insight into phenological variability and, importantly, the management of forest ecosystems facing continued environmental change.

TI  - Ratiometric Raman nanotags enable intraoperative detection of metastatic sentinel lymph node
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging and biopsy has been advocated as an important technique to evaluate the metastatic status of regional lymph nodes and determine subsequent surgical procedure for many cancers, yet there is no reliable means to provide accurate and rapid diagnosis of metastatic SLN during surgery. Here we develop a new approach, named "Ratiometric Raman dual-nanotag strategy", that using folic acid functionalized targeted and nontargeted gap-enhanced Raman tags (FA-GERTs and Nt-GERTs) to detect metastatic SLN based on Raman imaging combined with classical least square data processing methods. By using this strategy, with builtin self-calibration for signal correction, rather than absolute intensity-dependent signal readout, we realize the visualization and prompt intraoperative diagnosis of metastatic SLN with a high accuracy of 87.5 % when the cut-off value of ratio (FA-GERTs/Nt-GERTs) set at 1.255. This approach may outperform the existing histopathological assessment in diagnosing SLN metastasis and is promising for guiding surgical procedure in the future.

TI  - The Emergence and Initial Impact of Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) in the United States Virgin Islands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral communities in the Caribbean face a new and deadly threat in the form of the highly virulent multi-host stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD). In late January of 2019, a disease with signs and characteristics matching that of SCTLD was found affecting a reef off the coast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). Identification of its emergence in the USVI provided the opportunity to document the initial evolution of its spatial distribution, coral species susceptibility characteristics, and its comparative impact on coral cover at affected and unaffected coral reef locations. Re-assessments at sentinel sites and long-term monitoring locations were used to track the spread of the disease, assess species affected, and quantify its impact. The disease was initially limited to the southwest of St. Thomas for several months, then spread around the island and to the neighboring island of St. John to the east. Differences in disease prevalence among species were similar to reports of SCTLD from other regions. Highly affected species included Colpophyllia natans, Eusmilia fastigiata, Montastraea cavernosa, Orbicella spp., and Pseudodiploria strigosa. Dendrogyra cylindrus and Meandrina meandrites were also highly affected but showed more variability in disease prevalence, likely due to initial low abundances and the rapid loss of colonies due to disease. Siderastrea spp. were less affected and showed lower prevalence. Species previously reported as unaffected or data deficient that were found to be affected by SCTLD included Agaricia spp., Madracis spp., and Mycetophyllia spp. We also observed multi-focal lesions at SCTLD-affected sites on colonies of Porites astreoides, despite that poritids have previously been considered low or not susceptible to SCTLD. Loss of coral cover due to acute tissue loss diseases, which were predominantly SCTLD, was significant at several monitoring locations and was more impactful than previous mass bleaching events at some sites. There are no signs that the USVI SCTLD outbreak is abating, therefore it is likely that this disease will become widespread across the U.S. Caribbean and British Virgin Islands in the near future.

TI  - Land Subsidence in Beijing's Sub-Administrative Center and Its Relationship with Urban Expansion Inferred from Sentinel-1/2 Observations
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing's Sub-Administrative Center (BSAC) is located in the South-eastern Beijing Plain, which exhibits severe subsidence. The rapid urban expansion in recent years has aggravated land subsidence and threatens the safe operation of Beijing. First, this study applied the persistent scatterer-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) to extract BSAC subsidence time series data. Second, combined with the index-based built-up index (IBI), expansion intensity index (EII), and expansion gradient index (EGI), the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion were retrieved from optical data. Finally, we examined the urban expansion effects on land subsidence at the regional and single-building scales. The results showed that the maximum subsidence velocity in the BSAC reached 121 mm/year from 2015 to 2018, and the urban construction land area increased by 22%. At the regional scale, there existed a positive correlation between land subsidence and EGI or EII. This indicated that urban expansion had a certain impact on land subsidence. Therefore, we further explored the relationship between construction and land subsidence at the single-building scale. The engineering construction effects on land subsidence were divided into three periods, namely, rapid settlement, rebound, and stable periods. Although construction had a significant influence on land subsidence, it did not cause subsidence mutation.

TI  - Daily sea ice concentration product based on brightness temperature data of FY-3D MWRI in the Arctic
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - A daily sea ice concentration (SIC) product in the Arctic, derived from the brightness temperature (TB) data of the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) sensor aboard on the FY-3D satellite, is described in this paper. The MWRI TB raw swath data were first processed into daily gridded data and then corrected using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sensor. An ASI algorithm, which uses daily dynamic tie points, was adopted to calculate daily SIC at 12.5 km polar stereographic projection from January 2018 to June 2020. Our generated MWRI SIC product was compared with the AMSR2 SIC based on the ASI algorithm that uses fixed tie points. For more detailed comparison, we then compared our MWRI SIC with the SIC from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The mean bias between our MWRI SIC and AMSR2 SIC is 4.24%. The absolute values of biases between the daily MWRI SIC and MODIS SIC range from 0.14% to 10.76%, better than the MWRI SIC product based on the NT2 algorithm published by the Chinese National Satellite Meteorological Center. The results show that our MWRI SIC product has a good quality and can be used as a basic dataset for sea ice extent records.

TI  - Urban Sprawl Assessment in Eight Mid-sized Indian Cities Using RS and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed studies focusing on the spatio-temporal urban sprawl in mid-sized Indian cities are relatively rare. In this context, the paper attempts to investigate urban sprawl in eight mid-sized Indian cities from diverse physiographic regions. The selected cities are Lucknow, Patna from Indo-Gangetic Plains, Ranchi, Raipur from the peninsular plateau, Thiruvananthapuram, Bhubaneswar from coastal belts, and Srinagar, Dehradun from the northern mountainous region. Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS), Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2018 were classified into built-up and non-built-up land cover classes. After obtaining satisfactory accuracy results, land cover change detection was conducted. A multivariable integrated urban sprawl index (USI) was formulated by combining eleven significant variables related to urban sprawl patterns and typologies. The results revealed the rapid growth of built-up areas in all the cities, mainly toward the periphery. Despite the rapid growth of built-up areas, there was a decline in population density in most cities. The USI values ranged from 20.73 in Thiruvananthapuram Urban Agglomeration (UA) to 11.28 in Dehradun UA. The urban sprawl assessment revealed the prevalence of outward expansion, shape irregularity of built-up patches, and rapid dispersion. The urban sprawl typologies (UST), such as secondary urban core and urban fringe, exhibited an increasing trend in all the cities. The study emphasizes the use of modern research tools to gather scientific evidence on the urban sprawl in mid-sized cities. The obtained results will guide the concerned authorities to prepare strategies for promoting urban sustenance.

TI  - A DPIM-InSAR method for monitoring mining subsidence based on deformation information of the working face after mining has ended
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mining of underground coal resources causes long-period and large-gradient deformation of the overlying surface of the working face. Due to the characteristic of long period of deformation, D-InSAR (Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology can be easily affected by temporal incoherence. When the surface deformation gradient exceeds the monitoring gradient of D-InSAR technology, the conventional D-InSAR technology will easily cause unwrapping failure, and thus is difficult to realize 3D (Three Dimensional) monitoring of mining-induced surface deformation. In order to solve the problems, a prediction method of 3D surface deformation based on D-InSAR and constraints of DPIM (Dynamic Probability Integral Method) model was studied in this paper. Firstly, SAR image data of the working face after the end of mining were processed by differential interference to obtain the LOS surface deformation during a period of time after the mining. Secondly, according to the relationship between D-InSAR LOS (Line Of Sight) deformation and 3D surface deformation, the D-InSAR observation equation for mining subsidence based on DPIM constraints was constructed. Then, the solution method of the condition equation of DPIM-InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) based on GA (Genetic Algorithm) was constructed. Finally, based on obtained LOS deformation, the 3D surface deformation of surface subsidence was obtained using the 3D prediction method based on DPIM-InSAR. The results of simulation experiments effectively verified the feasibility of the method. Differential interference processing was performed for Sentinel-1A data after the mining. The LOS deformation of the 1613 working face of Guqiao South Mine between 20 January 2018 and 25 February 2018 was obtained. 3D surface deformation from the beginning of the mining to completion was obtained using the proposed prediction method of 3D surface deformation and subsidence based on DPIM-InSAR (Dynamic Probability Integral Method). The predicted subsidence values were compared with the measured values. The results showed that the fitting errors of the LOS deformation were mostly within 3 mm. The fitting mean square error was +/- 2.37 mm (accounting for 6.7% of the maximum LOS deformation value), and the fitting accuracy was high. The fitting mean square error of subsidence was +/- 120 mm (accounting for 7.3% of the maximum subsidence). The results in engineering application show that the proposed 3D predicting method of surface deformation and subsidence based on DPIM-InSAR has certain practical values.

TI  - Deep learning-based remote sensing estimation of water transparency in shallow lakes by combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency is a key indicator of water quality as it reflects the turbidity and eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs. To carry out remote sensing monitoring of water transparency rapidly and intelligently, deep learning technology was used to construct a new retrieval model, namely, point-centered regression convolutional neural network (PSRCNN) suitable for Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images. The impact of input feature variables on the accuracy of the inversion model was examined, and the performance of an optimized PSRCNN model was also assessed. This model was applied to remote sensing images of three shallow lakes in the eastern China plain acquired in summer. The PSRCNN model, constructed using five identical bands from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images and 20 band combinations as the input variables, the input window size of 5 x 5 pixels, proves a good predictive ability, with a verification accuracy of R-2 = 0.85, the root mean squared error (RMSE) = 13.0 cm, and the relative predictive deviation (RPD) = 2.58. After the sensitive spectral analysis of water transparency, the band combinations that had correlation coefficients higher than 0.6 were selected as the new input feature variables to construct an optimized PSRCNN model (PSRCNNopt) for water transparency. The PSRCNNopt model has an excellent predictive ability, with a verification accuracy of R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 11.48 cm, and RPD =3.0. It outperforms the commonly retrieval models (band ratios, random forest, support vector machine, etc.), with higher accuracy and robustness. Spatial variations in water transparency of three lakes from the retrieval results by PSRCNNopt model are consistent with the field observations.

TI  - A survey of surgical management of the sentinel node positive melanoma patient in the post-MSLT2 era
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The evidence-based management of melanoma patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has undergone a dramatic shift following publication of practice-changing surgical trials demonstrating no melanoma-specific survival advantage for completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in this scenario. We aimed to survey how surgeons' clinical practice had shifted in response to new evidence from these trials, and at a time when there was starting to become available systemic adjuvant treatments for AJCC Stage III melanoma patients. Methods A web-based survey consisting of practice-based questions and hypothetical clinical scenarios about current melanoma practice with regard to positive sentinel node biopsy was developed and sent to the surgical members of a Melanoma and Skin Cancer (MASC) Trials group in December 2018. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results There were 212 invitations sent and 65 respondents (31%). Respondents were from 17 countries, 94% of whom practice in specialist melanoma centres or at referral centres. Of these 97% were familiar with the MSLT2 and DeCOG-SLT clinical trials. At survey, 5% of respondents reported routinely recommending CLND and 55% recommend CLND in selected cases. Respondents were most likely to recommend CLND when multiple SLNs were positive. Important factors for surgical decision-making mentioned included size of SLN deposit, number of positive SLNs and likely compliance with the recommended surveillance regimen. Conclusion In line with rapid adoption of published evidence, surgical management of Stage III melanoma has altered significantly, with few surgeons within the cohort now performing routine CLNDs after positive SLNB.

TI  - An automatic procedure for generating burn severity maps from the satellite images-derived spectral indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire, especially wildfire, which can be considered as one of the main threats to vegetation cover and animals' life, has attracted lots of attention from environmental researchers. To better manage the fire crisis and take the necessary measures to compensate for its damages, it is essential to have detailed information about the burn severity levels. Accordingly, satellite images and their spectral indices have been widely considered in the literature as powerful tools in producing burn severity information. Despite the efficiency of the previously proposed methods, the necessity of ground reference data for their thresholding step faces them with serious challenges. To address this problem, in this study, an automatic procedure based on the change-point analysis is presented for thresholding differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) and its another version, dNBR2. In this procedure, a mean-shift based change-point analysis is performed on the dNBR and dNBR2 images for classifying them into burn severity levels. Experiments, conducted on some parts of Alaska and California in the United States, illustrated the high efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, as an applied experiment, the severity of the fires, occurred in 2020 in the Khaeiz protected area in Iran, was estimated and compared with local reports.

TI  - Respect for every living being - Theological perspectives on the bioethical imperative
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Without ethical embedding, scientific and technological progress is unleashing more and more destructive consequences. In contrast to the 'forgetfulness of nature' of the rationalist worldview, a fundamental reorientation of thinking and the understanding of science are also required to safeguard the integrity of creation, especially the dignity of the human person. Modern 'risk societies' are challenged to self-reflexively adjust to the ambivalent consequences of scientific technical civilisation. One impulse of theology lies in pointing out the perspective of a renewed bioethical imperative from the perspective of Christian ethics of Creation, based on the biblical understanding of creation, which embeds human beings in the whole of creation and at the same time singles them out in a special way as the image of God and calls them to responsibility. The theological traditions that have been partially suppressed in modernity can make an important contribution to the development of a vision of fundamental ethical values forecological responsibility.Contribution: The following contribution addresses basic questions of understanding nature to expand the one-sided world view of classical rationalism. In doing so, the recognition of biblical traditions plays a central role for reorientation. Only in the horizon of a changed world view, can ethical impulses unfold their effectiveness.

TI  - Structural mapping and interpretation of lineaments related to the In Teria volcanism (southeastern Algeria) using Landsat 8 OLI TIRS images and aeromagnetic data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The In Teria region is located South-East of Algeria, in the North-East of the Illizi basin. Generally, this area is recognized as a volcanic region with circular craters controlled by faults. In this research, structural lineaments were extracted using aeromagnetic data and satellite images (Landsat 8 OLI TIRS), and the direction of distribution of volcanic craters was analyzed by the center-to-center method. The mains observations show, at different structural levels, the following results: 1- the directions of the surface lineaments are E-W, WNW-ESE and ENE-WSW while those of crustal scale are N-S, E-W, NNW-SSE to NW-SE. 2- The volcanic craters are located at the intersection of these two directions (E-W and NW-SE) with the N-S lineaments. Some of these directions are linked to a reactivation of Pan-African mega-shear zones (N-S, NW-SE to NNW-SSE) during the Cenozoic, and some others (NW-SE and NNW-SSE) had already been reactivated during the Cretaceous rifting. 3- The depth estimation methods used thanks to Euler deconvolution and Tilt derivative showed, for the first time, the presence of magnetic anomalies related to magmatic bodies at a shallow depth of 2.5-3 km. The spectral analysis method gave a depth of more than 11 km for the deep sources. 4- The depth of the basement estimated by 2D forward modeling according to an N-S profile which passes through the outcrop zone of the craters, varies from 200 to 6000 m. All these data and new results presented in this work helped to highlight on the dynamics of In Teria's volcanism and to derive an updated structural mapping of this volcanic region.

TI  - Examination of all-sky infrared radiance simulation of Himawari-8 for global data assimilation and model verification
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The systematic difference between observations and simulation from weather forecast model hampers effective data assimilation and model improvement. The purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics and cause of the systematic difference or observation-minus-background (O - B) bias for all-sky infrared radiances of the Himawari-8 satellite, and propose data assimilation preprocessings and model verification. The O - B bias in cloudy scenes showed substantial negative values because of the shortage of high-altitude clouds generated in the forecast model. Additionally, a positive bias appeared for thin ice clouds because of the excessive absorption of radiative transfer models (RTMs). These biases were traced based on a bottom-up approach investigating individual uncertainty of RTMs, observation calibration, and the forecast model using two RTMs, reference hyperspectral sounders and synergetic measurements of CloudSat and CALIPSO. Based on these findings, data assimilation preprocessing such as quality-control procedures excluding samples that models poorly reproduced was developed. Although the quality controls reduced the number of biased samples, non-negligible O - B biases remained. Possible problems and treatments for the biases were discussed, including bias correction, observation error inflation, and correction of the cloud effect parameter. The O-B statistics also suggested insufficient representation of the diurnal variation in the cloud fraction in the tropics. Modified physical processes in the forecast model to increase ice clouds were tested to help improve the model bias and develop data assimilation. This trial indicated the difficulty in improving both O - B bias and variance and the necessity of adjusting the cloud effect parameters in data assimilation.

TI  - Effect of ultraviolet radiation on the Nrf2 signaling pathway in skin cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Excessive exposure of skin to solar radiation is associated with greatly increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) resulting in oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, immunosuppression, the production of matrix metalloproteinase, DNA damage and mutations. These events lead to increased incidence of various skin disorders including photoaing and both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. The ultraviolet (UV) part of sunlight, in particular, is responsible for structural and cellular changes across the different layers of the skin. Among other effects, UV photons stimulate oxidative damage to biomolecules via the generation of unstable and highly reactive compounds. In response to oxidative damage, cytoprotective pathways are triggered. One of these is the pathway driven by the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). This transcription factor translocates to the nucleus and drives the expression of numerous genes, among them various detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. Several studies concerning the effects of UV radiation on Nrf2 activation have been published, but different UV wavelengths, skin cells or tissues and incubation periods were used in the experiments that complicate the evaluation of UV radiation effects. Conclusions This review summarizes the effects of UVB (280-315 nm) and UVA (315-400 nm) radiation on the Nrf2 signaling pathway in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. The effects of natural compounds (pure compounds or mixtures) on Nrf2 activation and level as well as on Nrf2-driven genes in UV irradiated human skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes are briefly mentioned as well.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimation using SEBAL algorithm integrated with remote sensing and experimental methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is one of the most important elements of the hydrological cycle. Estimation of evapotranspiration is imperative for effective forest, irrigation, rangeland and water resources management as well as to increase yields and for better crop management. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in estimating evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of corn in the Mediterranean region of Adana province, Turkey. The Landsat 8 satellite images from March to September 2018 were used to acquire the coefficients of the respective bands. Then, the net radiation flux on the earth's surface and the earth's heat flux is obtained using incoming-outgoing radiation fluxes from albedo, surface emissivity coefficients, land surface temperature, and plant indicators. Next, the sensible heat flux is calculated by determining the hot and cold pixels under consideration via the atmospheric stability conditions. Finally, evapotranspiration maps are plotted. The crop coefficient of corn is also estimated with the respected maps being plotted. To validate the outcomes from the SEBAL algorithm, experimental methods were employed to calculate the evapotranspiration values and evaluated using suitable performance metrics. The results showed that the SEBAL generated evapotranspiration values are in high agreement with the FAO Penman-Monteith method registering the highest correlation (R = 0.91) and the lowest error (RMSE = 1.14). In addition, the SEBAL method registered the highest correlation values of 0.89, 0.87 and 0.68 with Turk, Makkink and Hargreaves experimental methods, respectively. Moreover, the crop coefficients estimated using SEBAL also manifested an acceptable correlation with all methods. The highest correlation value registered was with the FAO Penman-Monteith method (R = 0.98). The outcomes show that since the performance of the SEBAL algorithm in estimating the actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient using Landsat 8 satellite images is acceptable, the SEBAL algorithm could be a very convenient method. Moreover, it could easily be assimilated into farming management systems and precision agriculture for better decision-making and higher yield.

TI  - Assessing implications of irrigation scheme in NASA-Land Information System Framework on land surface fluxes in Punjab, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the impact of irrigation on terrestrial fluxes through incorporation of satellite-derived irrigation scheme and crop datasets into the NOAH Land Surface Model in Punjab. NOAH 3.3 LSM was run at 0.05-degree resolution for three years from 2013 to 2015.The results show that the evapotranspiration (ET) and latent heat flux (LE) have increased significantly in the Northwestern and Central Punjab region while soil temperature has reduced in the area. The increase in LE is by about 32% for the growing seasons, DJFM (December January February March)and ASON (August September October November), which is balanced by the increase in ET by 26%. The soil temperature also witnesses cooling by 0.6 degrees at most locations. Besides, successfully demonstrating the effects of irrigation, the present study can also be relevant to water and energy cycles studies of an area that still lacks proper quantification of agricultural practices utilizing irrigation.

TI  - Use of electronic medical records to describe the prevalence of allergic diseases in Canada
T2  - ALLERGY ASTHMA AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Leveraging the data management resources of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) is a viable approach for describing the prevalence of allergic disease documented in primary care settings. Methods The dataset used for this study was inclusive of data from EMR initiation up to Dec 31st 2018. The sample included 1235 primary care providers representing 1,556,472 patients across Canada. Results In total, there were 536,005 patients with a documented allergy that fit into one of the 10 suggested categories. The allergy table includes 718,032 distinct entries representing 564,242 unique patients, which is 36.3% of the patients within the CPCSSN repository. The most common allergies recorded were drug allergy (39.0%), beta-lactam allergy (14.4%), environmental allergy (11.0%), and food allergy (8.0%). Anticipated upcoming studies include physician-documented drug allergy with a focus on beta-lactam allergy, as well as stinging insect allergy, among others. To our knowledge, these will also be the first such prevalence studies of primary care physician-documented allergic disease done in Canada. Interpretation The CPCSSN dataset represents electronic medical records from 1.5 million patients across Canada including documentation of allergic diseases. This dataset provides a national representative population to describe and characterize Canadian patients with common allergic conditions. This robust dataset provides the opportunity for health surveillance, and in particular data to explore the impact of allergic disease on primary care practice.

TI  - Crops planting structure and karst rocky desertification analysis by Sentinel-1 data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop planting structure (CPS) information and its relationship with the surrounding special environment can provide strong support for the adjustment of agricultural structure in areas with limited cultivated land resources, and it will help regional food security, social economy, and ecological balance adjustment. However, due to the perennial cloudy, rainy, and scattered arable land in Karst mountainous areas, the monitoring of planting structure by traditional remote sensing methods is greatly limited. In this regard, we focus on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing, which can penetrate clouds and rain, without light constraints to image. In this article, based on parcel-based temporal sequence SAR, the CPS in South China karst area was extracted by deep learning technology, and the spatial coupling relationship between CPS and karst rocky desertification (KRD) was analyzed. The results showed that: (a) The overall accuracy of CPS classifica-tion was 75.98%, which proved that the geo-parcel-based time series SAR has a good effect for the CPS mapping in the karst mountainous areas; (b) Through the analysis of the spatial relationship between the planting structure and KRD, we found that the lower KRD level caused the simpler CPS and the higher KRD grade caused more complex CPS and more richer landscape types. The spatial variation trend of CPS landscape indicates the process of water shortage and the deepening of KRD in farmland; (c) The landscape has higher connectivity (Contagion Index, CI 0.52-1.73) in lower KRD level and lower connectivity (CI 0.83-2.05) in higher KRD level, which shows that the degree of fragmentation and connection of CPS landscape is positively proportional to the degree of KRD. In this study, the planting structure extraction of crops under complex imaging environment was realized by using the farmland geo-parcels-based time series Sentinel-1 data, and the relationship between planting structure and KRD was analyzed. This study provides a new idea and method for the extraction of agricultural planting structure in the cloudy and rainy karst mountainous areas of Southwest China. The results of this study have certain guiding significance for the adjustment of regional agricultural planting structure and the balance of regional development.

TI  - Complementary water quality observations from high and medium resolution Sentinel sensors by aligning chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and turbidity algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution imaging spectrometers are prerequisite to address significant data gaps in inland optical water quality monitoring. In this work, we provide a data-driven alignment of chlorophyll-a and turbidity derived from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) with corresponding Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. For chlorophyll-a retrieval, empirical 'ocean colour' blue-green band ratios and a near infra-red (NIR) band ratio algorithm, as well as a semi-analytical three-band NIR-red ratio algorithm, were included in the analysis. Six million co-registrations with MSI and OLCI spanning 24 lakes across five continents were analysed. Following atmospheric correction with POLYMER, the reflectance distributions of the red and NIR bands showed close similarity between the two sensors, whereas the distribution for blue and green bands was positively skewed in the MSI results compared to OLCI. Whilst it is not possible from this analysis to determine the accuracy of reflectance retrieved with either MSI or OLCI results, optimizing water quality algorithms for MSI against those previously derived for the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and its follow-on OLCI, supports the wider use of MSI for aquatic applications. Chlorophyll-a algorithms were thus tuned for MSI against concurrent OLCI observations, resulting in significant improvements against the original algorithm coefficients. The mean absolute difference (MAD) for the blue-green band ratio algorithm decreased from 1.95 mg m(-3) to 1.11 mg m(-3), whilst the correlation coefficient increased from 0.61 to 0.80. For the NIR-red band ratio algorithms improvements were modest, with the MAD decreasing from 4.68 to 4.64 mg m(-3) for the empirical red band ratio algorithm, and 3.73 to 3.67 for the semi-analytical 3-band algorithm. Three implementations of the turbidity algorithm showed improvement after tuning with the resulting distributions having reduced bias. The MAD reduced from 0.85 to 0.72, 1.22 to 1.10 and 1.93 to 1.55 FNU for the 665, 708 and 778 nm implementations respectively. However, several sources of uncertainty remain: adjacent land showed high divergence between the sensors, suggesting that high product uncertainty near land continues to be an issue for small water bodies, while it cannot be stated at this point whether MSI or OLCI results are differentially affected. The effect of spectrally wider bands of the MSI on algorithm sensitivity to chlorophyll-a and turbidity cannot be fully established without further availability of in situ optical measurements.

TI  - Debunking Ford's relation to the past: history as "Bunk" in Emersonian perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to reconsider the significance of Henry Ford's claim that "History is more or less bunk". It argues that this seemingly philistine remark can be understood as a specific historiographical position which informed Ford's wider worldview, management approach and philosophy of industry. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on primary philosophical works, secondary criticism and archival evidence. These sources detail the context in which the claim was made, the ideas underpinning its articulation and the conceptual basis on which Ford's wider perspectives and contributions to historical experience can be interpreted. Findings This paper interprets Ford's claim as a gesture of allegiance to a deeper cultural sensibility that was informed by Ralph Waldo Emerson's transcendental view of history. Practical implications In addition to offering a rereading of Ford's historiographical position, Emerson's thought is discussed in relation to Ford's subsequent "living history" project (Greenfield Village), which is considered the materialisation of his historical and industrial worldview. Originality/value This interpretation reveals how a specific historiographical position held by one of the twentieth century's leading industrialists offers new insights into his wider worldview and philosophy of industry. It contributes to recent studies that challenge taken-for-granted narratives in management history and recent work that has highlighted the influence of transcendental principles on Ford's philosophy of industry.

TI  - An operational parameterization scheme of surface temperature-vegetation index contextual model for large-scale temporally continuous evapotranspiration estimation: The case study of contiguous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent review has suggested relatively simple contextual models would remain attractive in the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET). The surface temperature-vegetation index feature space model is a typical representative since it provides direct monitoring of ET using simply and effective contextual information. However, the temporally continuous estimation and large-scale application issues are not well identified at previous studies. Under this background, the main motivation for this study is to develop an operational new parameterization scheme within the feature space framework for large-scale temporally continuous ET estimation. Specifically, the spatial domain division strategy was first designed to obtain the optimal grid division size for large-scale ET estimation. The model boundaries of these sub-regions were parameterized using spatial domain based temporal domain information at seasonal scale. The applicability of new method was demonstrated over the entire contiguous United States (CONUS) in the year 2008 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer (MODIS) and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. The comparison between present method and traditional method indicates that the new parameterization scheme produced at different reference spatial domains has a slight accuracy improvement over the 14 FLUXNET sites. In addition, the new method holds unique advantages in its simplicity and continuity, especially superior in the temporally continuous estimation of ET over a large extended region. The validation results of 14 FLUXNET sites indicate the correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) the mean bias (B) values for continuous estimation of daily ET were 0.62, 28.430 W/m(2), 36.133 W/m(2) and -0.059, respectively. The comparison results with existing ET product also demonstrated the comparable of ET distribution and estimates. Meanwhile, the boundary parameters obtained at seasonal scale also enhanced the physical meanings of feature space model. Consequently, the new parameterization scheme proposed in this study can be regarded as a suitable tool to provide large-scale temporally continuous estimation of ET.

TI  - Significant variability of structure and predictability of Arctic Ocean surface pathways affects basin-wide connectivity
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic Ocean is of central importance for the global climate and ecosystem. It is a region undergoing rapid climate change, with a dramatic decrease in sea ice cover over recent decades. Surface advective pathways connect the transport of nutrients, freshwater, carbon and contaminants with their sources and sinks. Pathways of drifting material are deformed under velocity strain, due to atmosphere-ocean-ice coupling. Deformation is largest at fine space- and time-scales and is associated with a loss of potential predictability, analogous to weather often becoming unpredictable as synoptic-scale eddies interact and deform. However, neither satellite observations nor climate model projections resolve fine-scale ocean velocity structure. Here, we use a high-resolution ocean model hindcast and coarser satellite-derived ice velocities, to show: that ensemble-mean pathways within the Transpolar Drift during 2004-14 have large interannual variability and that both saddle-like flow structures and the presence of fine-scale velocity gradients are important for basin-wide connectivity and crossing time, pathway bifurcation, predictability and dispersion. The Transpolar Drift, which governs the transport of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and contaminants across the Arctic Ocean, varies interannually, and is affected by fine-scale flow structures and processes, according to high-resolution simulations and satellite data.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual variabilities of chlorophyll across the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Seasonal and interannual variabilities of surface and subsurface chlorophyll (Chl) in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) and Bay of Bengal were examined based on vertical Chl inferred from satellite data. Four biotic zones were identified by Empirical orthogonal function analysis, which represented different types of mixed layer processes. The areas south of Sri Lanka indicated the most significant Chl increase in the surface and subsurface during summer due to coastal upwelling. Surface Chl highs in the Sri Lanka Dome occurred every summer during the time series. Chl increases were also recorded in the southwestern Bay of Bengal during fall-winter in response to wind-induced divergence and convective mixing. The other two zones in south IO basin between 5 and 15 degrees S exhibited seasonal surface Chl highs in summer and subsurface Chl maximum during fall-winter. Wind-induced divergence plays a major role in the maintenance of this upwelling zone year-round; however, stratification inhibited the surface Chl increase in winter and results in enhanced Chl in the subsurface. The Chl interannual variability was related with Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) associated physical field oscillations. In positive IOD, wind divergence increased significantly along the eastern equatorial IO coast that contributed to Chl enhancement there, it decreased in Bay of Bengal and South IO and acted to reduce the Chl in these regions. In negative IOD, reversals in the forcing anomalies drove increasing Chl in Bay of Bengal and South IO and decreasing of that in the eastern equator. This resulted in significant correlations between IOD index and Chl confined in these regions. There are pronounced variance of phytoplankton carbon biomass in the Bay of Bengal in IOD events, however, less changes of that were seen over the South IO during IOD. Our findings imply that physiological changes in cellular pigmentation are the dominant cause of satellite-observed interannual variations in Chl in the South IO. Our results highlight the role of physiological processes in regulating Chl distributions, and support the use of Chl-based indices as indicators of climatic feedbacks.

TI  - Studying drought-induced forest mortality using high spatiotemporal resolution evapotranspiration data from thermal satellite imaging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought can have pervasive and wide-spread impacts to forest health, as evidenced in several severe events occurring over the recent decades. Extensive forest die-off due to drought can impair the ecological functioning of forests, impacting habitat, water yield and quality from forested lands, and altering forest fire dynamics and intensity. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for detecting and monitoring spatial patterns of forest mortality over large areas, exploiting free and open long-term image archives available at a range in spatial and temporal resolutions. While remotely sensed surface reflectances and vegetation indices have been widely used to study optical response of forest canopies to drought events, retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from thermal satellite imagery - particularly at resolutions approaching crown scale can provide insights into cumulative tree stresses that can incite disease and trigger mortality. In this study, we applied a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to estimate daily 30-m resolution ET and an associated Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) to study drought-induced mortality in a temperate forest at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, located in the central United States. The study covered the period from 2010 to 2014, including an exceptional drought year of 2012. Modeled ET agreed well with eddy flux measurements from the MOFLUX tower, with average monthly relative errors of 15%. Plot-scale ESI, describing temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-reference ET, was used as an index of relative forest health to investigate relationships between forest mortality and drought severity. ESI showed good agreement with observed predawn leaf water potential, especially during the drought year. Furthermore, plot scale ESI was also correlated with the subsequent year's tree mortality, suggesting the importance of considering the forest health condition prior to drought when studying drought-induced forest impacts. This study demonstrates the utility of multi-year ET remote sensing data at the stand or plot scale as an indicator of forest health and as a predictor of future mortality due to drought.

TI  - Observation and modeling of the historic "Godzilla" African dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin and the southern US in June 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes a massive African dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin and southern US in June 2020, which is nicknamed the "Godzilla" dust plume, using a comprehensive set of satellite and ground-based observations (including MODIS, CALIOP, SEVIRI, AERONET, and EPA Air Quality network) and the NASA GEOS global aerosol transport model. The MODIS data record registered this massive dust intrusion event as the most intense episode over the past 2 decades. During this event, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed by AERONET and MODIS peaked at 3.5 off the coast of West Africa and 1.8 in the Caribbean Basin. CALIOP observations show that the top of the dust plume reached altitudes of 6-8 km in West Africa and descended to about 4 km altitude over the Caribbean Basin and 2 km over the US Gulf of Mexico coast. The dust intrusion event degraded the air quality in Puerto Rico to a hazardous level, with maximum daily PM10 concentration of 453 mu gm(-3) recorded on 23 June. The dust intrusion into the US raised the PM2.5 concentration on 27 June to a level exceeding the EPA air quality standard in about 40% of the stations in the southern US. Satellite observations reveal that dust emissions from convection-generated haboobs and other sources in West Africa were large albeit not extreme on a daily basis. However, the anomalous strength and northern shift of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) together with the Azores low formed a closed circulation pattern that allowed for accumulation of the dust near the African coast for about 4 d. When the NASH was weakened and wandered back to the south, the dust outflow region was dominated by a strong African easterly jet that rapidly transported the accumulated dust from the coastal region toward the Caribbean Basin, resulting in the recordbreaking African dust intrusion. In comparison to satellite observations, the GEOS model reproduced the MODIS observed tracks of the meandering dust plume well as it was carried by the wind systems. However, the model substantially underestimated dust emissions from haboobs and did not lift up enough dust to the middle troposphere for ensuing long-range transport. Consequently, the model largely missed the satellite-observed elevated dust plume along the cross-ocean track and underestimated the dust intrusion into the Caribbean Basin by a factor of more than 4. Modeling improvements need to focus on developing more realistic representations of moist convection, haboobs, and the vertical transport of dust.

However, practical applications of polarization technology are still limited because of complexity of measurement and interpretation of polarimetric observations. In this study, we analyze the performance of a new component approach developed in the frame of the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. In addition to aerosol optical properties including particle size distribution, non-sphericity and index of refraction that are commonly derived from multi-angle radiance and polarization measurements, the GRASP/Component approach also provides some information about aerosol composition. Specifically, in this approach aerosol is modeled as an internal mixture of several components with distinctly different chemical compositions and known refractive indices. The approach is intended not only to provide additional insight on aerosol composition but also to improve retrieval of basic aerosol optical properties. This study presents comprehensive validation and evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), angstrom ngstro center dot m exponent (AE), fine mode AOD (AODF), coarse mode AOD (AODC), and single scattering albedo (SSA) as retrieved by the GRASP/ Component approach. The GRASP/Component products include aerosol retrievals using two different aerosol component mixing rules, i.e., Maxwell-Garnett (MG) effective medium approximation and a simple VolumeWeighted averaging (VW). The differences between the results obtained using these two assumptions are also discussed. The obtained results show that the aerosol optical property products of GRASP/Component approach have good agreement with the ground-based AERONET measurements, which is comparable to other PARASOL/ GRASP approaches. Specifically, the AOD retrieved by GRASP/Component approach show high correlation and nearly no bias both over land and ocean, as compared with AERONET. The more detailed aerosol properties such as AE, AODF, AODC and SSA also show one of the best comparisons with AERONET. These improvements can probably be attributed to the use of the additional physical constraints on spectral dependence of the complex refractive index and the reduction of total number of aerosol parameters directly retrieved in the GRASP/ Component approach. In addition, the choice of mixing rules had no significant effect on optical retrievals. With the exception of SSA, the results obtained based on the MG mixing rule were found to be slightly better over those obtained using VW mixing rule, especially for bias.

TI  - Cloud cooling effects of afforestation and reforestation at midlatitudes
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the large carbon sequestration potential, reforestation and afforestation (R&A) are among the most prominent natural climate solutions. However, while their effectiveness is well established for wet tropics, it is often argued that R&A are less advantageous or even detrimental at higher latitudes, where the reduction of forest albedo (the amount of reflected solar radiation by a surface) tends to nullify or even overcome the carbon benefits. Here, we carefully analyze the situation for R&A at midlatitudes, where the warming effects due to vegetation albedo are regarded to be almost balanced by the cooling effects from an increased carbon storage. Using both satellite data and atmospheric boundary-layer models, we show that by including cloud- albedo effects due to land-atmosphere interactions, the R&A cooling at midlatitudes becomes prevalent. This points to a much greater poten-tial of R&A for wet temperate regions than previously considered.

TI  - Genotype x region and genotype x production level interactions in Holstein cows
T2  - ANIMAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of the presence of genotype by environment interaction effects on important traits in Holstein cattle allows for the use of international genetic evaluations and a more efficient design of regional genetic evaluation programmes. The aim of this study was to determine the genotype x environment interaction effects in Chilean Holstein dairy cattle through the analysis of records corresponding to calvings between 1998 and 2015. Herds were classified in the central and southern regions of Chile based on herd location as well as by high and low levels of production environments based on the fat plus protein yield averages per herd within each region. The central region has a Mediterranean climate and a confined production system while the southern region has a humid temperate climate and a production system based on grazing with supplementation. Traits studied were milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat content (FC) and protein content (PC) by lactation, age at first calving (AFC) and calving interval (CI). Several four-trait mixed animal models were applied to environmental category data as different traits, which included herd-year-calving season (herd-year-birth season for AFC) and lactation number as fixed effects, and animal additive genetic, sire-herd, permanent environment and residual effects as random effects. Genetic correlations (r(g)) for MY, FY, FC, PC and CI were found to decrease as differences between environmental categories increased. The r(g) between the most extreme environmental categories considered in this study for AFC (0.26) was the only one found statistically lower than 0.60. Genetic correlation values statistically lower than 0.80 (P < 0.05) were observed for AFC, CI, MY, FY and PY between some environmental categories. If separate genetic evaluations are adopted as practical criteria when the value of rg is lower than 0.60, the consequence of improving a multi-trait economic breeding objective in this population is likely to be small unless extreme environmental categories are considered. However, a moderate decrease in selection response and re-ranking of selection candidates is expected for AFC, CI and yield traits when selection is performed in different environmental conditions. Genotype x environment interaction effects involving production systems in a Mediterranean climate and confinement vs. Temperate Oceanic climate and grazing with supplementation, and between two fat plus protein yield level categories within each environment, were at most moderate for the studied traits.

TI  - De-Escalating Axillary Surgery in Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: There is a trend towards de-escalating axillary staging and treatment in breast cancer patients. On account of neoadjuvant systemic therapy, node-positive breast cancer patients can achieve a pathological complete response of the axilla. It is hypothesized that these patients do not benefit from an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and thus may be spared the risk of severe post-surgical morbidity. In an effort to omit standard ALND, less invasive axillary staging procedures are being implemented to establish response-guided treatment. However, it is unclear which less invasive staging procedure is most accurate, and long-term data are missing with regard to their oncologic safety. Summary: This article provides an overview of the literature on currently used less invasive axillary staging procedures, the accuracy and feasibility of these procedures in clinical practice, important issues concerning axillary treatment, and issues to be addressed in ongoing or future studies. Key messages: More evidence is needed regarding the safety of replacing standard ALND by less invasive axillary staging procedures in terms of long-term prognosis. These less invasive staging procedures not only serve to select patients who may benefit from treatment de-escalation, but also to select patients who may benefit from treatment escalation.

TI  - Diurnal and seasonal trends and associated determinants of surface urban heat islands in large Bangladesh cities
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies have been conducted around the globe, however there is still a lack of information available regarding the intensity of SUHI (SUHII) in Bangladesh cities. This study focused on diurnal and seasonal SUHI variability, temporal trends and possible drivers in five major cities. Mean annual daytime SUHII ranged from 2.88 degrees C for Dhaka to 0.84 degrees C for Rajshahi, while nighttime intensity varied from 1.91 degrees C (Chittagong) to 0.30 degrees C (Sylhet). The pre-monsoon period exhibited the greatest magnitude and the seasonal amplitude during the winter season was positive for Dhaka and Khulna but negative for the other cities. Correlation analysis indicated that a dense city population, a high degree of imperviousness and the absence of greenery were likely to act singly, or in combination, to increase urban warming within these cities. An increasing warming trend during daytime was observed. The urban population of Bangladesh is projected to increase substantially in future (i.e., to 81.4 million by 2029), so the findings of this study provide valuable insights into this warming issue and will assist in the development of effective local-scale climate change adaptation plans.

TI  - Human Surfactant Protein SP-A1 and SP-A2 Variants Differentially Affect the Alveolar Microenvironment, Surfactant Structure, Regulation and Function of the Alveolar Macrophage, and Animal and Human Survival Under Various Conditions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The human innate host defense molecules, SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants, differentially affect survival after infection in mice and in lung transplant patients. SP-A interacts with the sentinel innate immune cell in the alveolus, the alveolar macrophage (AM), and modulates its function and regulation. SP-A also plays a role in pulmonary surfactant-related aspects, including surfactant structure and reorganization. For most (if not all) pulmonary diseases there is a dysregulation of host defense and inflammatory processes and/or surfactant dysfunction or deficiency. Because SP-A plays a role in both of these general processes where one or both may become aberrant in pulmonary disease, SP-A stands to be an important molecule in health and disease. In humans (unlike in rodents) SP-A is encoded by two genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) and each has been identified with extensive genetic and epigenetic complexity. In this review, we focus on functional, structural, and regulatory differences between the two SP-A gene-specific products, SP-A1 and SP-A2, and among their corresponding variants. We discuss the differential impact of these variants on the surfactant structure, the alveolar microenvironment, the regulation of epithelial type II miRNome, the regulation and function of the AM, the overall survival of the organism after infection, and others. Although there have been a number of reviews on SP-A, this is the first review that provides such a comprehensive account of the differences between human SP-A1 and SP-A2.</p>

TI  - Simplifying residual nitrogen (N<sub>min</sub>) sampling strategies and crop response
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, important nitrogen fertilizer decisions are often made at the early stages of plant development, when plants are not yet sufficiently indicative of their needs. Optimizing nitrogen fertilization of crops requires assessing the available soil mineral nitrogen content (N-min) at the beginning of the season and was assessed exemplarily for wheat and maize. Since 2020 a mandatory soil N-min, analysis for each crop on a representative field is required in Germany in zones characterized by increased nitrate concentrations in the groundwater, encompassing approximately 28 % of the arable land. However, soil analysis is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive and requires further optimization beyond the current practice.In this study, wheat fields in 2018 and 2019 and maize fields in 2018 were sampled in a grid pattern in spring, and the soil nitrate-N content was determined in 30 cm layers down to 60 cm soil depth in 11 fields and further down to 90 cm soil depth in two of the fields. For each single and the combined soil depths, all fields could be sampled with a deviation of less than 10 kg nitrate-N ha(-1) with only two soil samples. Overall, the reduced fieldspecific soil sampling strategy proved advantageous compared to crop-specific, regionally representative N-min, values offered by the official advisory authorities based on multiple averaged field investigations with an increased sampling intensity of 16 samples per field. Further, the reduced field-specific soil sampling strategy delivered more precise N-min, values by 11.2 kg nitrate-N ha(-1) for wheat fields and slightly less precise values by 4.8 kg nitrate-N ha(-1) for maize fields. The reduced field-specific soil sampling has great potential to reduce analysis and soil sampling costs. Nitrogen fertilization experiments supported the usefulness of the new simplified N-min, strategy. Multispectral in-season satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 could not adequately capture the spatial nitrate-N level differences and confirms soil samplings needs early in the season.Because most farmers base their fertilization strategy on regionally crop-specific aggregated N-min, values delivered by the official advisory system, we consider a simplified strategy to be more indicative of the field-specific soil N-min, status, which is eased by a markedly reduced sampling frequency and further simplifies the analysis by aggregating the separately analyzed soil depths to only one single depth. Further, currently available simplified on-farm analyses of the soil nitrate content allow for conducting more intensive field-specific soil N-min, analysis, thus contributing to improved nitrogen demand management and decreasing adverse environmental effects.

TI  - Paramedics assessing patients with complex comorbidities in community settings: results from the CARPE study
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The aim for this study was to provide information about how community paramedicine home visit programs best "navigate" their role delivering preventative care to frequent 9-1-1 users by describing demographic and clinical characteristics of their patients and comparing them to existing community care populations. Methods Our study used secondary data from standardized assessment instruments used in the delivery of home care, community support services, and community paramedicine home visit programs in Ontario. Identical assessment items from each instrument enabled comparisons of demographic, clinical, and social characteristics of community-dwelling older adults using descriptive statistics and z-tests. Results Data were analyzed for 29,938 home care clients, 13,782 community support services clients, and 136 community paramedicine patients. Differences were observed in proportions of individuals living alone between community paramedicine patients versus home care clients and community support clients (47.8%, 33.8%, and 59.9% respectively). We found higher proportions of community paramedicine patients with multiple chronic disease (87%, compared to 63% and 42%) and mental health-related conditions (43.4%, compared to 26.2% and 18.8% for depression, as an example). Conclusion When using existing community care populations as a reference group, it appears that patients seen in community paramedicine home visit programs are a distinct sub-group of the community-dwelling older adult population with more complex comorbidities, possibly exacerbated by mental illness and social isolation from living alone. Community paramedicine programs may serve as a sentinel support opportunity for patients whose health conditions are not being addressed through timely access to other existing care providers.

TI  - The incidence and magnitude of the hot-spot bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) signature in GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) 10 and 15 minute reflectance over north America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is the most recent U.S. geostationary satellite and has improved resolution and potential for land surface monitoring over previous GOES sensors. The ABI reflectance has diurnal variation due to surface reflectance anisotropy that can be significant, particularly when ABI observations are sensed under hot-spot sensing conditions when the solar and viewing directions coincide. The incidence and magnitude of the hot-spot signature in geostationary satellite data has not been well documented. In this study all the available GOES-16 ABI observations acquired every 15 min in 2018, and every 10 min in 2020, over the Conterminous United States, the southern states of Canada, and the northern states of Mexico, were examined. First, hot-spot sensing conditions were identified by finding ABI 1 km observations with scattering angles ((c)) > 175 degrees, 177 degrees, 178 degrees, 179 degrees, 179.9 degrees, and 179.99 degrees. ABI observations sensed near or in the hot-spot ((c) >175 degrees) were found to occur across the study area but only over a 36 day period in the spring (days 46-81 in 2018, and 47-82 in 2020) and over a 36 or 37 day period in the autumn (days 263-299 in 2018, and 264-299 in 2020). Considering either season in each year, about 3.4%, 1.2%, 0.5%, 0.14%, 0.0015%, and 0.000015% of the daytime observations were acquired with (c) >175 degrees, 177 degrees, 178 degrees, 179 degrees, 179.9 degrees, and 179.99 degrees, respectively. For certain days up to 5.85%, 3.32%, 2.04%, 0.65%, 0.01%, and 0.0001% of the daytime ABI observations across the study area were sensed with (c) > 175 degrees, 177 degrees, 178 degrees, 179 degrees, 179.9 degrees, and 179.99 degrees, respectively. These incidence percentages are not negligible. Even with the strictest hot-spot scattering angle definition ((c) >179.99 degrees) there were 3985 and 4484 hot-spot observations sensed in the spring and autumn of 2018, and 4753 and 5252 hot-spot observations sensed in the spring and autumn of 2020. The dates, times, and locations of the 2018 and 2020 hot-spots acquired with (c) >179.99 degrees are tabulated so that readers may obtain hot-spot ABI data for their own investigations. Second, the magnitude of the hot-spot reflectance in the ABI data was quantified by the difference between the ABI reflectance acquired in the hot-spot ((c) >179.99 degrees) and in the ABI observations sensed immediately before and after. A total of 1833 hot-spot observations in ten geographically elliptical regions (six in 2020 and four in 2018) over land each composed of >120 ABI observations acquired where the ABI reflectance appeared to be unambiguously cloud-free, cloud shadow-free, and uncontaminated by haze or smoke, were considered. For the 2020 ABI data, the hot-spot peak was characterized by an up to 36%, 38%, 42%, and 43% increase in red (0.64 mu m), near-infrared (NIR, 0.86 mu m), short-wave infrared 1 (SWIR1, 1.61 mu m), and SWIR2 (2.2 mu m) reflectance, respectively, for a 2.48 degrees scattering angle difference in the 10 min between successive ABI observations. For the 2018 ABI data, the hot-spot peak was characterized by an up to 43%, 46%, 47%, and 45% increase in red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 reflectance, respectively, for a 3.73 degrees change in scattering angle in the 15 min between successive ABI observations. The magnitude of the GOES-16 ABI hot-spot is significant and given its non-negligible incidence in the spring and autumn over north America should be taken into consideration for terrestrial applications.

TI  - A downscaled bathymetric mapping approach combining multitemporal Landsat-8 and high spatial resolution imagery: Demonstrations from clear to turbid waters
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution bathymetric maps of coral reefs can show the details of terrain. However, most satellite-based imagery with a spatial resolution < 10 m has only three visible bands and one near-infrared (NIR) band. When in situ bathymetric data are unavailable, it is difficult to map bathymetry from high spatial resolution imagery with spectral matching or empirical models for clear or turbid waters. In this study, we developed a downscaled bathymetric mapping approach (DBMA) that uses the water depth estimated from multitemporal Landsat-8 data to calibrate the empirical model for high spatial resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2A/B, GaoFen1/2, ZiYuan-3, and WorldView-2) in the absence of in situ bathymetric data. Our results show that DBMA provides high accuracy for depth ranging from 0 to 12 m for clear waters (0 m to 5 m for turbid waters), with a root mean squared error (RMSE) smaller than 2 m. Relative to empirical models (calibrated with in situ data), DBMA underestimates water depth more for depth >12 m for clear waters (5 m for turbid waters) while slightly overestimates more for depth < 4 m for clear waters (3 m for turbid waters). Nevertheless, DBMA performs better than the empirical models for depth between 4 m and 12 m for clear waters (3 m and 5 m for turbid waters). Furthermore, the good performance of DBMA is also demonstrated by the finding that the scaling effect on the DBMA is limited. DBMA presents a reliable solution to obtain high spatial resolution bathymetric maps without leaving out small regions in the absence of in situ data.

TI  - Estimating soil organic carbon of sown biodiverse permanent pastures in Portugal using near infrared spectral data and artificial neural networks
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands in Portugal are key managed ecosystems, supporting and providing a diverse number of ecosystem services. Here, we developed a procedure for rapid estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in soil samples of sown biodiverse permanent pastures rich in legumes (SBP) in Portugal. We combined laboratory NIR spectral data analysis with artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the SOC content of SBP soil samples. To train and test the ANN, we used more than 340 soil samples collected in the 0-20 cm topsoil layer from three farms in 2018 and 2019 and two other farms in 2019 only. The number of bands of the spectra (800-2778 nm) was reduced using two different approaches: (a) aggregation to Sentinel-2 (S2) bands using the average reflectance within each bandwidths; and (b) principal component analysis (PCA). For the S2 approach, we considered the six S2 bands that overlap with the spectral range of the instrument used. For the PCA approach, we considered the five first principal components. Additional covariates were used for prediction, including weather and terrain attributes, e.g. accumulated precipitation, average temperature, elevation, and slope. To test for transferability of the models to different farms, we used an eight-fold leave-one-out cross-validation approach to calculate estimation errors. Each fold is a unique combination of farm and year and is used to assess the model's performance calibrated from the seven other folds. The ANN was able to estimate both low and high SOC contents without systematic errors and with similar estimation errors for both full and reduced spectral data approaches. The average root mean squared error (RMSE) for the S2 approach was 1.95 g kg(-1) (0.45 - 2.33 g kg(-1) depending on the hold-out fold) and for the PCA approach was 1.81 g kg(-1) (0.74 - 2.42 g kg(-1)) (compared to the average SOC content of 12 g kg(-1)). These RMSE values were similar to the RMSE obtained using the full spectra, suggesting that the original spectral resolution could be reduced without losing information. These results suggest the potential for using remotely sensed data to estimate the variation of SOC content for SBP. They are a first step towards developing algorithms that can alleviate the cost and time of soil sampling and chemical SOC laboratory analysis through indirect estimation.

T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased reports of phytoplankton blooms in remote pristine lakes provide the perception that climate-driven fundamental changes may be occurring in lake ecosystems. There is a crucial need for detailed surveys of lakes covering large spatial and temporal scales to determine whether phytoplankton biomass is on the rise in northern forested landscapes. To characterize spatial and temporal variation in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass in lakes located in the relatively intact northern temperate forest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region, we developed a regression model that relates Landsat 4-5 TM and 7 ETM + optical reflectance in blue, green, and red bands to Chl-a from 45 lake water samples. Reflectance from the Landsat three-band algorithm ((B1-B3)/B2) showed the strongest correlation with in situ data explaining 78% of the variance in Chl-a. We applied this model to produce a 28-year time series of Chl-a in 12,644 lakes within the northern temperate forest. By applying a two-way analysis of variance, we were able to quantify the different components of variation in Chl-a. We found that space and time components combined explained 55.9% of the total variation in Chl-a (35.6% for space and 20.3% for time), while the space x time interaction component explained 44.1% of the variation. The spatial pattern revealed relatively low Chl-a in headwater lakes to higher Chl-a in lower reaches of watersheds. Only a minority of lakes were found to have a temporal trend in Chl-a; some lakes displayed positive trends while others displayed negative trends. The trends were substantial enough to indicate changes in trophic states (that is, oligotrophic lakes becoming eutrophic, or vice versa). These spatial and temporal patterns indicate the complex interactions of local and regional catchment characteristics and lake-specific properties that filter the response of northern lakes to climate change. The large proportion of the space x time interaction component shows the importance of processes occurring within lakes that affect water mixing and nutrient concentrations and therefore availability of the nutrients to phytoplankton.

TI  - Long term variation of evapotranspiration and water balance based on upscaling eddy covariance observations over the temperate semi-arid grassland of China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of global semi-arid grassland, adequately understanding the spatio-temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) and water balance (WB, defined as precipitation-ET) over the temperate semi-arid grassland of China (TSGC) could advance our understanding of climate, hydrological and ecological processes over global semi-arid areas. Based on the largest number of in-situ ET measurements (13 flux towers) within the TSGC, we applied the support vector regression (SVR) method to develop a high-quality ET dataset for the TSGC from 1982 to 2015. The model performed well in validation against flux tower-measured data and comparison with water-balance derived ET. The annual ET ranged from 226 to 294 mm yr(-1) with an average of 250 mm yr(-1) and an insignificant trend during 1982-2015. Nevertheless, ET increased significantly during 1982-1998, and turn to decrease during 1999-2011. Regional WB, which approximately represents water availability, fluctuated without a significant trend for entire period. But the annual mean WB at 1999-2011 decreased by 26.1% compared with that before 1998. On average, ET was dominated by climatic factors, especially precipitation, rather than human activities. The reversal of ET trend after 1998 was predominantly explained by the slow increase of precipitation, the stalled increase of temperature, and the significantly decreasing radiation. The revegetation programs exacerbated the evaporative water consumption significantly in some areas after 1998, such as Yellow River Basin. The variation of WB was mainly driven by precipitation, whether in time or space. In addition, the spatio-temporal difference between our SVR ET dataset with four widely used global ET datasets (i.e., GLEAM, FLUXCOM, MODIS, and BESS) suggested that none of these four products can capture both the magnitude and variability of ET well in the TSGC, and local observations are of great importance.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Primary forests, defined here as forests where the signs of human impacts, if any, are strongly blurred due to decades without forest management, are scarce in Europe and continue to disappear. Despite these losses, we know little about where these forests occur. Here, we present a comprehensive geodatabase and map of Europe's known primary forests. Our geodatabase harmonizes 48 different, mostly field-based datasets of primary forests, and contains 18,411 individual patches (41.1 Mha) spread across 33 countries. When available, we provide information on each patch (name, location, naturalness, extent and dominant tree species) and the surrounding landscape (biogeographical regions, protection status, potential natural vegetation, current forest extent). Using Landsat satellite-image time series (1985-2018) we checked each patch for possible disturbance events since primary forests were identified, resulting in 94% of patches free of significant disturbances in the last 30 years. Although knowledge gaps remain, ours is the most comprehensive dataset on primary forests in Europe, and will be useful for ecological studies, and conservation planning to safeguard these unique forests.

TI  - Sexological Worldview Development Explained by the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sexological worldview is the lens through which someone sees and makes meaning of the sexual world around them. The Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) may be a useful tool in operationalizing cultural humility and responsiveness to sexological differences. This research explored whether the DMIS explains the stages of someone's sexological worldview development across a continuum of dualist to relativist perspectives and ways of interacting with others who are similar or different. The lead author interviewed 30 sexuality professionals and students in the US and found that the participants' sexological worldview development could be explained using the DMIS framework. We discuss the use of the DMIS for the future design of Sexuality Attitudes Reassessment (SAR) programs, a type of training required in the credentialing of sexologists, and the measurement of SAR training outcomes as they pertain to cultural humility and responsiveness. Future research should focus on the development of an empirical instrument to measure sexological worldview development and SAR educators should create new, or align existing, training activities to match their SAR participants' worldview development.

TI  - Reconstructing Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies Using Satellite Data to Evaluate Water Resource Shortages from 1980 to 2016 in the Inland Yongding River Basin, China
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources in the Yongding River basin (YRB) are one of the important fundamental conditions in supporting regional water conservation and ecological development. However, the historical changes in water resources under recent human activities remain unknown due to very limited observation data. In this study, terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) as well as multiple precipitation and actual evapotranspiration products from satellites were collected, and the accuracy of the data was verified by observed data or pairwise comparisons. The TWSA during 1980-2016 was reconstructed by using the water balance method, and the reconstructed TWSA was verified using GRACE-observed TWSA, the average depth to groundwater in the Beijing Plain from historical document records and the observed runoff from Guanting Reservoir. The reconstructed TWSA data indicated that the significant decrease occurred during 2000-2016 and the average rate of decreasing trend was -11 mm/year, which may have been caused by a decrease in groundwater storage due to agricultural development. However, the reconstructed TWSA decreased slightly during 1980-1999. The establishment of the water storage deficit index (WSDI) showed that there was no drought or mild drought during 1980-1999; however, the water resource shortage during 2000-2016 was more serious due to groundwater storage decreases caused by agricultural development. The WSDI was verified by using the commonly used self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index. The findings are valuable for sustainable water resource management in the YRB.

TI  - Association of Limited In-Person Attendance in US National Football League and National Collegiate Athletic Association Games With County-Level COVID-19 Cases
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE In 2020 and early 2021, the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) opted to host football games in stadiums across the country. The in-person attendance of games varied with time and from county to county. There is currently no evidence on whether limited in-person attendance of games is associated with COVID-19 case numbers on a county-level.OBJECTIVE To assess whether NFL and NCAA football games with limited in-person attendance were associated with increased COVID-19 cases in the counties they were held compared with a matched set of counties.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this time-series cross-sectional study, every county hosting NFL or NCAA games with in-person attendance (treated group) in 2020 and 2021 was matched with a county that that did not host a game on the corresponding day but had an identical game history for up to 14 days prior (control group). A standard matching method was used to further refine this matched set so that the treated and matched control counties had similar population size, nonpharmaceutical interventions in place, and COVID-19 trends. The association of hosting games with in-person attendance with COVID-19 cases was assessed using a difference-in-difference estimator. Data were analyzed from August 29 to December 28, 2020.EXPOSURES Hosting NFL or NCAA games. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was estimation of new COVID-19 cases per 100 000 residents at the county level reported up to 14 days after a game among counties with NFL and NCAA games with in-person attendance.RESULTS A total of 528 games with in-person attendance (101 NFL games [19.1%]; 427 NCAA games [80.9%]) were included. The matching algorithm returned 361 matching sets of counties. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of attendance for NFL games was 9949 (6000 to 13 797) people. The median number of attendance for NCAA games was not available, and attendance was recorded as a binary variable. The median (IQR) daily new COVID-19 cases in treatment group counties hosting games was 26.14 (10.77-50.25) cases per 100 000 residents on game day. The median (IQR) daily new COVID-19 cases in control group counties where no games were played was 24.11 (9.64-48.55) cases per 100 000 residents on game day. The treatment effect size ranged from -5.17 to 4.72, with a mean (SD) of 1.21 (2.67) cases per 100 000 residents, within the 14-day period in all counties hosting the games, and the daily treatment effect trend remained relatively steady during this period.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study did not find a consistent increase in the daily COVID-19 cases per 100 000 residents in counties where NFL and NCAA games were held with limited in-person attendance. These findings suggest that NFL and NCAA football games hosted with limited in-person attendance were not associated with substantial risk for increased local COVID-19 cases.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations in particulate organic carbon in Indonesian waters over two decades
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) is one of the essential variables in oceanic biogeochemical processes. Assessing the spatiotemporal variability of POC will help deepen our understanding of the carbon cycle. In this study we collected moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite data for surface POC in Indonesian waters during the period 2002-21, together with in situ data from the south-western Sumatran waters (SSW), Sunda Strait, Sumba-Savu waters and the Halmahera Sea and surrounds. These data were analysed to gain an understanding of the spatial and temporal variations in POC. Generally, high POC concentrations in Indonesian waters were found at coastal and continental shelves connected to the estuaries of large rivers; we assume that the POC concentrations in these areas are affected by terrestrial input. Meanwhile, in Indonesian waters apart from these estuaries, marine-derived materials are the main components of POC. The seasonal pattern of POC in Indonesian waters generally shows highest levels during the south-east monsoon and lowest levels during the north-west monsoon. Trends in POC concentrations are positively correlated with chlorophyll-a and negatively correlated with sea surface temperature. This study suggests that the combination of natural physicochemical processes and anthropogenic perturbations has significant effects on spatial and temporal variations in POC in Indonesian waters.

TI  - High Endothelial Venules: A Vascular Perspective on Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - High endothelial venules (HEVs) are specialized postcapillary venules composed of cuboidal blood endothelial cells that express high levels of sulfated sialomucins to bind L-Selectin/CD62L on lymphocytes, thereby facilitating their transmigration from the blood into the lymph nodes (LN) and other secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). HEVs have also been identified in human and murine tumors in predominantly CD3(+)T cell-enriched areas with fewer CD20(+)B-cell aggregates that are reminiscent of tertiary lymphoid-like structures (TLS). While HEV/TLS areas in human tumors are predominantly associated with increased survival, tumoral HEVs (TU-HEV) in mice have shown to foster lymphocyte-enriched immune centers and boost an immune response combined with different immunotherapies. Here, we discuss the current insight into TU-HEV formation, function, and regulation in tumors and elaborate on the functional implication, opportunities, and challenges of TU-HEV formation for cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Refined algorithm for forest early warning system with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR data in tropical forest regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an automatic change detection method for near real-time (NRT) forest monitoring in tropical re-gions is described. L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR HH, HV, and HH/HV ratio were used to detect various deforestation stages based on their different radar scattering characteristics. The three main stages considered in this approach were as follows: (1) forest was cut, and felled trees were left on the ground, (2) felled trees were burned, and (3) felled (and burned) trees were removed. Two types of forest fires occurred in tropical rain forests and dry and open forests were considered. Multi-temporal data and image normalization techniques are used to suppress commission errors induced by the effects of seasonality and rainfall. Detection accuracies were eval-uated at 11 validation sites distributed over various forest types in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The user's and producer's accuracies of the proposed forest monitoring algorithm were estimated to be 85.0% and 63.8%, respectively. An additional broader performance assessment using data from 191 sites showed an esti-mated total user's accuracy of 71.1%. The results indicate that detection accuracies depend on temporal se-quences, with slower, gradual transitions from forest to other land cover hampering detection performance. The developed algorithm is used in the JICA-JAXA Forest Early Warning System in the tropics (JJ-FAST), which provides forest change information for 77 countries every 42 days under all weather conditions. The NRT alert products are freely available from the JJ-FAST website 3-4 days after PALSAR-2 observation.

TI  - Introducing the MISR level 2 near real-time aerosol product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols are an important element of Earth's climate system and have significant impacts on the environment and on human health. Global aerosol modeling has been increasingly used for operational forecasting and as support for decision making. For example, aerosol analyses and forecasts are routinely used to provide air quality information and alerts in both civilian and military applications. The growing demand for operational aerosol forecasting calls for additional observational data that can be assimilated into models to improve model accuracy and predictive skill. These factors have motivated the development, testing, and release of a new near real-time (NRT) level 2 (L2) aerosol product from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra platform. The NRT product capitalizes on the unique attributes of the MISR aerosol retrieval approach and product contents, such as reliable aerosol optical depth as well as aerosol microphysical information. Several modifications are described that allow for rapid product generation within a 3 h window following acquisition of the satellite observations. Implications for the product quality and consistency are discussed and compared to the current operational L2 MISR aerosol product. Several ways of implementing additional use-specific retrieval screenings are also highlighted. Copyright statement. (C) 2021 California Institute of Technology. Government sponsorship acknowledged.

TI  - Estimating high-spatial resolution surface daily longwave radiation from the instantaneous Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) longwave radiation product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, time extension methods, originally designed for clear-sky land surface conditions, are used to estimate high-spatial resolution surface daily longwave (LW) radiation from the instantaneous Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) longwave radiation product. The performance of four time methods were first tested by using ground based flux measurements that were collected from 141 global sites. Combined with the accuracy of daily LW radiation estimated from the instantaneous GLASS LW radiation, the linear sine interpolation method performs better than the other methods and was employed to estimate the daily LW radiation as follows: The bias/Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the linear sine interpolation method were -6.30/15.10 W/m(2) for the daily longwave upward radiation (LWUP), -1.65/27.63 W/m(2) for the daily longwave downward radiation (LWDN), and 4.69/26.42 W/m(2) for the daily net longwave radiation (LWNR). We found that the lengths of the diurnal cycle of LW radiation are longer than the durations between sunrise and sunset and we proposed increasing the day length by 1.5 h. The accuracies of daily LW radiation were improved after adjusting the day length. The bias/RMSE were -4.15/13.74 W/m(2) for the daily LWUP, -1.3/27.52 W/m(2) for the daily LWDN, and 2.85/25.91 W/m(2) for the daily LWNR. We are producing long-term surface daily LW radiation values from the GLASS LW radiation product.

TI  - Lineament mapping in the Ikniouen area (Eastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco) using Landsat-8 Oli and SRTM data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work focuses on the use of remote sensing techniques and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), to Automatic extraction and geospatial analysis of lineaments, in the district of Ikniouen located in the eastern Moroccan Anti Atlas. To achieve this objective, we relied on the processing of Landsat-8 OLI spectral bands and SRTM data covering the study site. In the first instance, essential pre-processing was carried out on our spatial data for the automatic extraction of lineaments by applying the mathematical algorithm Line Module from PCI' s Geomatica 2016 software. Some of the treatments used included Principal Component Analysis, Shaded relief of SRTM data from different angles, 7 x 7 matrix directional filters, and finally the automatic extraction of lineaments. The results obtained from lineament extraction from the PC1 image, the seven spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m, and the digital elevation models (DEM) SRTM proved that each map produced had a strong similarity in terms of density and orientation with two major directions - NE-SW and E-W - with high densities in areas well known to be fractured, namely the Oussilkane granites in the northeast, the Ikniouen granites in the west, and the rhyolites and ignimbrites of the Amtatouch-Yadawdane formations in the south of the study area. The results from the automatic extraction of the lineaments revealed 2680 lineaments, whose size varied from a few metres to 3.4 km, with an average length of 534 m. The lineaments of small extensions were the most numerous, as they had an interval comprising almost between 30 and 1158 m. The projection of these lineaments on a Rose diagram showed a predominance of the NE-SW direction. Multi-source data, such as lithological factors, slope factors, and calibrated, high-resolution ESRI field imagery basemap, were used to validate potential results of this automatic lineament mapping. The automatic extraction allowed a better mapping of the structural lineaments; it add information to geological data, but the geological meaning of the linear feature have to be investigated. This technique is usefull to preliminary identify areas with a probable difference in potential lineament density together with their main directions.

TI  - Impact of land use/land cover changes on water quality and human health in district Peshawar Pakistan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality and quantity of groundwater resources are affected by landuse/landcover (LULC) dynamics, particularly the increasing urbanization coupled with high household wastewater discharge and decreasing open lands. This study evaluates temporal changes of groundwater quality for 2012 and 2019, its relation to Landuse/landcover, and its impact on Peshawar's residents (study area), Pakistan. A total of 105 and 112 groundwater samples were collected from tube wells in 2012 and 2019. Samples were then analyzed for seven standard water quality parameters (i.e., pH, electric conductivity (EC), turbidity, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and nitrate). Patient data for waterborne diseases were also collected for the years 2012 and 2019 to relate the impact of groundwater quality on human health. Landsat satellite images were classified for the years 2012 and 2019 to observe landuse/landcover dynamics concerning groundwater quality. Results manifested a decrease in groundwater quality for the year 2019 compared to 2012 and were more highlighted in highly populated areas. The nitrate concentration level was found high in the vicinity of agricultural areas due to the excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers and pesticides, and thus the methemoglobinemia patients ratio increased by 14% (48-62% for the year 2012 and 2019, respectively). Besides, Urinary Tract Infections, Peptic Ulcer, and Dental Caries diseases increased due to the high calcium and magnesium concentration. The overall results indicate that anthropogenic activities were the main driver of Spatio-temporal variability in groundwater quality of the study area. The study could help district health administration understand groundwater quality trends, make appropriate site-specific policies, and formulate future health regulations.

TI  - The spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanisation and local climate: A case study of Islamabad, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned urbanisation, together with climate change, are increasingly affecting the local climatic conditions of urban settlements. Spatiotemporal analysis using land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), and local climatic zone (LCZ) assessments have been helpful in understanding the urbanisation characteristics and morphology. Islamabad, the capital and the only planned city of Pakistan, has witnessed a consistent rise in local temperatures, increased built-up areas, and reduced vegetation cover during the past decades. This study explores the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC, LST, and LCZ in Islamabad using satellite remote sensing data and spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The results indicate a whopping increase in a built-up area in the city (113% during 2013 and 2019). A positive correlation between LST and NDBI, whereas a negative correlation between LST and NDVI clearly indicates how urbanisation (and reduction in vegetation cover) are impacting the local temperatures. Assessment and analysis of LCZs helped to understand the variations and deviations of current LULC from the master plan. It was observed that compact low-rise urban development is the most prevalent. The outcomes of this study are expected to inform the urban planners, climatologists, and policymakers with the knowledge helpful for devising climate-resilient development policies that could reduce thermal stresses in the capital cities.

TI  - Can axillary surgery be omitted in patients with breast pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer? A real-world retrospective study in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Studies show that axillary surgery can be potentially omitted in certain breast cancer patients who achieve breast pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). However, potential differences between the ypT0 and ypTis subgroups remain to be explored. Furthermore, whether axillary surgery can be omitted in patients with clinically assessed positive axillary lymph nodes (cN+) remains unknown. This study was to evaluate the status of axillary lymph nodes for patients who achieved breast pCR after NST in the real-world study. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 258 patients with early or locally advanced breast cancer who underwent breast and axillary surgery after NST. Clinical and pathologic data were compared between patients with breast pCR (ypT0/is) and those without breast pCR. Results The rate of breast pCR after NST was 27.1% (70/258). Among the patients with initial cN0, the rate of axillary pCR was similar between the breast pCR and breast non-pCR groups (100% vs. 85.7%, P = 0.1543). Among those with breast pCR, the rate of axillary pCR was 100% in both the ypT0 and ypTis subgroups. Furthermore, among those with initial cN+, the rate of axillary pCR was higher in the breast pCR group than in the breast non-pCR group (82.7% vs. 22.9%, P < 0.0001). Among the patients with breast pCR, the rate of axillary pCR was higher in the ypT0 subgroup than in the ypTis subgroup (94.3% vs. 58.8%, P = 0.0034). Conclusion Axillary surgery may potentially be omitted in patients with initial cN0 who achieve breast pCR (ypT0/is), and may also be considered for omission in patients with initial cN+ who achieve ypT0 (not ypTis).

TI  - Alternative biome states of African terrestrial vegetation and the potential drivers: A continental-scale study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The alternative stable state (ASS) theory provides a plausible framework to explain the spatial distribution of biomes and their dynamics. Existing studies to test the alternative biome states (ABSs) mainly focused on tree-dominated biomes. It is still uncertain whether ABSs are present in a wide range of terrestrial biomes. This study was to examine the ABSs in the terrestrial vegetated areas of Africa and the maintaining factors. The potential landscapes were reconstructed separately for forest, grassland and shrubland using the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field data along the gradients of temperature, precipitation and aridity index (AI, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). The differences of soil organic carbon density (SOCD), fire count and grazing intensity were compared to test the feedback hypothesis to maintain the ABSs. The results showed that AI performed well in detecting the ABSs at the continental scale of Africa. Forest (at the wetter end) and shrubland (at the drier end) were well separated along the AI axis. Forest had three stable states (i.e. closed forest, woody savanna, and savanna) and shrubland had two stable states (i.e. closed shrubland and open shrubland). Grassland had two stable states (i.e. dense grassland and sparse grassland) distributing in a large AI range. The stable states that shared a specific AI range were regarded as the ABSs. Climate aridity greatly determined the distribution of the ABSs but the positive feedbacks between vegetation and SOCD, fire count, and livestock density played potential roles in driving the shifts between the ABSs. Our study indicated that the ABSs commonly existed in varied biomes (both tree-dominated and non-tree dominated) in the African continent, which provided an enlarged picture of the ABSs of the terrestrial biomes. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of large scale vegetation patterns and their dynamics and facilitate to macro management of the terrestrial ecosystems in facing the possible regime shifts of the biomes.

TI  - Social media, socialization, and pursuing legitimation of police violence*
T2  - CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Every day, police departments across America are executing stops, summonses, arrests, and increasingly, tweeting. Although scholarship has focused on how social media democratizes news production and information sharing for activist movements, it has yet to explore how police leverage these attributes to advance institutional interests. I argue that, beyond digital surveillance or community engagement, social media provides police with the technological capacity to pursue both daily socialization of online audiences to their worldview and legitimation in the aftermath of contested police violence. I provide evidence by adopting a qualitative approach to "big data" sources analyzing 1) all 3,167 tweets posted by the New York Police Department in 2018; 2) the 778 Twitter replies to their most contested fatal shooting that year; and 3) a sample of 139 news articles covering this shooting over a year afterward. As public scrutiny toward police intensifies, social media represents an independent channel for police to publicize information unfiltered by traditional mass media. These findings have implications for police accountability and the episodes of police violence that do-and do not-elevate into national controversies.

TI  - Observation of Gravity Waves at the Tropical Tropopause Using Superpressure Balloons
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical gravity wave activity is investigated using measurements of momentum fluxes gathered during Strateole-2 superpressure balloon flights. The data set consists of eight balloon flights performed in the deep tropics from November 2019 to February 2020. The flights lasted for 2-3 months each, and in-situ meteorological data were collected every 30 s. The relation between gravity waves and deep convection is investigated using geostationary satellite data from the NOAA/NCEP GPM_MERGIR satellite data product, at 1 h resolution. The amplitude of gravity wave momentum fluxes shows a clear dependence on the distance to the nearest convective system, with a strong decay as distance to convection increases. The largest momentum-flux values (>5mPa) are only found less than 200 km away from deep convection. The sensitivity of the wave flux to distance from convection is stronger for high frequency gravity waves (periods shorter than 60 min). Lower frequency waves tend to a non-zero, background value away from convection, supporting some background value in gravity-wave drag parameterizations. On the other hand, the wide range of momentum flux values observed close to the convection emphasizes the intermittent nature of the gravity-wave source. The large scale variation of gravity-wave intermittency within the equatorial belt is also studied. The results highlight spatial variations of gravity wave activity, with the highest momentum flux recorded over land.

TI  - Comments on "Study of Systematic Bias in Measuring Surface Deformation With SAR Interferometry''
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In a recent publication, Ansari et al. (2021) claimed (see, in particular, the Discussion and Recommendation Section in their article) that the advanced differential SAR interferometry (InSAR) algorithms for surface deformation retrieval, based on the small baseline approach, are affected by systematic biases in the generated InSAR products. Therefore, to avoid such biases, they recommended a strategy primarily focused on excluding ``the short temporal baseline interferograms and using long baselines to decrease the overall phase errors.'' In particular, among various techniques, Ansari et al. (2021) identified the solution presented by Manunta et al. (2019) as a small baseline advanced InSAR processing approach where the presence of the above-mentioned biases (referred to as a fading signal) compromises the accuracy of the retrieved InSAR deformation products. We show that the claim of Ansari et al. (2021) is not correct (at least) for what concerns the mentioned approach discussed by Manunta et al. (2019). In particular, by processing the Sentinel-1 dataset relevant to the same area in Sicily (southern Italy) investigated by Ansari et al. (2021), we demonstrate that the generated InSAR products do not show any significant bias.

TI  - Examining the meaning of the language used to communicate the nursing hand-off
T2  - RESEARCH IN NURSING & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The miscommunication and inconsistent recall of patient information due to cognitive lapses that occur during the hand-off between healthcare providers account for 80% of sentinel events in acute care. Cognitive lapses are a consequence of the nurse experiencing cognitive overload, which impedes the nurse's ability to recall relevant information during and after the hand-off communication. The primary cognitive and human factor contributing to cognitive overload in the hand-off is language. The purpose of this study was to examine the meaning of the language used to communicate the nurse-to-nurse change of shift hand-off occurring at bedside and nonbedside on a medical-surgical unit in an urban medical center. A qualitative descriptive design was used. The sample was 10 audio-recorded hand-offs (five bedside and five nonbedside), with a total of 19 nurses participating. A natural language process program was used to analyze the data. The hand-off is a narrative story centered on communicating patient information delivered with a high degree of confidence. The hand-off is focused on past and current events with minimal focus on future or anticipated events. The drive to communicate is minimally based on concern, fear, or danger. There is a difference in the language used to communicate the nursing hand-off message at bedside as compared to the nonbedside hand-off.

TI  - Sentinel behavior in captive meerkats (<i>Suricata suricatta</i>)
T2  - ZOO BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The social and cooperative behavior of meerkats (Suricata suricatta), specifically their sentinel behavior, has been intensively studied in free-ranging populations. This study focuses on whether guarding in captive meerkats exhibits a pattern similar to that described for wild groups. Sentinel behavior in captivity has been somewhat neglected because predation is usually not a critical factor. Nonetheless, observations in captivity might reveal whether individual or group experience influences this specific behavior pattern. We observed three captive meerkat groups (in outdoor as well as indoor enclosures) and analyzed the duration of guarding sequences, the number of established guards, the guard posture, and the individual guard positions. We also conducted playback experiments to investigate the reaction of the sentinel and the group to bird calls (songbird vs. predatory bird species). The results demonstrated that captive groups behave much the same as wild groups. Certain individuals performed the guard job more often than other group members. Accordingly, the "super sentinels" observed in the wild also exist in captive groups. Playbacks showed that the sentinels reacted more strongly to the calls of predatory bird species, indicating that captive meerkats are able to categorize bird calls. We also documented major differences in behavioral responses to the calls of specific predatory bird species. Our observations underline that sentinel behavior is probably a combination of an innate, imprinted pattern that is further affected by the experience. Future studies might further investigate this influence of experience, beyond innate behavior, on the group-specific sentinel behavior pattern in captive meerkats.

TI  - Landfill siting for municipal solid waste using remote sensing and geographic information system integrated analytic hierarchy process and simple additive weighting methods from the point of view of a fast-growing metropolitan area in GAP area of Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The site selection process for municipal solid wastes (MSW) plays an important role in environmental impact studies by allowing the use of environmental design criteria in city and country planning. This process also includes the subject of urban planning due to its impact on the economy, ecology, and environmental health of the region. Urban growth is a phenomenon that is difficult to stop or limit in line with environmental, social, and economic changes and development. Therefore, the selection of solid waste landfill is of great importance in terms of ensuring a sustainable urban future. In the study, Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images, base map, soil, and geology maps were used for the integration of geospatial data. Each layer specified in the map has been formed using the spatial analysis potential of the ArcGIS10.5 software. In these digitized layers, weight scoring was made using the comparison matrix and the final suitability map was produced. All digital layers established in the generated maps were arranged according to the analytical hierarchy method (AHP) and subjected to the simple additive weighting (SAW) method. The results indicated that 13.51% of the total area was suitable for a sanitary landfill. As a result of this study, urban growth, population projection, and domestic solid waste volume of Sanliurfa province were determined. According to the 25-year population projection, the population in 2045 was approximately 4,471,938 people, and the cumulative waste volume was 27,415,627 m(3). In addition, as a result of accepting the wastes of three metropolitan districts and seven district municipalities to the sanitary landfill, only "first candidate area" is the most and has been deemed appropriate. Given the ecological and environmental challenges (proximity to the city center, etc.) associated with the existing MSW sanitary landfill facility in Sanliurfa, the results of this study show that the geographic information system (GIS) integrated AHP and SAW method is an effective tool to assist decision makers to properly plan towards achieving a sustainable environment.

TI  - Soil erosion estimation of Bhandara region of Maharashtra, India, by integrated use of RUSLE, remote sensing, and GIS
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural land of the whole world is deteriorating due to the loss of top fertile soil reducing agricultural productivity and groundwater availability. Mainly, natural conditions and human manipulations have made soils extremely prone to soil erosion. Therefore, information on soil erosion status is of paramount importance to the policymakers for land conservation planning in a limited time. Spatial information systems like GIS and RS are known for their efficiencies. With that prospect, the GIS-based RUSLE model is used in this study to assess the soil erosion losses from Bhandara regions of Maharashtra, India. The study area comes under Wainganga sub-river basin, a portion of the Godavari River basin. We have prepared the required five potential parameters (R*K*LS*C*P) of RUSLE model on pixel-to-pixel basis. We have prepared the R factor map from monthly rainfall data of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and K factor map by digital the soil series map of NBSS & LUP, Govt. of India. We have used the digital elevation model data (DEM) of Cartosat-1 for LS-factor map, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A satellite dataset to generate LULC and NDVI map to obtain C and P factors. The results and satellite data were validated using Google Earth Pro and field observations. The results showed significant soil erosion from the river banks and wastelands near water bodies, with the soil loss values ranging between 20 and 40 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The land under reserved forest was very slight erosion-prone soil with soil loss of < 5 t ha(-1) yr(-1), but few water bodies in forest land have resulted in more than 40 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Some steep sloppy land near the riverbank showed soil erosion loss ranging from 44.37 to 241.03 t ha(-1) yr(-1) due to higher water forces, most minor vegetation, high steep slopes, and sandy loam soils. The spatial techniques used for assessing soil erosion in the study area will be helpful for decision-makers and planners to take appropriate land management measures to counter the soil loss and protect the natural environment. Thus, the GIS-based RUSLE model is a convenient, time-efficient, and cost-effective tool to evaluate and map soil erosion on a pixel-to-pixel basis.

M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the relationship between social support and psychological variables, and investigated the status of social support among villagers whose evacuation order had been lifted. The survey used for the analysis is the data of FY 2018 and 2019. In fiscal year 2018, a written questionnaire was posted to 4828 registered residents of Iitate Village and 1405 valid responses were received. The main finding (in joint assessment by local and external experts) was the 'need for professional support' (191 respondents, 13.6%). Multivariate analysis found that among those living in permanent housing outside the village, the need for support was significantly more likely for those without emotional support, or instrumental support, and those not providing support. The 2019 follow-up showed a slight improvement in perceived social support (PSS). The associations between perceived social support and living environment suggest the need to strengthen social support measures in areas where evacuation orders are yet to be lifted, which will provide useful information with which to examine the effects of future support efforts.

TI  - Evaluation of Parametric and Nonparametric Algorithms for the Estimation of Suspended Particulate Matter in Turbid Water using Gaofen-1 Wide Field-of-view Sensors
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the concentration of suspended particulate matter (C-SPM) is necessary for the evaluation of the ecological processes, matter transfer, and environments in lakes. Traditional monitoring via the use of field measurements lacks the spatial coverage necessary for detailed analysis in large-area lakes. In contrast, the macroscopic, real-time monitoring of C-SPM can be achieved using data from remote-sensing satellites. Due to the major limitations of the existing analytical and semi-analytical algorithms, namely the lake locations and limited data, regression algorithms have become important tools for the analysis of the C-SPM values in lakes. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of both parametric and nonparametric regression algorithms for C-SPM estimation based on the simulation of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field-of-view (WFV) satellites for the imaging of turbid water. A total of 71 samples collected during four cruises were analyzed to determine the spectral reflectance and C-SPM in Poyang Lake. The results indicate that the spectral ratio (SR) parametric regression model and the extreme learning machine (ELM) nonparametric regression model based on in situ SPM and spectral data perform relatively better than the other investigated models. A SR fitting model using band3 (lambda = 660 nm)/band2 (lambda = 555 nm) of the GF-1 WFV sensor was established to estimate the C-SPM value. The evaluation results indicate that the SR model achieved a high retrieval accuracy (R-2 = 0.901, RMSE = 8.22 mg center dot L-1); this is because the model was more sensitive and could effectively weaken, and even partially eliminate, the effects of external factors. The ELM model achieved a higher retrieval accuracy (R-2 = 0.903, RMSE = 8.05 mg center dot L-1) than the other neural network-based algorithms, namely the backpropagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF), and cascade-forward neural network (CFNN) algorithms. The ELM model is well suited for both low and high turbidity, and has a robust ability to accurately retrieve the C-SPM value. In Poyang Lake, the C-SPM values were found to have a spatial characteristic and were higher in the northern waters than in the southern waters. Overall, this study demonstrates the applicability of GF-1 WFV sensors with an advanced spatial resolution and an increased spectral sensitivity for monitoring the C-SPM values in high-turbidity water, and the ELM model is recommended for application to GF-1 images to satisfactorily produce quantitative C-SPM maps.

TI  - Spatiotemporal land use change and environmental degradation surrounding CAFOs in Michigan and North Carolina
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) have arisen and expanded in the U.S. and globally to address efficiencies in livestock production. CAFOs tend to cluster in space for logistical purposes. Efficient distribution of concentrated manures produced by these operations is often not economically feasible, which may lead to accumulation on land near CAFOs, potentially resulting in local environmental changes. Moreover, as CAFOs are established or expand, they may need more lands to apply their manures, likely driving land use changes even after their establishment. Studies have yet to investigate these spatiotemporal impacts of CAFOs. We investigated whether the presence of regulated liquid waste CAFOs is associated with land use change over time and space as well as degraded environmental conditions surrounding those facilities. We used MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) images from 2000 to 2018 to examine these questions in Michigan and North Carolina states with varied CAFO establishment histories. We found that cropland extent increased while savanna and forest decreased near CAFOs. Similar observations did not occur outside of areas influenced by CAFOs. We also found evidence of environmental degradation, including decreased evapotranspiration and increased day and nighttime land surface temperatures in North Carolina. This study advances our understanding of environmental impacts surrounding CAFOs. Our findings can support policy changes and highlight the need to better understand these globally increasing entities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGING & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a lifespan perspective, we investigated a neglected aspect of research on religion, namely, whether perceptions of growth from adversity might strengthen religious worldviews, thus accounting for feelings about one's own death in old age. A directed content analysis of in-depth interviews from 16 adults aged 65+ focused on life events, religious worldviews, and death. Findings suggested that participants' religious worldview beliefs were associated with positive reinterpretation of lifespan adversities such that stressors functioned as opportunities for spiritual growth. Participants' views of and beliefs about death were without fear, indicating the potential influence of highly individualized and deeply spiritual religious worldview beliefs on the abatement of death fear.

TI  - GRACE-FO and ECOSTRESS Synergies Constrain Fine-Scale Impacts on the Water Balance
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate evapotranspiration (ET) measurement over large scales with remote sensing can contribute to effective water resource management. However, ET measurement is challenging, particularly in complex agricultural landscapes. ET calculated with the water balance method using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)/GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions has been found to exceed estimates from land surface models, although there has been no definitive explanation. Here, we show using high resolution ET from ECOSTRESS, that this bias is attributed to fine-scale irrigation not captured by models but which mass conservation detects. The percentage of irrigated area scales linearly with the bias between observed and modeled ET (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.01). We estimate that irrigation accounts for 35% of ET during the irrigated summer months in arid/semi-arid basins in North America. This study presents the synergies of using GRACE-FO and ECOSTRESS to improve remote sensing of agricultural water use.

TI  - Remote sensing of spectral diversity: A new methodological approach to account for spatio-temporal dissimilarities between plant communities
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of remote sensing data allows the quantification of biodiversity in space and time. In particular, spectral diversity, defined as the variability of electromagnetic radiation reflected from plants, can be assessed with remote sensing. Plant traits vary diurnally and seasonally due to plant phenology and land man-agement. This results in strong temporal variation of spectral diversity, which cannot be accurately represented by remotely sensed data collected at a single point in time. However, knowledge of how datasets sampled at multiple points in time should best be used to quantify spectral diversity is scarce. To address this issue, we first introduced a new approach using spatio-temporal spectral diversity based on the dissimilarity measure Rao's quadratic entropy index (RaoQ). Thereby, we demonstrated how RaoQ can be used to partition the total spectral diversity of a region (gamma SD) into additive alpha (alpha SD, within communities) and spatio-temporal beta (beta SD; between communities) components, allowing the calculation of beta SD from community mean spectral features, in-dependent from alpha SD. Second, we illustrated our methodological approach with a case study in which beta SD is calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite data at high temporal resolution for managed grasslands which differ across a large gradient of environmental properties. We were able to show differences in beta SD and separate its components into phenological and management effects. Furthermore, the contribution of different plant communities to beta SD was assessed, and the results were validated against a dataset of in-situ measured beta diversity from plant surveys. Compared to spatial dissimilarities from distinct stages of the growing season, using spatio-temporal dissimi-larities between communities produced a more accurate estimation of the uniqueness of a community. This study shows how to account for temporal variations in the spectral diversity of plant communities and demonstrates that this improves the estimation of plant biodiversity through remote sensing. Spectral diversity in space and time makes it possible to assess mechanisms that drive biodiversity and identify plant communities relevant for conservation purposes.

TI  - Increase in CO<sub>2</sub> Uptake Capacity in the Arctic Chukchi Sea During Summer Revealed by Satellite-Based Estimation
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity of CO2 uptake in the Chukchi Sea is particularly sensitive to rapid physical and biological changes. However, scarce field observations pose a challenge in understanding the long-term trend of CO2 uptake capacity on this continental shelf. We adopted a machine-learning-based approach to construct a 17-years (2003-2019) long-term time series of summer sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) from remote sensing products. We show that the long-term increase in CO2 uptake capacity can be attributed to strong and enhanced biological uptake. In addition, the intraseasonal variability of surface pCO(2) in early summer confirms the crucial role of sea ice melt and the subsequently enhanced photosynthesis as soon as the surface ocean converts into an open system. Our results thus highlight the use of remote sensing data in interpolating/extrapolating the highly dynamic carbonate system in the continental shelf sea and shed light into future studies involving machine learning or algorithms.

TI  - Characterization of Nadir Echoes in Multiple-Elevation-Beam SAR With Constant and Variable Pulse Repetition Interval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple-elevation-beam synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a concept based on digital beamforming (DBF) in elevation and simultaneous recording of the echoes of multiple transmitted pulses. It enables high-resolution imaging of wide areas and is therefore ideal for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. Furthermore, if the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is continuously varied (staggered SAR), it is possible to map a wide continuous swath rather than multiple subswaths separated by ``blind'' ranges. Within the design of multiple-elevation-beam SAR, however, it is fundamental to consider how nadir echoes affect the mapping capabilities of systems with constant PRI and the image quality of staggered SAR systems, where nadir echoes are intrinsically smeared due to the PRI variation. This article addresses the characterization of nadir echoes in multiple-elevation-beam SAR with constant and variable PRI by presenting a parametric model for the nadir echo profile based on real radar measurements, a formulation of the nadir echo location and smearing in staggered SAR, and realistic simulations based on TerraSAR-X data, which show that nadir echo are likely to be barely visible in staggered SAR images. The results of this work are relevant to both the design of future SAR systems and the interpretation of the acquired data.

TI  - Improved Anthropogenic SO<sub>2</sub> Retrieval from High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite and its Application during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) measured by satellites is widely used to estimate anthropogenic emissions. The Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) operational SO2 product is overestimated compared to the ground-based multiaxis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in China and shows an opposite variation to the surface measurements, which limits the application of TROPOspheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) products in emissions research. Radiometric calibration, a priori profiles, and fitting windows might cause the overestimation of S-5P operational SO2 product. Here, we improve the optimal-estimation-based algorithm through several calibration methods. The improved retrieval agrees reasonably well with the ground-based measurements (R > 0.70, bias <13.7%) and has smaller biases (-28.9%) with surface measurements over China and India. It revealed that the SO2 column in March 2020 decreased by 51.6% compared to March 2019 due to the lockdown for curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there was a decrease of 50% during the lockdown than those after the lockdown, similar to the surface measurement trend, while S-5P operational SO2 product showed an unrealistic increase of 19%. In India, the improved retrieval identified obvious "hot spots" and observed a 30% decrease of SO2 columns during the lockdown.

TI  - Impact of High Temporal Resolution FY-4A Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) Radiance Measurements on Typhoon Forecasts: Maria (2018) Case With GRAPES Global 4D-Var Assimilation System
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Targeted observations for Typhoon Maria (2018) using the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) at a temporal resolution of 15 min provide unprecedented information for impact studies of high-temporal-resolution from geostationary hyperspectral IR sounders. This study investigates the impacts of different temporal resolutions for GIIRS assimilation on Maria analyses and forecasts. Results reveal that assimilating higher resolution data captures more detailed temporal and spatial structures and stronger warm anomalies. Additionally, the track forecast for Maria from assimilating higher temporal resolution GIIRS radiances is better than those from assimilating radiances with lower temporal resolution, and both are better than the control experiment. The accuracy of the different temporal resolutions GIIRS experiments (from 3 h to 15 min) is improved (from 18% to 43%), and the intensity forecast errors are also reduced (from 12% to 18%). Meanwhile, high-temporal GIIRS assimilation also improves the coastal precipitation forecasts during typhoon landfall.

TI  - Retrieving dynamics of the surface water extent in the upper reach of Yellow River
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-time scale surface water extent (SWE) dynamics are very important to understand climate change impacts on water resources. With Landsat 5/7/8 images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), an improved threshold-based water extraction algorithm and a novel surface water gaps (SWGs) interpolation method based on historical water frequency were applied to build surface water area (SWA, namely SWE without ice) and water body area (WBA. namely SWE with ice) monthly (January 2001-December 2019) and annual (1986-2019) time series in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (UYR). The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyse SWE trends, and the ridge regression was performed to figure out the relative contributions of meteorological factors to SWE dynamics. The pixels with modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) higher than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as SWE. The mean relative error (MRE) of the SWGs interpolation results was below 10%. At the annual scale, the average SWA and number of lakes over 1 ha showed significant upward trends of 4.4 km(2) yr(-1) and 7.53 yr(-1), respectively. The monthly WBA increased in summer and autumn while decreased in spring and winter. The maximum freezing and thawing ratios were 53.74% in December and 37.32% in May, respectively. Attribution analysis showed that precipitation and wind speed were the foremost factors dominating the dynamics of annual SWA and monthly WBA, respectively. Our findings confirmed that climatic changes have altered the dynamics of water bodies in the UYR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - MODIS-FIRMS and ground-truthing-based wildfire likelihood mapping of Sikkim Himalaya using machine learning algorithms
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in limited extent and intensity can be a boon for the forest ecosystem. However, recent episodes of wildfires of 2019 in Australia and Brazil are sad reminders of their heavy ecological and economical costs. Understanding the role of environmental factors in the likelihood of wildfires in a spatial context would be instrumental in mitigating it. In this study, 15 environmental features encompassing meteorological, topographical, ecological, in situ and anthropogenic factors have been considered for preparing the wildfire likelihood map of Sikkim Himalaya. A comparative study on the efficiency of machine learning methods like Generalized Linear Model, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) has been performed to identify the best performing algorithm in wildfire prediction. The study indicates that all the machine learning methods are good at predicting wildfires. However, RF has outperformed, followed by GBM in the prediction. Also, environmental features like average temperature, average wind speed, proximity to roadways and tree cover percentage are the most important determinants of wildfires in Sikkim Himalaya. This study can be considered as a decision support tool for preparedness, efficient resource allocation and sensitization of people towards mitigation of wildfires in Sikkim.

TI  - Therapeutic neck dissection in head and neck melanoma patients: Comparing extent of surgery and clinical outcome in two cohorts
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The extent of surgical management of regional lymph nodes in the treatment of cutaneous head and neck melanoma on and anterior to O'Brien's watershed line is controversial. By comparing patients' cohorts of two separate melanoma expert centers we investigate the effectiveness of comprehensive versus (super-) selective neck dissection approach.Methods: Sixty patients with macroscopic (palpable) neck node metastases (N2b) from anterior scalp and face melanoma were retrospectively studied. Forty therapeutic modified radical neck dissections (MRND; levels I-V) combined with elective parotidectomy from The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NCI) were compared with 16 (super-) selective neck dissections [(S)SND; 3-4 levels] and 4 solely MRNDs from Erasmus Medical Center (EMC). Cohorts were analyzed for site of recurrence, overall survival (OS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and disease-free survival (DFS).Results: Clinical characteristics of patients were equal in both groups. In the NCI cohort 62.5% (n = 25) of patients recurred versus 65% (n = 13) in the EMC cohort. None of the NCI recurrences affected the parotid gland in contrast to 3 patients in the EMC group. Survival characteristics were not different between the two groups: OS (p = 0.56), MSS (p = 0.98), DFS (p = 0.92).Conclusion: This study does not support to continue the practice of routine elective parotidectomy and MRND in melanoma patients undergoing a lymph node dissection for macroscopic (palpable) nodal disease and justifies (S)SND.

TI  - The worse survival outcomes reported for melanoma patients having sentinel node biopsy after lymphoscintigraphy the previous day do not appear to be due to overnight migration of Tc99m-nanocolloid tracer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: It has been reported that the survival of patients having sentinel node (SN) biopsy for melanoma the day after lymphoscintigraphy using Tc99m-nanocolloid is worse than that of patients having lymphoscintigraphy and SN biopsy on the same day [1,2]. A possible explanation suggested is that overnight migration of the tracer from SNs to 2nd-tier nodes occurs, causing failure to remove true SNs. Materials and methods: The possibility of overnight tracer migration leading to errors in SN-identification was investigated in 12 patients scheduled for lymphoscintigraphy the day before surgery by repeating SPECT-CT imaging the next morning, before their SN biopsy. The aim was to check whether onward migration of colloid from previously-identified SNs had occurred. Results: No significant migration of Tc99m-nanocolloid occurred overnight in any patient. All nodes reported to be SNs on day 1 imaging were also present and regarded as SNs on day 2 images. No new foci were visualised on day 2, but some that had been identified on day 1 were not seen on day 2. Conclusions: Since migration of nanocolloid overnight did not occur, this cannot explain the reported survival disadvantage for patients undergoing SN biopsy the day after lymphoscintigraphy. A likely alternative possibility is that inadequate doses of radioisotope were used for next-day procedures, causing the mistaken removal of 2nd-tier nodes instead of true SNs more frequently. Further research is required to explain the reported reduction in survival of patients having next-day SN biopsy procedures, since the possibility has important clinical implications.

TI  - Retrospective review of sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer using indocyanine green and near infra-red fluorescence imaging during minimally invasive surgery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: To determine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in early-stage endometrial cancer and to evaluate the impact of the SLN result on adjuvant therapy prescription. Materials and methods: 140 women with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer, treated with a minimally invasive hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and SLN mapping were included. All mapped SLNs were confirmed by histopathology. Where the SLN was negative on H&E staining, ultra-staging with IHC was performed. Results: From January 2017 to May 2019, 122 patients were analysed. The overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 86% (105/122) and 73% (89/122), respectively. The detection rates were not significantly different between low and high-risk disease. SLN metastasis was found in 15% (3/20) of patients the in high-risk group and 5.7% (5/87) in the low-risk group. Six of the 8 cases were identified by ultra-staging. Fourteen of 103 patients had their adjuvant treatment reduced based on SLN status after ultra-staging. Conclusion: SLN mapping can reliably detect the SLN in low and high-risk disease. The advantage for SLN mapping is in low-risk patients that allowed them to receive appropriate adjuvant therapy. Ultra-staging with IHC increased the detection of positive SLNs and decreased the prescribed adjuvant therapy in 14% of our patients.

TI  - Soil Sensors-Based Prediction System for Plant Diseases Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diseases cause losses to agricultural production and hence, the economy. This necessitates a need to develop prediction models for the plant disease detection and assessment. Fungal infection, the most dominant disease, can be controlled by taking appropriate measures if detected at an early stage. The article aims to develop an expert system for the prediction of various fungal diseases (powdery mildew, anthracnose, rust, and root rot/leaf blight). A multi-layered perceptron model is used for the classification of the diseases which not only detects the plant diseases effectively but can also increase the production drastically. The proposed technique incorporates three significant steps of dataset pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and detection module. Firstly, the real-time data is captured by the soil sensors system installed at agriculture field at Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University, Gujarat, India, along with the satellite data for other micro-meteorological factors. Next, an extensive exploratory data analysis has been performed to get insights into the collected data. Finally, the proposed machine learning model has been employed to predict plant diseases. The experimental results indicate that the model outperforms several existing methods in terms of accuracy. Average accuracy in predicting each disease has been found more than 98%. This work also proves the feasibility of using this technique for faster plant disease detection at an affordable cost.

TI  - A laboratory for conceiving Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs)-The 'Data pool initiative for the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem'
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of climate change-induced events on forest ecosystem dynamics of composition, function and structure call for increased long-term, interdisciplinary and integrated research on biodiversity indicators, in particular within strictly protected areas with extensive non-intervention zones. The long-established concept of forest supersites generally relies on long-term funds from national agencies and goes beyond the logistic and financial capabilities of state- or region-wide protected area administrations, universities and research institutes. We introduce the concept of data pools as a smaller-scale, user-driven and reasonable alternative to co-develop remote sensing and forest ecosystem science to validated products, biodiversity indicators and management plans. We demonstrate this concept with the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem Data Pool, which has been established as an interdisciplinary, international data pool within the strictly protected Bavarian Forest and Sumava National Parks and currently comprises 10 active partners. We demonstrate how the structure and impact of the data pool differs from comparable cases. We assessed the international influence and visibility of the data pool with the help of a systematic literature search and a brief analysis of the results. Results primarily suggest an increase in the impact and visibility of published material during the life span of the data pool, with highest visibilities achieved by research conducted on leaf traits, vegetation phenology and 3D-based forest inventory. We conclude that the data pool results in an efficient contribution to the concept of global biodiversity observatory by evolving towards a training platform, functioning as a pool of data and algorithms, directly communicating with management for implementation and providing test fields for feasibility studies on earth observation missions.

TI  - Breast Cancer Treatment
T2  - AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, and the second most common cause of death from cancer in women in the United States. Risk assessment tools can identify the risk of breast cancer, and patients at high risk may be candidates for risk-reducing medications. The choice of medication varies with menopausal status. Breast cancer treatment depends on the stage. Stage 0 is ductal carcinoma in situ, which is noninvasive but progresses to invasive cancer in up to 40% of patients. Ductal carcinoma in situ is treated with lumpectomy and radiation or with mastectomy. If ductal carcinoma in situ is estrogen receptor positive, patients may also receive endocrine therapy. Early invasive stages (I, Ila, lIb) and locally advanced stages (111a, 111b, 111c) are nonmetastatic and have three treatment phases. The preoperative phase uses systemic endocrine or immunotherapies when tumors express estrogen, progesterone, or ERBB2 receptors. Preoperative chemotherapy may also be used and is the only option when tumors have none of those three receptors. There are two options for the surgical phase with similar survival rates; a lumpectomy with radiation if the tumor can be excised completely with good cosmetic results, or a mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is also performed when there is suspected nodal disease. The postoperative phase includes radiation, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women should also be offered postoperative bisphosphonates. Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Treatment goals include improving the length and quality of life. Copyright (C) 2021 American Academy of Family Physicians.

TI  - Predicting soil organic carbon by integrating Landsat 8 OLI, GIS and data mining techniques in semi-arid region
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important indicator for soil quality and environmental health. It also plays a key role in the semi-arid region. The aims of this study were to derive models for SOC prediction using Landsat 8 OLI data in dry and wet months of a semi-arid region. To this end, the SOC contents were measured in 165 points from agricultural soils (0-15 cm depth) based on a stratified random sampling method. The measured data were divided randomly into a calibration data-set (75%) and validation data-set (25%). The multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models were then employed to predict SOC contents by using two Landsat 8 OLI images acquired in dry (June 2019) and wet (February 2019) months. The accuracy of developed models was evaluated by applying the ME (mean error), R-2 (coefficient of determination), and RMSE (root mean square error) indices. The results indicated that the derived ANN model performed better than the developed MLR and SVM models for predicting SOC contents in both dry and wet months. Overall, the best result for SOC contents prediction was obtained by the ANN model in dry month (ME = -0.055, RMSE = 0.163 and R-2 = 0.743). It was concluded that using Landsat 8 OLI image in the dry month brings higher accuracy for SOC prediction.

TI  - South African traditional values and beliefs regarding informed consent and limitations of the principle of respect for autonomy in African communities: a cross-cultural qualitative study
T2  - BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Western-European concept of libertarian rights-based autonomy, which advocates respect for individual rights, may conflict with African cultural values and norms. African communitarian ethics focuses on the interests of the collective whole or community, rather than rugged individualism. Hence collective decision-making processes take precedence over individual autonomy or consent. This apparent conflict may impact informed consent practice during biomedical research in African communities and may hinder ethical principlism in African bioethics. This study explored African biomedical researchers' perspectives regarding informed consent and potential limitations to the principle of respect for autonomy in African communities. Methods We conducted a qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 12 biomedical researchers, five females and seven males aged 34 to 74 years, currently working at an African university. Interviews lasted 35-40 min each and involved semi-structured open-ended interviews, which allowed participants to offer information about their perceptions and feelings regarding respect for autonomy and informed consent as practised in Africa. Empirical data from the interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic content analysis, together with an interrogation of relevant scientific literature about African communitarian ethics, making evaluations and drawing inferences consistent with the empirical bioethics approach. Results Based on these interviews and analysis of relevant literature, we found that informed consent is difficult to apply in an African context because it derives from a Western conception of libertarian rights-based autonomy. Most respondents pointed out that it was challenging to implement informed consent in the African setting. Furthermore, communalism, customary beliefs, spirituality, and relational autonomy are predominant in most African communities, as exemplified by the African moral philosophies of Ubuntu/Botho and Ukama, which emphasize communitarianism over individual rights. We also found that language, education, poverty, and cultural beliefs are barriers to obtaining proper informed consent in African communities. Conclusions We conclude that there are limitations to applying the principle of respect for autonomy and informed consent in African communities, especially in the context of human biomedical research. We recommend using a more relational approach, such as Ross's prima facie duties, to implement informed consent in African communities.

TI  - Transformative pathways - Using integrated assessment models more effectively to open up plausible and desirable low-carbon futures
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated assessment models (IAM) and resulting scenarios have become increasingly institutionalised and relevant in the science-policy interface of climate policy. Despite their analytical strengths to conceive low-carbon futures, their co-evolution with the transnational science-policy interface of climate politics has also led to a focus on a specific set of techno-economic futures that are typically based on a relatively narrow set of assumptions. This deviates attention from alternatives that are hardly studied by IAMs, but might be more desirable from a societal perspective. We argue that research-based models and scenarios should support rather than narrow down deliberations on possible and desirable futures and provide an impetus to enact socially desirable change. Accordingly, we propose three future directions regarding the development and use of IAMs: 1) incorporate a plurality of perspectives on plausibility and desirability through iterative participatory engagement and worldview-based scenario exploration, 2) seek collaboration with the arts and humanities to expand the range of imagined futures beyond the status quo and 3) make projected futures more tangible and experiential so that diverse societal actor groups can understand and genuinely engage with them. By deploying the indisputable analytical strengths of IAMs optimally within these suggestions, we believe they can facilitate broader societal debates about transformative pathways to low-carbon futures.

TI  - Changes in turbidity and human activities along Haihe River Basin during lockdown of COVID-19 using satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the outbreak of the COVID-19, China implemented an urban lockdown in the first period. These measures not only effectively curbed the spread of the virus but also brought a positive impact on the ecological environment. The water quality of urban inland river has a significant impact on urban ecology and public health. This study uses Sentinel-2 visible and near-infrared band reflectance and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) to analyze the water quality of the Haihe River Basin during the control period of COVID-19. It is found that during the lockdown period, the river water quality was significantly improved compared to the same period in 2019. The average NDTI of the Haihe River Basin in March decreased by 0.27, a decrease of 219.06%; in April, it increased by 0.07, that is 38.38%. Further exploration using VIIRS lights found that the brightness of the lights in the main urban area was significantly lower in February, the beginning of the lockdown. However, as the city was unblocked, the lights rose sharply in March and then recovered to normal. There is obvious asynchrony in changes between river turbidity and light. The results can help understand the impact of human activities on the natural environment.

TI  - Snow features on sea ice in the western Arctic Ocean during summer 2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice and its snow cover are important components of the cryosphere and the climate system. A series of in situ snow measurements were conducted during the seventh Chinese Arctic expedition in summer 2016 in the western Arctic Ocean. In this study, we made an analysis of snow features on Arctic sea ice based on in situ observations and the satellite-derived parameter of snow grain size from MODIS spectral reflectance data. Results indicate that snow depth on Arctic sea ice varied between 19 and 241 mm, with a mean value of 100 mm. The mean density of the snow was 340.4 kg/m(3) during the expedition, which was higher than that reported in previous literature. The measurements revealed that a depth hoar layer was widely developed in the snow, accounting for 30%similar to 50% of the total snow depth. The equivalent snow grain size was small on the surface and large at the bottom in snow pits. The average relative error between MODIS-derived snow grain size and in situ measured surface snow grain size is 14.6%, indicating that remote sensing is a promising method to obtain large-scale information of snow grain size on Arctic sea ice.

TI  - Using Computed Tomography Lymphography for Mapping of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL IMAGING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: In breast cancer surgery, the combined use of the dye method and radioisotope (RI) method is recommended for identifying sentinel lymph nodes. However, the RI method is difficult to license, expensive, and difficult to introduce. Thus, we introduced computed tomography lymphography (CTLG) and investigated the characteristics and usefulness of CTLG.Material and Methods: Among breast cancer patients who underwent surgery during a 6-year period from January 2013 to December 2018, CTLG was performed on 141 patients with clinically negative lymph node metastasis. These cases were then retrospectively investigated. The number and location of lymph vessel, true sentinel lymph nodes, and the positional relationships with surrounding muscles and blood vessels were confirmed from the constructed 3D images. The actual surgeries were then performed using a dye method with indigo carmine based on images obtained using CTLG.Results: CTLG was able to identify lymph vessels and true sentinel lymph nodes in 131 of the 141 cases (92.91%). There were 97 patients in whom the first true sentinel lymph node reached from the breast was one node, 30 with two nodes, and 4 with three nodes. Moreover, there were three cases in which sentinel lymph nodes were present at Level II. During surgery, sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 131 patients (92.91%) using dye.Conclusion: CTLG has a high identification rate in sentinel lymph nodes, and it is considered a convenient and useful examination method because a lot of information, such as the number and position of sentinel lymph nodes, can be obtained.

TI  - Phase unmixing of TerraSAR-X staring spotlight interferograms in building scale for PS height and deformation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Staring spotlight images with a spatial resolution of up to tens of centimeters are good data sources for urban applications including displacement mapping. However, phase discontinuities, layover, and shadowing effect are also associated with staring spotlight interferograms, adding to the difficulties in height estimation and spatial phase unwrapping. The scattering mechanism of the staring spotlight images in the urban environment is complicated, thus it is difficult to simulate and remove the reference height of staring spotlight interferograms directly. In addition, global spatial phase unwrapping networks tend to smooth phase discontinuities. With the aim of implementing height estimation and phase unwrapping for TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight interferograms, a workflow for phase unmixing of TerraSAR-X staring spotlight interferograms is proposed in this paper. The PS height is estimated in the baseline domain rather than the spatial domain. Taking into account the length and height change of each connection, the spatial phase unwrapping network is adjusted and segmented into isolated networks. The connected components of the adjusted spatial phase unwrapping network can be identified using graph theory. Spatial phase unwrapping is implemented in individual networks. The unfolded height phase is separated from the unwrapped phase, and the remaining phase is deformation dominated. Compared with the traditional global spatial phase unwrapping method, this study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed least squares parameter search and graph partition based workflow in urban area, for phase unmixing of TerraSAR-X staring spotlight interferograms in building scale for PS height and deformation, as evidenced by external LiDAR DSM and temperature records.

TI  - Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Multiple Machine Learning Methods in Remote Sensing Quantitative Retrieval of Suspended Matter Concentrations: A Case Study of Nansi Lake in North China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is a core parameter in the quantitative retrieval of ocean color remote sensing and an important indicator for evaluating the quality of the aquatic environment. This study selects part of Nansi Lake in North China as the study area. Researchers used Hyperion remote sensing data and field-measured TSM concentration as data sources. Firstly, the characteristic variables with high correlation were selected based on spectral analysis. Then, seven methods such as linear regression, BP neural network (BP), KNN, random forest (RF), and random forest based on genetic algorithm optimization (GA_RF) are used to construct the inversion model of TSM concentration. The retrieval accuracy of each model shows that the machine learning models are much more accurate than the linear model. Among them, the GA_RF model retrieves the suspended solids concentration with the best performance and the highest prediction accuracy, with a determination coefficient R-2 of 0.98, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.715 mg/L, and an average relative error (ARE) of 6.83%. Additionally, the spatial distribution of TSM concentration was inversed by Hyperion remote sensing image. The results showed that the concentration of TSM was lower in the northwest and higher in the southeast, and the concentration distribution was uneven, showing the characteristics of a typical shallow macrophytic lake. This study provides an effective method for monitoring TSM concentration and other water quality parameters in the shallow macrophytic lake and further proves the advantages of machine learning in ocean color inversion. All in all, this research provides some useful methods and suggestions for quantitative inversion of TSM concentration in shallow macrophytic lakes.

TI  - Quantifying 28-year (1991-2019) shoreline change trends along the Mnazi Bay - Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park, Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, shoreline movements observed at the Mnazi Bay - Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (MBREMP) in Tanzania have been affecting habitats' conditions and also social and economic conditions of local communities. To date, however, there has been no systematic spatial and temporal analysis of shoreline change trends along the MBREMP coast.In this study, we conducted an analysis of multi-temporal earth observation satellite imagery for assessment of MBREMP shoreline change trends, over the period 1991-2019, using satellite images and geographic information system techniques. Satellite images retrieved from Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager) instruments were analyzed within a geographic information system environment. Shorelines were extracted from satellite imagery and shoreline change rates were measured along transects using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software.From the analysis performed over the period of 28 years, we concluded that shoreline changes in MBREMP were dominated by erosion with an average erosion rate of -1.5 m/year +/- 1.4 m/year. No-shoreline change (stable shoreline) was identified in 34.8% of transects analyzed, erosion in 63.9%, while accretion occurred in 1.3%. The extent of erosion and accretion varied, however, from one area to another. Accretion and lower erosion rates were measured in the northern part of MBREMP, while higher erosion rates were found in the southern part of the park, which serves as important feeding, breeding, and nesting habitats for endangered turtle species.These results do contribute to identify the most affected areas of MBREMP shoreline and to inform and guide further research related to the sustainable management of ecosystems and the maintenance of the natural systems/resources contained in the park.

TI  - Increases in both HIV and syphilis among men who have sex with men in Vietnam: Urgent need for comprehensive responses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the temporal trends and factors associated with HIV and syphilis infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in southern Vietnam. Data from the 2014-2018 national HIV sentinel surveillance of MSM aged 16 years or older were collected from three provinces, including An Giang (N = 761), Can Tho (N = 900), and Ho Chi Minh City (N = 1426), and examined for changes in prevalence rates of HIV and syphilis and risk behaviors over time. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the trends and correlates of HIV and syphilis infections among MSM. There were upward trends for HIV (9.5% in 2014 to 14.2% in 2018, p-trend<0.01), syphilis (4.9% in 2014 to 8.0% 2018, p-trend<0.01), and HIV/syphilis co-infection (1.9% in 2014 to 3.1% in 2018, p-trend=0.01). Factors associated with HIV infection included place of residence, early sexual debut, consistent condom use and not engaging in anal sex during the past month, not knowing one's HIV test results, having ever injected drugs, and having active syphilis. Additionally, early sexual debut and being HIV positive were associated with syphilis infection. Rising prevalences of these infections among MSM suggests an urgent need for comprehensive intervention packages for HIV/STI prevention.

TI  - Pre-harvest weed mapping of<i> Cirsium</i><i> arvense</i> L. based on free satellite imagery - The importance of weed aggregation and image resolution
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - New data platforms have made satellite data freely available and farmers can now produce variable rate application (VRA) maps for nitrogen fertilisers and other inputs based on satellite images. The data platforms are currently attracting attention for site-specific weed management because they are free and user-friendly. Satellite imagery is mainly relevant for detecting large, dense weed patches that have unique spectral characteristics in low-resolution images. The objective of this study was to examine whether Sentinel-2 images are useful in the detection of Cirsium arvense and other green vegetation in pre-harvest cereals. It was hypothesised that there is a lower limit for detection and that weeds in large patches are easier to detect than weeds in small patches. Fifteen fields infested with C. arvense were used to evaluate the possibilities of utilising the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 images as a weed classifier. High-resolution RGB images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used as ground-truthing after classifying green pixels as weeds with C. arvense as the main contributor. The study showed that C. arvense-dominated weed populations were much less aggregated than previously reported. On average, 90 % of the weeds occurred on 50 % of the field area, in a range from 21 % to 72 %. The potential herbicide savings using Sentinel-2 images were in the range of 6 % to 46 %, averaging 24 %. The low weed aggregation combined with low image resolution limited the prospects of using Sentinel-2 images for weed detection. The study showed that UAV imagery offers much greater potential for herbicide savings due to higher image resolution, allowing the detection of individual C. arvense shoots.

TI  - Spatio-temporal-spectral-angular observation model that integrates observations from UAV and mobile mapping vehicle for better urban mapping
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a complex urban scene, observation from a single sensor unavoidably leads to voids in observations, failing to describe urban objects in a comprehensive manner. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal-spectral-angular observation model to integrate observations from UAV and mobile mapping vehicle platform, realizing a joint, coordinated observation operation from both air and ground. We develop a multi-source remote sensing data acquisition system to effectively acquire multi-angle data of complex urban scenes. Multi-source data fusion solves the missing data problem caused by occlusion and achieves accurate, rapid, and complete collection of holographic spatial and temporal information in complex urban scenes. We carried out an experiment on Baisha Town, Chongqing, China and obtained multi-sensor, multi-angle data from UAV and mobile mapping vehicle. We first extracted the point cloud from UAV and then integrated the UAV and mobile mapping vehicle point cloud. The integrated results combined both the characteristics of UAV and mobile mapping vehicle point cloud, confirming the practicability of the proposed joint data acquisition platform and the effectiveness of spatio-temporal-spectral-angular observation model. Compared with the observation from UAV or mobile mapping vehicle alone, the integrated system provides an effective data acquisition solution toward comprehensive urban monitoring.

TI  - Satellite-derived quantification of the diurnal and annual dynamics of land surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal and annual cycles of Earth drive the land surface temperature (LST) variations in space and time but their combined effects are conveyed differently from place to place as a function of climate, local weather conditions, and surface characteristics. Fitting a model of the diurnal or annual LST cycle (DTC and ATC, respectively) to satellite data yields several parameters that summarize the thermal dynamics of each pixel. These parameters are distinct for each place and reveal how the ATC and DTC differ between pixels. Currently, due to the lack of LST with high spatial and temporal resolution, it is impossible to characterize both cycles at kilometer or sub-kilometer scale. This work addresses this problem and presents a method for simultaneously quantifying the annual and diurnal LST dynamics at kilometer scale. The proposed method is based on Annual Cycle Parameters (ACP) retrieved from geostationary satellite data for every 30 min between 00:00 and 23:30 local time and uses statistical downscaling to enhance their coarse spatial resolution. We apply our method to continental Europe for the period 2009-2013 and validate it using independent ACP retrieved from satellite and in-situ LST. Our results reveal how the climate and surface conditions influence the shape of the ACP diurnal profiles over Europe and illustrate for the first time the excellent agreement between satellite-derived ACP and ACP derived from in-situ LST. Even though our method is limited by the spatial coverage of the geostationary data, it provides a novel way for describing Earth's thermal response to solar heating.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of spring phenology detection by optimally smoothing satellite vegetation index time series based on local cloud frequency
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology can be extracted from vegetation index (VI) time series of satellite data. The maximum value composite (MVC) procedure and smoothing filters have been conventionally used as standard methods to exclude noises in the VI time series before extracting the vegetation phenology [e.g., National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) VNP22Q2 and United States Geological Survey (USGS) MCD12Q2 phenology products]. However, it is unclear how to optimize the MVC and smoothing filters to produce the most accurate phenology metrics given that cloud frequency varies spatially. This study designed two simulation experiments, namely (1) using only the MVC and (2) using the MVC and smoothing filters together to smooth the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series for detecting spring phenology, i.e., start of season (SOS), over the northern hemisphere (north of 30 degrees N) on a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid cell basis by the inflection point and relative threshold algorithms. The results revealed that (1) the inappropriate selection of MVC periods (e.g., too short or too long) affected the accuracy of the SOS extracted by both phenology detection algorithms; (2) a filtering process with optimal parameters can reduce the effects of the MVC period on SOS extraction to a considerable extent, i.e., 65% and 61% for iterative Savitzky-Golay (SG) and penalized cubic splines (SP) filters, respectively; (3) optimal parameters for both the MVC and smoothing filters showed significant spatial heterogeneity; and (4) validation with ground PhenoCam data indicated that optimal parameters of the MVC and smoothing filters can produce more accurate results than official vegetation phenology products that use uniform parameters. Specifically, the R-2 values of the NASA product and the USGS product were 0.58 and 0.67, which were increased to 0.70 and 0.81, respectively, by the optimal smoothing process. Optimal parameters of the MVC and smoothing filters provided by this study in each 5 degrees x 5 degrees sub-region may help future studies to improve the accuracy of phenology detection from satellite VI time series.

TI  - The role of aerodynamic resistance in thermal remote sensing-based evapotranspiration models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerodynamic resistance (hereafter r(a)) is a preeminent variable in evapotranspiration (ET) modelling. The accurate quantification of r(a) plays a pivotal role in determining the performance and consistency of thermal remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models for estimating ET at local to regional scales. Atmospheric stability links r(a) with land surface temperature (LST) and the representation of their interactions in the SEB models determines the accuracy of ET estimates.The present study investigates the influence of r(a) and its relation to LST uncertainties on the performance of three structurally different SEB models. It used data from nine Australian OzFlux eddy covariance sites of contrasting aridity in conjunction with MODIS Terra and Aqua LST and leaf area index (LAI) products. Simulations of the sensible heat flux (H) and the latent heat flux (LE, the energy equivalent of ET in W/m(2)) from the SPARSE (Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration), SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) and STIC (Surface Temperature Initiated Closure) models forced with MODIS LST, LAI, and in-situ meteorological datasets were evaluated against flux observations in water-limited (arid and semi-arid) and energy-limited (mesic) ecosystems from 2011 to 2019.Our results revealed an overestimation tendency of instantaneous LE by all three models in the water-limited shrubland, woodland and grassland ecosystems by up to 50% on average, which was caused by an underestimation of H. Overestimation of LE was associated with discrepancies in r(a) retrievals under conditions of high atmospheric instability, during which uncertainties in LST (expressed as the difference between MODIS LST and in-situ LST) apparently played a minor role. On the other hand, a positive difference in LST coincided with low r(a) (high wind speeds) and caused a slight underestimation of LE at the water-limited sites. The impact of r(a) on the LE residual error was found to be of the same magnitude as the influence of LST uncertainties in the semi-arid ecosystems as indicated by variable importance in projection (VIP) coefficients from partial least squares regression above unity. In contrast, our results for the mesic forest ecosystems indicated minor dependency on r(a) for modelling LE (VIP < 0.4), which was due to a higher roughness length and lower LST resulting in the dominance of mechanically generated turbulence, thereby diminishing the importance of buoyancy production for the determination of r(a).

TI  - Mapping the Spatiotemporal Changes of Land Use/Land Cover on the Urban Heat Island Effect by Open Source Data: A Case Study of Lucknow, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) have been relevant factors in causing the changes in Urban Heat Intensity (UHI) pattern across rural and urban areas of cities all over the world. Studies conducted have shown that this relation does not depend on extent meaning UHI that can be an important factor not only for a country but for environment of a city also. Over the years, it is reflected in local environment of cities. In this study, such relations are shown over Lucknow city of India for 4 decades from 1985 to 2015 using freely available 100 m resolution Decadal Land use map for India for year 1985, 1995 & 2005 and CGLS-100 product for year 2015. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is calculated from Landsat series data using NDVI-based emissivity method. LST is correlated with 5 LU classes Built-up, Agricultural, Vegetation, Water & Barren. LC indices Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) & Normalised Difference Barren Index (NDBaI) are correlated with Normalised LST (NLST), respectively, and it is found that NLST is positively related with all indices except for NDVI with strong negative correlation and R-2 of 0.27. Results show reduction of 22 km(2) in area affected from UHI for Lucknow from 1985 to 2015 and expansion of UHI region for Lucknow towards its outer boundary. The study helps in understanding the locality of UHI effect in a city of a developing country with the help of open source data.

TI  - Importance of the legacy effect for assessing spatiotemporal correspondence between interannual tree-ring width and remote sensing products in the Sierra Nevada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon uptake and tree growth are important factors for assessing productivity and long-term carbon storage. Measurements of radial stem growth are mainly performed at the individual tree scale and can be used to infer ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP). However, these measurements are spatially limited, and remote sensing provides a promising tool to track vegetation function and productivity across spatial scales, making it a viable technique for assessing variation in interannual tree growth and carbon storage. In this study we examined the correspondence between in-situ annual tree-ring width across four dominant evergreen species in the Sierra Nevada and a wide range of remotely sensed products linked to carbon uptake including NPP, gross primary productivity (GPP), net photosynthesis (PSN), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), near infrared reflectance of vegetation index (NIRV), and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) from MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) as well as downscaled solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) products, using a 14 year dataset (2000-2014) across 62 forest sites. We show that variation of annual tree-ring width was best captured by the annual sum of MODIS GPP, with a legacy effect (5-month backwards shift). Across all forest sites, MODIS GPP with a 5-month legacy effect showed moderate correspondence with tree-ring width (r = 0.60). Within each individual site, however, the interannual correspondence between MODIS GPP with a legacy effect and tree growth was stronger (median r = 0.70 vs 0.14 without a legacy effect). The importance of legacy effects in explaining tree growth variation within sites indicates that tree growth each year is influenced by carbon uptake during the latter part of the previous growing season. Additional local environmental factors also explained annual variation in tree-ring width, including (in descending order of importance) local tree density, latitude, slope, DBH, elevation and aspect.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Endometrial Cancer after Supracervical Hysterectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Occult endometrial cancer after supracervical hysterectomy is uncommon. Even if optimal management of those rare cases is still unproven, to guide the need for adjuvant treatment, restaging should be recommended in this situation. Methods The study was approved by institutional review board (DIPUSVSP-27-07-20107). We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with occult grade 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (pT1a) with negative surgical margin and smooth uterine muscle of uncertain malignant potential after supracervical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed for pelvic pain and uterine fibroids in a local hospital. Preoperative CT scan of chest-abdomen-pelvis did not show any lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Pelvic US scan revealed a normal cervical stump and a hypoechoic 18-mm right parametrial nodule. We describe the feasibility of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node identification with cervical stump injection of indocyanine green. Results The patient underwent laparoscopic radical trachelectomy, left pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsy, right pelvic lymphadenectomy, peritoneal washing. Patient did not report any intraoperative or postoperative complication. At final histology cervix, SLN (ultrastaging) and pelvic lymph nodes were negative, while parametrial nodule was reported as metastasis from endometrial adenocarcinoma. Surgical margins were clear. Patient was staged as FIGO IIIB and underwent adjuvant chemo-radiation. She is now alive and disease-free, 12 months after the surgery. Conclusions This video (Video 1) underlines the fact that SLN mapping with cervical injection is a feasible and safe technique also without the uterine corpus after supracervical hysterectomy. The unilateral mapping could be due to the presence of metastatic parametrium on the right side.

TI  - Technical and Social Approaches to Study Shoreline Change of Kuakata, Bangladesh
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, shoreline determination has become an issue of increasing importance and concern, especially at the local level, as sea level continues to rise. This study identifies the rates of absolute and net erosion, accretion, and shoreline stabilization along the coast of Kuakata, a vulnerable coastal region in south-central Bangladesh. Shoreline change was detected by applying remote sensing and geographic information system (RS-GIS)-based techniques by using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) satellite images at 30-m resolution from 1989, 2003, 2010, and 2020. The band combination (BC) method was used to extract the shoreline (i.e., land-water boundary) due to its improved accuracy over other methods for matching with the existing shoreline position. This study also used participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools which revealed the societal impacts caused by the shoreline changes. Coupling RS-GIS and PRA techniques provides an enhanced understanding of shoreline change and its impacts because PRA enriches the RS-GIS outcomes by contextualizing the findings. Results show that from 1989 to 2020, a total of 13.59 km(2) of coastal land was eroded, and 3.27 km(2) of land was accreted, suggesting that land is retreating at about 0.32 km(2) yr(-1). Results from the PRA tools support this finding and demonstrate that fisheries and tourism are affected by the shoreline change. These results are important in Kuakata, a major tourist spot in Bangladesh, because of the impacts on fisheries, recreation, resource extraction, land use planning, and coastal risk management.

TI  - A comparison of low-level wind profiles from Mode-S EHS data with ground-based remote sensing data
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Romanian Air Traffic Services Administration is currently testing the operational production of vertical wind profiles calculated from aircraft-reported Mode-Select enhanced surveillance (EHS) data provided by secondary surveillance radars. This paper presents an estimation and a verification of the biases of the calculated wind components using a reference represented by sodar and lidar measured wind. The biases are caused by errors in the magnetic declination, neglecting the pitch angle of aircraft in the initial climb, and by errors of sodar or lidar orientation. The estimated bias of the meridional components confirms the flight direction dependence of the error of wind components transversal to the flight track found in previous studies, while the strong correlation of wind and flight direction in aerodrome traffic makes this bias to cause a bias of the wind direction more evident at low wind speeds (similar or equal to 10 degrees). The estimated zonal component bias is negligible with descending aircraft, but positive, depending on the pitch angle, up to approximately 50% of the component, with ascending aircraft. The verification of the accuracy of these estimates is performed by comparing the ground-based remote-sensed wind data with the Mode-S EHS derived wind data in the lower boundary layer of Bucharest Henri Coanda airport area. Results show a generally good agreement with the predictions of the measurement error model, with residual errors being assigned to intrinsic instrument measurement errors and assumptions on the average aircraft speed.

TI  - Disentangling the relationships between conservative economic and social attitudes and support for environmental action
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have debated why people on the right of politics are consistently found to be less likely to support environmental action than those on the left. Some authors argue that this relationship is primarily driven by conservative economic attitudes, while several studies have demonstrated a negative link between conservative social attitudes and environmental attitudes. However, as few studies include both conservative economic and social attitudes, it remains unclear whether both sets of attitudes relate to environmental attitudes independently, or whether one confounds the other. This study uses Bayesian regression analyses of data from the 2017 New Zealand election study, finding that both conservative economic attitudes (free market support, opposition to welfare) and conservative social attitudes (exclusionary attitudes, right-wing authoritarianism) have independent negative relationships with environmental attitudes. These results imply that the link between conservative ideology and environmental attitudes is as much about social attitudes and worldview as about economics.

TI  - Invertebrate and vertebrate predation rates in a hyperarid ecosystem following an oil spill
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme temperatures and scarce precipitation in deserts have led to abiotic factors often being regarded as more important than biotic ones in shaping desert communities. The presumed low biological activity of deserts is also one reason why deserts are often overlooked by conservation programs. We provide the first quantification of predation intensity from a desert ecosystem using artificial sentinel prey emulating caterpillars, a standardized monitoring tool to quantify relative predation pressure by many invertebrate and vertebrate predators. The study was conducted in a protected natural area affected by oil spills in 1975 and 2014; hence, we assessed the potential effects of oil pollution on predation rates. We found that predation was mostly due to invertebrate rather than vertebrate predators, fluctuated throughout the year, was higher at the ground level than in the tree canopy, and was not negatively affected by the oil spills. The mean predation rate per day (12.9%) was within the range found in other ecosystems, suggesting that biotic interactions in deserts ought not to be neglected and that ecologists should adopt standardized tools to track ecological functions and allow for comparisons among ecosystems.

AB  - It is vital to monitor the post-seismic landslides economically and effectively in high-mountain regions for the long term. The landslide creep could cause a subtle change of the overlying vegetation after the earthquake, which will lead to the change of vegetation spectral characteristics in optical remote sensing data. The optical remote sensing technique can be used to monitor the landslide creep areas with dense vegetation in a large range at a low cost because it is easy to obtain multi-temporal, multiple-scale, and multi-spectral information. We identified and extracted the vegetation change area before the 2018 Baige landslide by the high-resolution optical remote sensing data. Firstly, the image fusion method was used to improve the accuracy of change detection. Then, vegetation coverage before the landslide was calculated. The vegetation change was identified, and qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyze the spatio-temporal changes of vegetation coverage. Our results indicate that the creep distance of the landslide is about 50 m and the vegetation in the back scarp area and the main sliding area display a significant downward trend with time closing to the landslide comparing with that in the reference area. The vegetation change in the remote sensing image has an excellent spatio-temporal correlation with the landslide creep. This study provides a possible way and perspective for monitoring post-seismic landslide disasters.

TI  - Synergic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for automatic detection of earthquake-triggered landscape changes: A case study of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake (Mw 7.8), New Zealand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes can trigger numerous landslides and cause other significant changes in the landscape over large areas. This study presents a new processing scheme combining radar (Copernicus Sentinel-1) and optical satellite data (Copernicus Sentinel-2) to quickly and easily map landscape changes such as landslides, coastal uplift and changes in water bodies caused by a severe event such as an earthquake. The processing scheme has been tested for the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake (Mw 7.8), New Zealand, which impacted vast and mostly inaccessible areas, causing hundreds of landslides. The workflow combines the following change-detection methods: i) Sentinel-1 amplitude change detection ii) Sentinel-2-based detection of non-vegetated areas that occurred after the event using the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI). To get a more complex view of the surface changes caused by the Kaikoura earthquake, the available online services and tools were further tested (open source via the European Space Agency) allowing automatic detection of vertical displacements and deformations. It was concluded, that the above-mentioned approaches facilitated the assessment of earthquake-triggered changes in a comprehensive manner. The methodology is an example of how to detect earthquake landscape changes in an automatic and rapid manner. The new processing scheme for the synergic use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data has high potential to be used for operational and scientific purposes, since it relies on globally available, free data and provides high spatial and temporal resolution. The results can be obtained and made available only a few days after an event, therefore providing significant insights into earthquake impact assessment and may also be helpful for prioritizing field work.

TI  - Characterization of water use and water balance for the croplands of Kansas using satellite, climate, and irrigation data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states in the United States, where agricultural irrigation is a primary user of underground and surface water. Because of low precipitation and declining groundwater levels in western and central Kansas, sustainable management of irrigation water resources is a critical issue in the agricultural productivity of the state. The objective of this study is to analyze and characterize the water use and water balance in the croplands of Kansas using satellite observations, meteorological data, and in situ irrigation water use records. We used actual evapotranspiration (ETa), precipitation, soil moisture, and irrigation water use to calculate water balance for Kansas in 2015 at scales of counties, climatic divisions, and groundwater management districts (GMD). The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model was implemented to estimate 30-m resolution ETa. Results showed that the seasonal (May - September) precipitation, soil water storage change, and ETa are 528 mm, 80 mm, and 555 mm, respectively, on average of all croplands in the state. The annual net irrigation water consumption was 293 mm for irrigated croplands, indicating that irrigation water constitutes an substantial portion of the water supply in the state. The total volumetric irrigation water use was 3.24 km3 for all croplands within five GMDs in western and south-central Kansas, while only 0.38 km3 was outside of GMDs. The multiple regression models of ETa against precipitation and irrigation water use were statistically significant with R2 values of 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, at county and climate division scales. Regression models also indicated a higher rate of ETa response to irrigation water use than that to precipitation. Our study demonstrated the spatial patterns of crop water use and water balance in Kansas, which could provide useful information for management of irrigation agriculture and water resources for the state.

TI  - Evaluating the state-of-the-art in remote volcanic eruption characterization Part I: Raikoke volcano, Kuril Islands
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Raikoke, a small, unmonitored volcano in the Kuril Islands, erupted in June 2019. We integrate data from satellites (including Sentinel-2, TROPOMI, MODIS, Himawari-8), the International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound network, and global lightning detection network (GLD360) with information from local authorities and social media to retrospectively characterize the eruptive sequence and improve understanding of the pre-, syn- and post-eruptive behavior. We observe six infrasound pulses beginning on 21 June at 17:49:55 UTC as well as the main Plinian phase on 21 June at 22:29 UTC. Each pulse is tracked in space and time using lightning and satellite imagery as the plumes drift eastward. Post-eruption visible satellite imagery shows expansion of the island's surface area, an increase in crater size, and a possibly-linked algal bloom south of the island. We use thermal satellite imagery and plume modeling to estimate plume height at 10(-12) km asl and 1.5-2 x 10(6) kg/s mass eruption rate. Remote infrasound data provide insight into syn-eruptive changes in eruption intensity. Our analysis illustrates the value of interdisciplinary analyses of remote data to illuminate eruptive processes. However, our inability to identify deformation, pre-eruptive outgassing, and thermal signals, which may reflect the relatively short duration (similar to 12 h) of the eruption and minimal land area around the volcano and/or the character of closed-system eruptions, highlights current limitations in the application of remote sensing for eruption detection and characterization.

TI  - Ground displacements revealed by A-DInSAR analysis in the Germano iron mining complex before and after the Fundao Dam collapse using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced differential SAR interferometry (A-DInSAR) has been used as an effective monitoring tool in mining environments. This work presents an investigation of surface displacement in the Germano iron mining complex (Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil), where on November 5, 2015, the Fundao tailings dam collapsed. Initially, the analysis was performed with 14 Sentinel-1 images, acquired from May 8, 2015, to November 4, 2015, and focused on the Fundao dam before its rupture to detect prior signs of surface deformations. The analysis after the Fundao dam collapse was conducted in the Germano area using 43 Sentinel-1 images, acquired from November 16, 2015 to May 15, 2017, and aimed at detecting surface displacement on the remaining infrastructure, the Sela&Tulipa and Selinha dikes and the main Germano tailings dam, which were directly or indirectly affected by the accident. The results reveal precursor signals of surface displacement at the Fundao dam prior to rupture, particularly on the left abutment setback sector where the collapse started according to a witness, reaching accumulated values of up to -60 mm. The results provided by the A-DInSAR analysis after the dam collapse indicate a stability in the Sela&Tulipa and Selinha dikes as well as in the main Germano dam, which is corroborated by in situ topographic measurements. On the auxiliary dikes within the Germano reservoir, accumulated displacement of up to -90 mm caused by settlements and continuous traffic of vehicles was detected. In addition, the detected accumulate displacement within the reservoir showed values of up to -120 mm, in general caused by settlements of the waste dry material due to the inactivity of the mining process. The investigation emphasized the important role that satellite-based A-DInSAR can play in mitigating possible accidents and for operational planning and risk assessment in mining operations.

TI  - Optical model for the Baltic Sea with an explicit CDOM state variable: a case study with Model ERGOM (version 1.2)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in marine environments impacts primary production due to its absorption effect on the photosynthetically active radiation. In coastal seas, CDOM originates from terrestrial sources predominantly and causes spatial and temporal changing patterns of light absorption which should be considered in marine biogeochemical models. We propose a model approach in which Earth Observation (EO) products are used to define boundary conditions of CDOM concentrations in an ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea. CDOM concentrations in riverine water derived from EO products serve as forcing for the ecosystem model. For this reason, we introduced an explicit CDOM state variable in the model.We show that the light absorption by CDOM in the model can be improved considerably in comparison to approaches where CDOM is estimated from salinity. The model performance increases especially with respect to spatial CDOM patterns due to the consideration of single river properties. A prerequisite is high-quality CDOM data with sufficiently high spatial resolution which can be provided by the new generation of ESA satellite sensor systems (Sentinel 2 MSI and Sentinel 3 OLCI). Such data are essential, especially when local differences in riverine CDOM concentrations exist.

TI  - BERM: a Belowground Ecosystem Resiliency Model for estimating <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> belowground biomass
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns of Spartina alterniflora belowground biomass (BGB) are important for evaluating salt marsh resiliency. To solve this, we created the BERM (Belowground Ecosystem Resiliency Model), which estimates monthly BGB (30-m spatial resolution) from freely available data such as Landsat-8 and Daymet climate summaries. Our modeling framework relied on extreme gradient boosting, and used field observations from four Georgia salt marshes as ground-truth data. Model predictors included estimated tidal inundation, elevation, leaf area index, foliar nitrogen, chlorophyll, surface temperature, phenology, and climate data. The final model included 33 variables, and the most important variables were elevation, vapor pressure from the previous four months, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the previous five months, and inundation. Root mean squared error for BGB from testing data was 313 g m(-2) (11% of the field data range), explained variance (R-2) was 0.62-0.77. Testing data results were unbiased across BGB values and were positively correlated with ground-truth data across all sites and years (r = 0.56-0.82 and 0.45-0.95, respectively). BERM can estimate BGB within Spartina alterniflora salt marshes where environmental parameters are within the training data range, and can be readily extended through a reproducible workflow. This provides a powerful approach for evaluating spatiotemporal BGB and associated ecosystem function.

TI  - Discriminating commercial forest species using image texture computed from a WorldView-2 pan-sharpened image and partial least squares discriminant analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Discriminating forest species is crucial for effective management of commercial forest plantations. Whereas several variants of vegetation indices have commonly been used to delineate forest species, their efficacy is impeded by saturation at high biomass levels. However, image texture does not suffer from saturation at high biomass levels, hence offers a unique opportunity to reliably map commercial forest species typically characterized by dense canopies. In this study, we integrated image texture computed from a 0.5 m WorldView-2 pan-sharpened image with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to detect and map commercial forest species. The results illustrated that the image texture (overall accuracy (OA) = 77%, kappa = 0.69) outcompeted both the vegetation indices (OA = 69%, kappa = 0.59) and raw spectral bands models (OA = 64%, kappa = 0.52). PLS-DA together with variable importance in the projection selected homogeneity, correlation and mean as the most significant texture parameters, which were predominantly computed from the red-edge, near infrared (NIR) 1 and 2 bands. Furthermore, PLS-DA model commonly selected the 7 x 7 than the 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 moving windows. Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of image texture in discriminating commercial forest species.

TI  - Variability of phytoplankton biomass and environmental drivers in a semi-enclosed coastal ecosystem (San Matias Gulf, Patagonian Continental Shelf, Argentina) using ocean color remote sensing (MODIS) and oceanographic field data: Implications for fishery resources
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual cycles of phytoplankton biomass (using chlorophyll-a as a proxy) and seasonal patterns of environmental drivers were analyzed in a semi-enclosed coastal ecosystem (San Matfas Gulf, SMG, Patagonian Continental Shelf, Argentina). Monthly climatologies (2003-2014) of satellite images of chlorophyll-a (Chla-sat), sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and euphotic depth (Z(1%)) were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Satellite environmental variables were evaluated together with oceanographic field data (temperature, nitrate, and chlorophyll-a). Thus, this study analyzes the Chla-sat data to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of the phytoplankton biomass in the SMG and investigates its relationship with the regional environmental drivers. Two contrasting phytoplankton annual cycles characteristic of these temperate waters were distinguished. PCA discriminated the inner and outer areas separated by a complex frontal system. The gulfs inner waters showed a bimodal phytoplankton cycle (maximums in autumn and spring) associated with the seasonal stratification of the water column in deeper areas and the consequent nitrate limitation in summer. The outer waters adjacent to the continental shelf showed unimodal cycles (maximum in autumn or spring) linked to the vertical mixing of the water column in shallow areas with moderate light intensity and nitrate availability. For both annual phytoplankton cycles, light is the main limiting factor in winter. Finally, the analyzed environmental patterns suggest that a tidal front favor feeding and spawning fishery resources in the north of the gulf.

TI  - In-orbit geometric calibration approach and positioning accuracy analysis for the Gaofen-7 laser footprint camera
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite is China's first submeter high-resolution optical stereo-mapping satellite. The satellite is equipped with two area-array laser footprint cameras to capture the laser spots emitted by laser altimeters. To accurately identify and locate the geographical positions of laser spots, a stepwise geometric calibration method with ground laboratory information for high-resolution area-array camera is proposed in this paper. It includes the internal and external calibration. First, the initial values of the camera's internal parameters are determined based on the laboratory calibration results. Then, based on a high-precision reference ortho-image and a digital elevation model, the ground control points (GCPs) for multi-scene footprint images are obtained by image matching. Finally, the external and internal calibration methods for the laser footprint camera are implemented successively. The experimental results indicate that this method can restore geometric imaging relationships with high precision. After the internal and external calibration, the systematic residual error of the image point is eliminated, the remaining residual achieves 0.38 pixel, and the accuracy of direct positioning on the ground is better than 5.0 m, and the elevation accuracy is within 1.5 m.

TI  - 100 years of lake evolution over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Lakes can be effective indicators of climate change, and this is especially so for the lakes over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), the highest plateau in the world, which undergoes little direct human influence. The QTP has warmed at twice the mean global rate, and the lakes there respond rapidly to climate and cryosphere changes. The QTP has similar to 1200 lakes larger than 1 km(2) with a total area of similar to 46 000 km(2), accounting for approximately half the number and area of lakes in China. The lakes over the QTP have been selected as an essential example for global lakes or water body studies. However, concerning lake data over the QTP are limited to the Landsat era and/or available at sparse intervals. Here, we extend the record to provide comprehensive lake evolution data sets covering the past 100 years (from 1920 to 2020). Lake mapping in 1920 was derived from an early map of the Republic of China and in 1960 from the topographic map of China. The densest lake inventories produced so far between 1970 and 2020 (covering all lakes larger than 1 km(2) in 14 epochs) are mapped from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI images. The lake evolution shows remarkable transitions between four phases: significant shrinkage in 1920-1995, rapid linear increase in 1995-2010, relative stability in 2010-2015, and further increase in 2015-2020. The spatial pattern indicates that the majority of lakes shrank in 1920-1995 and expanded in 1995-2020, with a dominant enlargement for central-north lakes in contrast to contraction for southern lakes in 1976-2020. The time series of precipitation between 1920 and 2017 indirectly supports the evolution trends of lakes identified in this study.

TI  - Biodiversity decline with increasing crop productivity in agricultural fields revealed by satellite remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing land-use intensity is a main driver of biodiversity loss in farmland, but measuring proxies for land-use intensity across entire landscapes is challenging. Here, we develop a novel method for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes using remote sensing parameters derived from the Sentinel-2 satellites. We link crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from time-series of a two-band enhanced vegetation index with biodiversity indicators (insect pollinators and insect-pollinated vascular plants) in agricultural fields in southern Sweden, with contrasting land management (i.e. conventional and organic farming). Our results show that arable land-use intensity in cereal systems dominated by spring-sown cereals can be approximated using Sentinel-2 productivity parameters. This was shown by the significant positive correlations between the amplitude and maximum value of the enhanced vegetation index on one side and farmer reported yields on the other. We also found that conventional cereal fields had 17% higher maximum and 13% higher amplitude of their enhanced vegetation index than organic fields. Sentinel-2 derived parameters were more strongly correlated with the abundance and species richness of bumblebees and the richness of vascular plants than the abundance and species richness of butterflies. The relationships we found between biodiversity and crop production proxies are consistent with predictions that increasing agricultural land-use intensity decreases field biodiversity. The newly developed method based on crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from Sentinel-2 data serves as a proof of concept for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity over cereal fields across larger areas. It enables the estimation of arable productivity in cereal systems, which can then be used by ecologists and develop tools for land managers as a proxy for land-use intensity. Coupled with spatially explicit databases on agricultural land-use, this method will enable crop-specific cereal productivity estimation across large geographical regions.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Coastal Zone Management to Control Development and Ensure Sustainability in a Rapidly Increasing Coastal Urban Environment: The Sultanate of Oman
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reckless construction and overextraction of resources have placed tremendous stress on the Sultanate of Oman's coastal ecosystems at Al-Batinah. The rate of sea level rise (SLR) intensifies under the multiple effects of environmental and social pressure. A projected 2 m SLR, for example, would inundate 200 km(2) of land and impact the Sultanate's entire socioeconomic growth cycle and coastal ecology. The coastal land-use impacts, calculated through Landsat satellite images and census data, are used to explain the effect of SLR on coastal land uses and ecosystems. The Sultanate of Oman's comprehensive coastal zone management (CZM) planning and practices have limitations when seeking to reduce the burden on coastal system-linked socioeconomic growth and environmental issues. The study documented in this article addresses the challenges of the Sultanate's CZM practices and proposes an integrated coastal zone sustainability management framework.

TI  - Integration of geophysical techniques to detect geotechnical hazards: a case study in Mokattam, Cairo, Egypt
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geotechnical hazards are the main factors that control decisions about construction in structurally complex zones. In the Mokattam area, Cairo, Egypt, different techniques, such as geotechnical techniques, remote sensing, and geophysical tools, are used and integrated to study the subsurface lithology, caves and structures to evaluate the possible geotechnical problems in these zones for expected future development in this area. Remote sensing applications indicate that the main trends of surface lineaments are E-W to NW-SE, whereas the minor trends are N-S to NE-SW. Ten vertical electrical sounding stations (VESs) were acquired and interpreted to delineate the subsurface stratigraphy. The interpretation results of these data show that the subsurface stratigraphy consists of 6 geoelectric units arranged from the surface to the bottom: fractured limestone, clay, marly limestone, dolomitic limestone, marl and marly limestone, and limestone. Nine electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles, twelve shallow seismic refraction (SSR) profiles, and ten ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles were acquired to study the shallow subsurface stratigraphy. The integration results of ERT and SSR measurements indicate that the shallow subsurface stratigraphy is composed of different rock units. The first layer is fractured limestone, which represents the surface layer of the upper plateau and contains caves in some areas. Then, layers of clay and marl, which are important geotechnical hazard sources, are present. Finally, a layer of limestone appears in the bottoms of some sections, and this limestone layer also contains caves. The GPR profiles have the highest resolution and can discriminate the top horizon into three to four detailed stratigraphic units, each of which has different amplitude values and caves and fractures in some profiles.

TI  - The need to understand the stability of arctic vegetation during rapid climate change: An assessment of imbalance in the literature
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Review
AB  - In early studies, northern vegetation response to global warming recognised both increases in biomass/cover and shrinking of species' distributional ranges. Subsequent field measurements focussed on vegetation cover and biomass increases ("greening"), and more recently decreases ("browning"). However, satellite observations show that more than 50% of arctic vegetation has not changed significantly despite rapid warming. While absence of change in remote sensing data does not necessarily mean no ecological change on the ground, the significant proportion of the Arctic that appears to be stable in the face of considerable climate change points to a greater need to understand Arctic ecosystem stability. In this paper, we performed an extensive review of the available literature to seek balances or imbalances between research focussing on "greening", "browning" and "stability/no change". We find that greening studies dominate the literature though two relatively small areas of the Arctic are disproportionately represented for this main change process. Critically, there are too few studies anywhere investigating stability. We highlight the need to understand the mechanisms driving Arctic ecosystem stability, and the potential longer-term consequences of remaining stable in a rapidly changing climate.

TI  - Imminent calving accelerated by increased instability of the Brunt Ice Shelf, in response to climate warming
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice shelves in the Southern Weddell Sea have large areas and volumes, and have previously been stable due to their setting in a region of cold near-surface and sub-surface ocean water. The Brunt Ice Shelf (BIS), one of the ice shelves closest to the continental shelf break in the region, just released an iceberg with an area of similar to 1,270 km(2) in late February 2021 and another large calving event is imminent. However, recent changes in the BIS, since 2017, have not been studied to date. In this study, we used multi-source remote sensing data (including satellite images, ice flow velocity products, digital elevation models, and altimetry data) to conclude that the instability of the ice shelf has been increasing. The increased instability is manifested by rapidly increasing ice flow velocity and the propagation rate of full-thickness rifts. The velocity at the front of the BIS accelerated by more than doubled from 2013-2021, and the width of Chasm 1 increased by almost three-fold from 2012-2021. Based on the expansion of Chasm 1 and the strain rate changes, an iceberg with an area of similar to 1,675 km(2) is predicted to be released from the BIS during October 2022. We used meteorological data, ocean synthesis, and field observations to attribute the increased instability of the BIS to warm inflow onto the continental shelf, which emphasizes the importance of further observation and analysis. Additionally, owing to its special location, the BIS could be an indicator of the evolution of other ice shelves in the Southern Weddell Sea. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Driving factors of urban sprawl in the Romanian plain. Regional and temporal modelling using logistic regression
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates built-up areas expansion after the 1990 in one of the highly urbanized regions of Romania - Romanian Plain, in order to explore the urban sprawl phenomena and its temporal and regional disparities in relation to some of the main distance driving factors. The research uses Landsat 4/5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery to derive built-up areas and quantify their expansion over time in relation to fourteen distance explanatory factors: i.e. previous built-up areas, main road infrastructure, Bucharest city's boundary, location of the urban centres classified according to demographic size and main economic function, forest land and water bodies. To estimate the influence of the predictors, the binary logistic regression was applied. Furthermore, to estimate the effectiveness of the predictor set in the variation of built-up areas expansion, the pseudo R-2 was calculated and discussed. Moreover, to understand the future potential trend of urban sprawl and its spatial pattern, the probability maps were generated by integrating the regression coefficients of the statistically significant predictors into the spatial modeling. For the results performance assessment, the statistic Receiver Operating Characteristic and the pixel-based comparison between the real and predicted data were used. To assess possible differences at spatial and temporal scale, the analysis was carried out at regional level, for two periods: 1990-2002 and 2002-2018. In general, our findings show inverse relationship between the distance driving factors and built-up areas expansion, but the estimated predictive power suggests important disparities within the study area over the analysed periods. Overall, the statistical analysis indicate that the distance to previous build-up areas, distance to road infrastructure, distance to Bucharest and other large urban centres, and distance to urban centres with dominant industrial and service functions were more influential to urban sprawl after 1990. Furthermore, the predicted spatial data shows the highest potential of urban sprawl in the future around Bucharest, in the proximity of existing built-up areas and road infrastructure. Because of its predictive character, the present study is to be a useful tool for land managers and policy makers.

TI  - Use of Hyper-Spectral Visible and Near-Infrared Satellite Data for Timely Estimates of the Earth's Surface Reflectance in Cloudy Conditions: Part 2-Image Restoration With HICO Satellite Data in Overcast Conditions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based visible and near-infrared imaging of the Earth's surface is generally not performed in moderate to highly cloudy conditions; images that look visibly cloud covered to the human eye are typically discarded. Here, we expand upon previous work that employed machine learning (ML) to estimate underlying land surface reflectances at red, green, and blue (RGB) wavelengths in cloud contaminated spectra using a low spatial resolution satellite spectrometer. Specifically, we apply the ML methodology to a case study at much higher spatial resolution with the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) that flew on the International Space Station (ISS). HICO spatial sampling is of the order of 90 m. The purpose of our case study is to test whether high spatial resolution features can be captured using hyper-spectral imaging in lightly cloudy and overcast conditions. We selected one clear and one cloudy image over a portion of the panhandle coastline of Florida to demonstrate that land features are partially recoverable in overcast conditions. Many high contrast features are well recovered in the presence of optically thin clouds. However, some of the low contrast features, such as narrow roads, are smeared out in the heavily clouded part of the reconstructed image. This case study demonstrates that our approach may be useful for many science and operational applications that are being developed for current and upcoming satellite missions including precision agriculture and natural vegetation analysis, water quality assessment, as well as disturbance, change, hazard, and disaster detection.

TI  - Comparison of thresholding methods for shoreline extraction from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery: Extreme Lake Salda, track of Mars on Earth
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Salda's extreme environment is geologically similar to Jezero Crater paleolake on Mars due to the formation of stromatolites and its extremely alkaline and cold water. It is critical to accurately determine the shoreline in the littoral zone where stromatolite formation occurs, in alkaline clean lakes like Salda, which contain traces of life on Mars, and in monitoring the change that occurs with climate and anthropogenic effect. The performance of global automatic thresholding algorithms on shoreline determination from NDWI and mNDWI water indices is compared in this study using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images atmospherically corrected by different algorithms. Satellite images data acquired on August 12, 2020 for Sentinel-2 and August 11, 2020 for Landsat-8 on Lake Salda were used to determining the shoreline. The shoreline data measured in situ concurrently with the Sentinel-2 satellite acquisition was used as reference data. In the accuracy analysis, ground control points created inside and outside the lake at a distance of 1 pixel and 0.5 pixel to the reference shoreline for each satellite image were used. The performance of the optimal threshold values determined by each thresholding algorithm in the water index images was assessed using Kappa coefficient, Overall Accuracy (OA), %OA of Inside (%OA(inside)) and %OA of Outside (%OA(outside)) statistics metrics. The optimal threshold values vary depending on the image and the atmospheric correction algorithm applied to the image. The NDWI index produces more accurate results in both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images. While atmospheric correction algorithms do not affect the results in Landsat-8 images, the Sen2Cor algorithm outperforms iCOR in Sentinel-2 images. For thresholding algorithms to be used in different water index and satellite images, Intermode, Isodata, IJ_Isodata, Minimum and Otsu algorithms in Landsat-8_LaSRC_NDWI and Landsat-8_iCOR_NDWI images, and Intermode, Minimum and Huang algorithms in Sentinel-2_Sen2Cor_NDWI images produce the best results. Because the Minimum algorithm causes significant gaps in the lake surface, the Huang and Intermode algorithms should be used for Sentinel-2_Sen2Cor_NDWI images. The 0 (zero) threshold value in the water indices images has a high accuracy only in the NDWI water indices generated from the Landsat-8 image.

AB  - Geospatial images deliver a visual medium to recognize the prompt changes in the environment influenced due to seasonal changes. These changes extend their impact on the soil vegetation and crop growth patterns leading to an increase/decrease in agricultural production. Identification of seasonal changes and their impact using collected geospatial images within a specific time frame to predict land utilized for agriculture. Although identifying land cover utilization through spectral indices and bands are available, they generalize based on one particular region and may misclassify and overlap each other. The utilization of template matching enables in identifying the crop field area based on templates extracted and labelled. Masked images are acquired randomly from images or existing datasets labelled as fields cropped and barren. The specific region of interest is tiled and demarcated through Semi-supervised classification identifying the annual land crop cover. The extracted images are utilized as masked templates to identify the area of crop cover with an accuracy of 98%. The correlations of land cover helps in identify the specific Region of Interest (ROI) providing maximum and minimum utilization of cultivable lands.

TI  - Estimating Noise Floor in Sentinel-1 Images With Linear Programming and Least Squares
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 is a synthetic aperture radar platform that provides free and open-source images of the Earth. A product type of Sentinel-1 is ground range detected (GRD), which records intensity while discarding phase information from the radar backscatter. Especially in cross-polarized GRD images, there are noticeable intensity changes throughout the image that are caused by amplifying the noise floor of the signal, which varies due to the nonuniform radiation pattern of the satellite's antenna. While Sentinel-1 has instrument processing facility (IPF) software to estimate the noise floor, even in the newer versions (3.1 or above) of the IPF software there are still instances where the estimates provided do not fit the actual noise floor in the image, which is particularly noticeable in transitions between adjacent subswaths. In this work, we propose a method that reduces the impact of the varying noise-floor throughout the image. The method models the intensity of the noise floor to be a power function of the radiation pattern power. The method divides the swath into several sections depending on the location of the local minimum and maximum of the radiation pattern power with respect to the range. The parameter estimation is portrayed as a geometric programming problem that is transformed into a linear programming problem by logarithmic transformation. Affine offsets are computed for each subswath by a weighted least squares approach. Vast improvement is found on extra-wide (EW) and interferometric wide (IW) Sentinel-1 modes over cross-polarized images. Code implementation is available at https://github.com/PeterQLee/sentinel1_denoise_rs.

T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in South Africa following importation and during implementation of stringent lockdown measures.Methods: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt).Findings: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28-49 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R-t was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-2.51).Interpretation: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates. Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Reduced-cost construction of Jacobian matrices for high-resolution inversions of satellite observations of atmospheric composition
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global high-resolution observations of atmospheric composition from satellites can greatly improve our understanding of surface emissions through inverse analyses. Variational inverse methods can optimize surface emissions at any resolution but do not readily quantify the error and information content of the posterior solution. The information content of satellite data may be much lower than its coverage would suggest because of failed retrievals, instrument noise, and error correlations that propagate through the inversion. Analytical solution of the inverse problem provides closed-form characterization of posterior error statistics and information content but requires the construction of the Jacobian matrix that relates emissions to atmospheric concentrations. Building the Jacobian matrix is computationally expensive at high resolution because it involves perturbing each emission element, typically individual grid cells, in the atmospheric transport model used as the forward model for the inversion. We propose and analyze two methods, reduced dimension and reduced rank, to construct the Jacobian matrix at greatly decreased computational cost while retaining information content. Both methods are two-step iterative procedures that begin from an initial native-resolution estimate of the Jacobian matrix constructed at no computational cost by assuming that atmospheric concentrations are most sensitive to local emissions. The reduced-dimension method uses this estimate to construct a Jacobian matrix on a multiscale grid that maintains a high resolution in areas with high information content and aggregates grid cells elsewhere. The reduced-rank method constructs the Jacobian matrix at native resolution by perturbing the leading patterns of information content given by the initial estimate. We demonstrate both methods in an analytical Bayesian inversion of Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) methane data with augmented information content over North America in July 2009. We show that both methods reproduce the results of the native-resolution inversion while achieving a factor of 4 improvement in computational performance. The reduced-dimension method produces an exact solution at a lower spatial resolution, while the reduced-rank method solves the inversion at native resolution in areas of high information content and defaults to the prior estimate elsewhere.

TI  - Ground motion baseline analysis of the Cheshire UK GeoEnergy Observatory
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface geonergy can induce ground motion and seismicity, however a scarcity of observations usually obscures the mechanisms underpinning such behaviour. Here, we analyse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from ERS, ENVISAT and Sentinel-1 satellites for the period 1995-2017 and interpret ground deformation in the area of the planned Cheshire UK GeoEnergy Observatory ahead of facility contruction. Ground motion is dominated by the compaction of tidal flat deposits overlying two paleo-valleys, trending NNW-SSE. The western paleo-valley experienced faster subsidence rates in the period 1995-2007, whereas the eastern paleo-valley subsided faster in the period 2016-2017. The research highlights how baseline assessment can help differentiate natural variation from any anthropogenic effects associated with the growth of new subsurface technologies.

TI  - Daily time series of river water levels derived from a seasonal linear model using multisource satellite products under uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry helps to monitor continental water levels with global coverage and near-real time accessibility. However, a main drawback of satellite altimetry is its low acquisition frequency that hinders the use of altimeters in flood forecasting or reservoir operation processes. This study provides a new method to estimate daily river heights from multisource hydro-climate satellite products without using ground-based data. First, the approach develops a simple statistical model, a seasonal linear model, using satellite altimetry, land surface temperature (LST), satellite precipitation and satellite soil moisture products. Second, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to understand the model accuracy by attributing the model output errors to uncertainties from the multiple satellite products. For the first aim, the study shows that using high-frequency satellite data to improve the temporal resolution of the satellite radar altimetry is better than an approach merging multiple satellite altimetry data. With respect to the second objective, it is found that higher variances are found in seasonal transition periods where there are significant changes in satellite observations. The overall error of the model is attributed to both uncertainties of satellite input data and the interactions among their uncertainties. The results demonstrate the capability of using multisource satellite data to predict daily time series of river heights in data-poor areas. The results also highlight the importance of quantifying uncertainty to increase the reliability of flood forecasting models using satellite products.

TI  - Predicting species distributions and community composition using satellite remote sensing predictors
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity is rapidly changing due to changes in the climate and human related activities; thus, the accurate predictions of species composition and diversity are critical to developing conservation actions and management strategies. In this paper, using satellite remote sensing products as covariates, we constructed stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) under a Bayesian framework to build next-generation biodiversity models. Model performance of these models was assessed using oak assemblages distributed across the continental United States obtained from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). This study represents an attempt to evaluate the integrated predictions of biodiversity models-including assemblage diversity and composition-obtained by stacking next-generation SDMs. We found that applying constraints to assemblage predictions, such as using the probability ranking rule, does not improve biodiversity prediction models. Furthermore, we found that independent of the stacking procedure (bS-SDM versus pS-SDM versus cS-SDM), these kinds of next-generation biodiversity models do not accurately recover the observed species composition at the plot level or ecological-community scales (NEON plots are 400 m(2)). However, these models do return reasonable predictions at macroecological scales, i.e., moderately to highly correct assignments of species identities at the scale of NEON sites (mean area similar to 27 km(2)). Our results provide insights for advancing the accuracy of prediction of assemblage diversity and composition at different spatial scales globally. An important task for future studies is to evaluate the reliability of combining S-SDMs with direct detection of species using image spectroscopy to build a new generation of biodiversity models that accurately predict and monitor ecological assemblages through time and space.

TI  - PALM BRUISING IN INFANTS: A RECOGNIZABLE PATTERN OF ABUSE
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bruising in an infant is an important sentinel injury that should raise concern for child physical abuse, and should prompt a medical evaluation for occult injury. Hyperflexion during forceful squeezing of an infant's hand results in a distinct pattern of bruising along the palmar and interdigital creases, as well as the palmar eminences. Self-inflicted injury by the infant or injury resulting from benign handling should not be accepted as plausible explanations for this injury. The presence of concurrent occult injuries is common, and further supports concerns for abuse. However, when this distinct pattern of palm bruising is identified in an infant, the absence of occult injuries should not prevent the recognition of child physical abuse. Case Report: We report 11 cases depicting this distinct pattern of palm bruising in infants. Additionally, we include a perpetrator's documented confession. To the best of our knowledge, this pattern of bruising has not been previously described in the medical literature. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Emergency physicians play a crucial role in recognizing and addressing child physical abuse. Prompt recognition of this finding can aid in the identification of child physical abuse, even in the absence of underlying occult injury. This, in turn, can potentially prevent further injury, and even death, of an infant. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - How do methodological choices influence estimation of river metabolism?
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - River metabolism modeled from diurnal dissolved oxygen (DO) has become a widely used metric of ecosystem function, yet many papers provide insufficient methodological detail for replication. Only 79% of 43 sampled papers published from 2015 to 2019 mention calibration, 44% describe sensor placement, and 34% did not describe estimation approaches such that the study could be replicated. Given spatial heterogeneity in rivers influences metabolism, and measurement sensitivities vary with sensor model, it is important to have appropriately detailed information in reported methods along with a fundamental understanding of how river heterogeneity might influence metabolism. We deployed 2-8 sensors at 92 steppe river reaches to characterize site heterogeneity, evaluating how sensor placement and type, deployment length, drift correction, data source, local vs. remotely sensed data, and calibration can affect metabolism estimates. Estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were inconsistent and unpredictable depending on deployment location within a river reach; GPP and ER rates varied up to 131% and 69%, respectively, across a river width and up to two orders of magnitude within a reach. DO sensor brands vary in precision and accuracy; we found even when operated within stated performance range, estimates of GPP and ER could vary by 82% and 198%, respectively, if not calibrated beyond factory setting, as determined using field data from a sample site. Inaccuracies from sensor drift over weeklong deployments led to an average 48% ER overestimation, and 2% GPP overestimation comparing uncorrected with corrected field data. We suggest best practices for more comparable, precise, representative, and accurate methods.

TI  - Physical Abuse Creating Cauliflower Ear in an Infant: A Discussion of Mechanism and Review of the Literature
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY AND HEAD & NECK SURGERY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We evaluated an infant with flagrantly abusive injury. However, he had a history of prior isolated ear hematoma that was not properly recognized as a sign of trauma, harshly illustrating a missed opportunity when early diagnosis may have prevented escalating abusive injury. In addition, we reviewed and summarized the last two decades of literature related to this topic to better understand previously described findings in similar populations; these were scant. This case report emphasizes the importance of detecting sentinel injuries that forebode child maltreatment.

TI  - The Emerging Drugs Network of Australia: A toxicosurveillance system of illicit and emerging drugs in the emergency department
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The unprecedented rise in synthetic drugs, many containing unknown toxic agents, has made timely analytical diagnosis more difficult, and has reduced the confidence of clinicians providing ED management to this population of patients. This has also impacted the quality of evidence informing harm reduction responses. The Emerging Drugs Network of Australia (EDNA) brings together emergency physicians, toxicologists and forensic laboratories to establish a standardised ED toxicosurveillance system in Australia. Methods Blood analysis of intoxicated patients will be conducted by forensic laboratories to enable precise identification of the substances causing acute toxicity. This will be linked with clinical data collected at the time of ED presentation to enable analysis of the clinical effects and outcomes associated with different illicit and emerging drugs. Toxicological and clinical data collected across sentinel sites will align with a nationally endorsed minimum dataset. Results EDNA's collaborative network will establish a national system of surveillance and reporting of illicit and emerging drugs causing acute toxicity. Standardisation of data collection recorded in a national clinical registry will provide more robust data on epidemiology and associated harms. This will facilitate the translation of clinical and toxicological evidence into timely, appropriate harm reduction and policy. Conclusion Our work represents a collaborative response to calls for more sophisticated data on emerging drug trends in Australia. EDNA will improve coordination between clinicians and analytical services by way of its standardised approach to surveillance and reporting.

TI  - Variations in esker morphology and internal architecture record time-transgressive deposition during ice margin retreat in Northern Ireland
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The architecture and evolution of the subglacial hydrological system plays a key role in modulating ice flow. Eskers provide an opportunity to understand subglacial hydrology at a broader perspective than contemporary studies. Recent research has established a morphogenetic classification for eskers, but these studies have been limited to topographically simple regions of a single ice sheet. We present an updated map of esker distribution in Northern Ireland based on 5-m resolution elevation data. We also present a high-resolution map of the glacial geomorphology of SW Northern Ireland, based on -0.4-m resolution elevation data. Ground Penetrating Radar data from four sites along the >20-km long Evishanoran Esker system in central Northern Ireland are combined with geomorphological observations to provide insight into depositional processes and controls on esker formation. Esker architecture indicates two styles of deposition, including an initial high energy flow event in a subglacial conduit and delta foreset deposition close to the ice sheet margin during ice margin retreat. These delta foresee deposits can be used to reconstruct former ice margins. We identify that local topographic complexity and geological structures (e.g., faults) are important controls on esker formation. The broad-scale esker architecture remains the same despite variable esker planform morphology, suggesting hydrological conditions alone cannot explain esker morphology. This study provides further evidence that morphogenetic relationships cannot be based solely on remote sensing data and must be supported by robust field observations, especially where post-glacial processes may distort esker morphology (e.g., pear infilling).

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal characteristics of urban heat islands from the perspective of an urban expansion and green infrastructure
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) effect is a common urban problem in the process of rapid urbanization. It is also widely considered as one of the most critical global problems in the 21st century. The UHI effect poses a severe challenge to the sustainable development strategy of cities, the living environment of urban residents and the livability of cities. In the context of urban planning and landscape design, how to mitigate the UHI effect and how to help urban residents adapt are one of research topics on urban thermal environments. With Landsat thermal sensor images, this study retrieved urban land surface temperature (LST), and revealed spatiotemporal characteristics of surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect from the perspective of urban expansion and urban green infrastructure. The results indicate that the Hangzhou city SUHI effect was prominent. From 1990 to 2010, the high-grade SUHI effect area tended to move to the north, while from 2010 to 2018, the high-grade SUHI effect area tended to move to the south, which was consistent with the direction of urban expansion. Urban edge-expansion led to continuous expansion of urban scope, and urban center was dominated by infilling expansion. The core area of green infrastructure in the city center was small, and the ecological corridor was reduced, which intensified the SUHI effect of the city center. In different time periods, the relationship between SUHI effect, urban expansion and urban green infrastructure was different. The analysis results derived from this study were considered valuable for urban planners and landscape designers to alleviate the SUHI effect, build an ecological civilization city and construct a "livable city".

TI  - Contribution Degree of Different Surface Factors in Urban Interior to Urban Thermal Environment
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution degree of different surface factors (complexity and heterogeneity) in the urban interior to the urban thermal environment has become an issue of increasing concern under changing climate. In this paper, the multiple linear regression analysis methods to analyze the contribution degree of different surface factors to the urban thermal environment were based on seven urban built-up areas. At the same time, the LST of the same type of factors in the same city will have a difference of +/- 2.5 degrees C due to the different surrounding features. At the same time, the LST of the same ground object in the same city will be +/- 2.5 degrees C different because of the difference of the surrounding ground object. The environmental LST and the mean LST of other surface factors were significantly correlated, and the root mean square error was 3.52. This study first classifies the ground features with different attributes, conducts LST statistics for each category, and conducts multivariate linear analysis, instead of setting some fuzzy exponent and forcing a threshold to calculate. The purpose is to explore the contribution of different reflectivity ground objects to the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Atmospheric correction over coastal waters with aerosol properties constrained by multi-pixel observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an innovative multi-pixel atmospheric correction approach (MPACA) to process high-spatialresolution satellite measurements over coastal waters based on a revised POLYMER model. MPACA assumes the aerosol type to be uniform within a relatively small region, while the aerosol load and water properties are allowed to vary. Landsat-8 OLI images over six coastal locations with various turbidities were utilized to evaluate the performance of MPACA. The retrieved remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) by MPACA is validated with in situ matchups obtained from two sources: ship-based field campaigns and the AERONET-OC networks. It is found that, at each of OLI's four visible bands, MPACA provided accurate R-rs(lambda) products over such coastal environments, with the Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) and Mean Absolute Percentage Difference (MAPD) less than 0.0006 sr(-1) and 16.2%, respectively. In contrast, the R-rs(lambda) values retrieved with NASA's SeaDAS (v7.5), where each pixel was treated independently, showed RMSD and MAPD as similar to 0.0018 sr(-1) and similar to 38.8%, respectively. Acolite-DSF, which assumed some spatial dependency, obtained MAPD almost two times that of SeaDAS for each visible band. Further, it appears that Acolite-EXP did not perform well for this evaluation dataset, where RMSD is similar to 0.0062 sr(-1) and MAPD is similar to 228.2%. These results suggest that MPACA is a promising scheme for atmospheric correction in coastal waters, especially for measurements from multi-band satellites that have a high spatial resolution along with at least two bands in the NIR or SWIR domain.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of pelagic Sargassum macroalgae: The power of high resolution and deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, massive blooms of pelagic Sargassum have occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, and satellite imagery have been used operationally to monitor and track the blooms. However, limited by the coarse resolution and other confounding factors, there is often a data gap in nearshore waters, and the uncertainties in the estimated Sargassum abundance in offshore waters are also unclear. Higher-resolution satellite data may overcome these limitations, yet such a potential is hindered by the lack of reliable methods to accurately detect and quantify Sargassum in an automatic fashion. Here, we address this challenge by combining large quantities of high-resolution satellite data with deep learning. Specifically, data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI, 10-20 m), Operational Land Imager (OLI, 30 m), WorldView-II (WV-2, 2 m), and PlanetScope/Dove (3 m) are used with a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to extract Sargassum features and quantify Sargassum biomass density or areal coverage. By utilizing the U-net architecture and the pre-trained weights from the VGG16 model, the DCNN (i.e., the VGGUnet model) can extract Sargassum features while discarding other confusing features (waves, currents, phytoplankton blooms, clouds, cloud shadows, or striping noise). For Sargassum biomass estimated from OLI and MSI images, results indicate an accuracy of -92% and 90%, respectively, when evaluated using images from the same sensor. When Sargassum areal coverage is estimated from WV-2 and Dove images, there is an accuracy of -98% and 82%, respectively. When different sensors are cross-compared, OLI reveals -30% more Sargassum biomass than MODIS from 14 OLI images collected in the Caribbean Sea (path/row: 001/050) for their commonly viewed observable areas, and - 180% more Sargassum biomass than MSI (N = 15, path/row: 001/050); such differences appear systematic (R2 = 0.98 and 0.73, respectively). Compared to the quasi-simultaneous MSI, OLI, and MODIS images, Dove shows higher Sargassum coverage. Higher-resolution sensors tend to observe more Sargassum because they can detect smaller-scale features that are missed by the coarser-resolution sensors, although the difference varies with time and location. The morphological characteristics of Sargassum features from these high-resolution data are also reported to facilitate management actions. The findings here not only fill the knowledge gaps and coverage gaps from previous studies, but more importantly pave the road toward operational monitoring and tracking Sargassum features in nearshore waters.

TI  - Cultivating Spiritual Intelligence for a participatory worldview: The contribution of Archetypal Cosmology
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanity finds itself in a collective liminal space between worldviews, on a trajectory from a dominant scientific materialism towards a participative worldview informed by a spiritual and archetypal consciousness. This paper suggests that Spiritual Intelligence (SQ), the cognitive ability to find higher meaning, value, and purpose in life through transcending rational intelligence may help to birth and reinforce the emerging worldview. The dominant modes of thinking embedded within educational institutions, however, remain within the confines of the mechanistic-materialist model. Nurturing SQ requires multiple ways of knowing, a pedagogy based on engaging the head, heart and accessing our inner experience and intuitive voice. This paper identifies one recent expression of a participative worldview - Archetypal Cosmology - that is not only consistent with post-materialist views of consciousness but can also contribute to cultivating and developing SQ. Archetypal Cosmology is based on an enchanted cosmos in which the microcosm of the psyche is reflected in the macrocosm of the universe through a mysterious yet empirically observable planetary synchronicity. After reviewing the key tenets of SQ and Archetypal Cosmology, the paper: (i) highlights a correspondence between the principles of SQ and the planetary archetypal meanings suggesting that SQ may be a type of Archetypal Intelligence; (ii) illustrates how Archetypal Cosmology provides another mode to cultivate SQ; (iii) suggests that the synthesis of SQ and Archetypal Cosmology, both multi-sensory ways of knowing that include the imaginal, symbolic, mythical and spiritual, may help bring about new modes of thinking to bridge the sciences and humanities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of remote sensing and GIS is increasing in importance across the world for disaster preparedness, assessments, mitigation, and governance. A major focus is on extracting and disseminating useful information from satellite and airborne data sources for effective planning and decision making during and after disasters. This study presents a case study from Ko-Rian, a sub-district in Ayutthaya, Thailand which is frequently hit by monsoon flooding. First, an approach is demonstrated to extract buildings and roads from very-high-resolution satellite images. The results showed that use of selected multiple indices with object-based image analysis produced excellent results in mixed urban environment. Secondly, a procedure and framework are proposed for geodatabase modeling of urban flood vulnerability and disseminating information to a wider community through ESRI story maps. The proposed approach using virtual reality technologies such as Google Street View for assessing physical vulnerability and ESRI story maps to share the information can significantly reduce the time and costs of the traditional survey. The techniques and approach presented in this study can be useful to develop detailed vulnerability profile for effective decision making and dynamic planning for a flood resilient city.

TI  - Monitoring surface deformations of the reclamation site using PS interferometry: Senol Gunes sport complex (Turkey)
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, structures, built on reclamation sites in the Eastern Black Sea region are quite remarkable. As one of them, Senol Gunes Medical Park Arena Sport Complex, which is located in Akyazi town of Trabzon city, is one of the rare areas in Turkey. It is very important to monitor surface deformations on this type of unfamiliar and very expensive constructions for protecting human life and property and for taking necessary precautions in advance. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), based on the analysis of time series of multiple Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, is an invaluable geodetic tool to measure surface deformations. So, in this study, it is aimed to monitor the surface deformations on the reclamation site between the dates 20/12/2016-28/01/2020 by StaMPS (Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers)-PSI technique using 96 Sentinel-1 SAR images. For processing, integration of European Space Agency (ESA) SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) and StaMPS programs are used. After processing, surface deformations are determined as annual velocities (millimeter(mm)/year(y)) of PS points in the reclamation area along the line-of-sight (LOS) direction between the values -9.7 mm/y and 3.9 mm/y with an average standard deviation of 0.7 mm/y. From the results, it is understood that the area demonstrates very heterogeneous deformations rates, which occur on both horizontal and vertical directions because of the diversity and being on the reclamation site of the structures.

Comparisons against TCO measurements from the ground-based Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometer networks are used to remove offsets and drifts between the ground-based measurements and a subset of the satellite-based measurements. The corrected subset is then used as a basis for homogenizing the remaining data sets. The construction of this database improves on earlier versions of the database maintained first by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and now by Bodeker Scientific (BS), referred to as the NIWA-BS TCO database. The intention is for the NIWA-BS TCO database to serve as a climate data record for TCO, and to this end, the requirements for constructing climate data records, as detailed by GCOS (the Global Climate Observing System), have been followed as closely as possible.This new version includes a wider range of satellite-based instruments, uses updated sources of satellite data, extends the period covered, uses improved statistical methods to model the difference fields when homogenizing the data sets, and, perhaps most importantly, robustly tracks uncertainties from the source data sets through to the final climate data record which is now accompanied by associated uncertainty fields. Furthermore, a gap-free TCO database (referred to as the BS-filled TCO database) has been created and is documented in this paper. The utility of the NIWA-BS TCO database is demonstrated through an analysis of ozone trends from November 1978 to December 2016.

TI  - Determining the host range of <i>Diadromus collari</i>s (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a candidate biological control agent for diamondback moth Plutella xylostella linnaeus (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in Canada
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Before a non-native agent is introduced for the classical biological control of a pest, its host specificity must be determined. We assessed the host specificity of Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a solitary pupal endoparasitoid being considered for biological control of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in Canada. In black-box no-choice tests on nine non-target species, D. collaris successfully parasitized other species in the genus Plutella (the introduced Plutella porrectella Linnaeus and the native Plutella armoraciae Busck) as well as another introduced agricultural pest, the leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Glyphipterigidae). This suggests that the fundamental host range of D. collaris includes other species in the Plutellidae, as well as Glyphipterigidae that are ecologically and morphologically similar to diamondback moth. Field tests in Switzerland comparing parasitism by D. collaris on sentinel diamondback moth pupae and leek moth pupae in both canola and leek fields revealed no parasitism of leek moth in leek fields, indicating that the ecological host range of D. collaris is in fact more restricted. Because of this, it would be premature to discount D. collaris as a potential biological control agent for diamondback moth in Canada.

TI  - Ecohydrological interactions in a boreal fen-swamp complex, Alberta, Canada
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Western Boreal Plain (WBP) comprises a diverse array of wetland types; however, swamps are understudied in the WBP relative to other wetlands, despite their ubiquity. We apply an ecohydrological and GIS-based research approach at a fen-swamp complex in the WBP to characterize the ecohydrological properties of the varying wetland types and relate these interactions to the hydrologic function of the watershed. In this study, we evaluate 3 years of hydrological monitoring data, with additional hydrochemical, vegetation and remote sensing data. In our analyses, we identified five land types: fen, flat peat swamp and peat margin swamp (peatlands), mineral swamp and upland. Flat peat swamp was distinguished from fen using Ducks Unlimited criteria, stating fens cannot have trees >10 m in height. Little difference in water table variability, groundwater connectivity, vegetation composition and water chemistry were found between flat peat swamp and fen, suggesting that for all practical purposes, they can be considered a single unit and tree height alone cannot be used to differentiate these peatland types. In contrast, peat margin swamps exhibited lower and more variable water tables and consistent downward hydraulic gradients and comprised a mixture of peatland and upland vegetation. Peat margin swamps, however, exhibited similar porewater pH, electrical conductivity and base cation concentrations as upland, flat peat swamp and fen, suggesting that they are well connected hydrologically. Peat margin swamps were also found to modulate subsurface water movement between fen and upland (via reduced transmissivity from lower water tables) and therefore act as distinct ecohydrological units.

TI  - A novel crop classification method based on ppfSVM classifier with time-series alignment kernel from dual-polarization SAR datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate crop type mapping is of great significance for agricultural management and sustainable development. Time-series multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is suitable for obtaining the large-scale distribution of crop types and continuously monitoring crops. At present, the classification method based on the time-series alignment of time-varying feature curves has been widely used, which can take the uncertainty of the phenological cycles of crops into account. The most classical method is the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment. While the DTW alignment does not consider the local shape of the curves and temporal ranges, and the NN classifier is inadequate in generalization, which restricts the accuracy of crop type mapping. In this paper, a pairwise proximity function support vector machine (ppfSVM) classification method with the time-weighted shapeDTW (TWshapeDTW) alignment is proposed. Firstly, the novel alignment method simultaneously considers the local shape of the curve and the temporal range of crops. Besides, the novel ppfSVM classifier with the time-series alignment kernel is established. Such kernel matrix considers dual-similarity metrics of multiple features, and it is positive semi-definite (PSD) in this classifier. With 42 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR images located in Gansu Province, China, the crop classification maps in 2018 and 2019 are generated respectively. The proposed method in this paper obtains the overall accuracies of more than 90% in both two years, and the changes of crop types from 2018 to 2019 are also in line with the actual crop rotation. Compared with traditional classification methods (SVM and the NN method with the DTW alignment), it is found that the proposed method has higher overall accuracy (OA) and better robustness in the case of small number of samples. The OA's improvements of our method compared with the SVM method are 3% and 1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Such improvements are 14% and 12% respect to the NN method with the DTW alignment. This method can achieve more obvious improvement under the condition of less training samples and unaligned phenological sequences. Furthermore, the novel TWshapeDTW alignment is superior to the DTW and the time-weighted DTW alignment under the ppfSVM classifier. The OA's improvement introduced by the TWshapeDTW alignment respect to the DTW alignment can obtain 5% and 4% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

TI  - Resilience of wetland vegetation to recurrent drought in the Inland Niger Delta of Mali from 1982 to 2014
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of vegetation to variable flood regimes is an important research question for floodplains in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa experiencing climate change. The Inland Niger Delta (IND), located within the Sahelian zone of Central Mali, is a large floodplain that has experienced a historically-significant period of recurrent drought from 1970 to 1994 followed by a recovery of floods since. Vegetation associations, as determined through 2014 fieldwork at 538 IND sites, were compared to the sites' vegetation associations as mapped in 1982. Site-specific flood histories were constructed through the analysis of Landsat imagery across the 1982-2014 period. In more deeply flooded portions of the floodplain, observations of vegetation associations in 2014 show remarkable consistency with those existing in 1982. In areas flooded infrequently and for the shortest duration, vegetation trajectories are more complicated with evidence for bush encroachment noted at 4.5% of all sites. Flood history explains only a portion of the few site-specific changes observed over the study period. Significant changes were more likely to be associated with more recent flood history (post 1999) rather than the flood history during the preceding abnormally dry period (1982-1991). These findings point to remarkable resiliency of IND vegetation to widely fluctuating levels of flooding that are driven not only by rainfall and run-off across the watershed but also by land use, water withdrawals and damming upstream. Given the low species diversity of IND vegetation, its resiliency derives from the combination of the seasonal plasticity of perennial grass growth in relation to rainfall and flood regimes and the efficiency of their vegetative and reproductive propagation in the context of highly seasonal grazing. The co-occurrence of interannual resiliency of the IND vegetation with annual vegetation production varying significantly with annual rainfall-flood conditions is consistent with non-equilibrium ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - Surgical Axillary Staging Before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Who Gets It and Why We Should Avoid It
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Surgical axillary staging demonstrating positive nodal disease before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) necessitates axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) post-NAC. Despite evidence supporting post-NAC surgical staging, we hypothesized that there is persistent use of pre-NAC staging and that it is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and a higher rate of subsequent ALND. Patients and Methods Stage I-III breast cancer patients who underwent lymph node staging surgery and received NAC between 2013 and 2017 in the National Cancer Database were included. Sequence of staging surgery and chemotherapy administration was determined. Multivariable regression was used to assess characteristics associated with pre-NAC staging. Rate of ALND was compared between those who had pre- and post-NAC surgical axillary staging. Results In total, 120,538 met inclusion; 68% received NAC first and 32% had pre-NAC staging. Pre-NAC staging surgery was associated with younger age (age < 30 versus 40-49 years, HR 1.1) and decreased with older age (ages 70-79/80+ versus 40-49 years, HR 0.86 and 0.73). Advancing clinical T stage, lobular subtype, higher grade, and HR+/HER2- subtype were also associated with pre-NAC surgical staging. Women who underwent pre-NAC surgical staging were more likely to undergo ALND. Conclusions Over 30% of women underwent surgical axillary staging prior to NAC, resulting in higher rates of ALND in this cohort. While certain features suggestive of aggressive behavior (grade and T stage) were associated with pre-NAC surgical axillary staging, women with more aggressive tumor subtypes (triple negative/HER2+) were less likely to undergo pre-NAC surgical axillary staging. Pre-NAC surgical axillary staging should be performed only in rare circumstances to avoid unnecessary ALND.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 infects blood monocytes to activate NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, pyroptosis and cytokine release.
T2  - Research square
M3  - Preprint
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress that can progress to multiorgan failure and death in a minority of patients. Although severe COVID-19 disease is linked to exuberant inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not understood. Monocytes and macrophages are sentinel immune cells in the blood and tissue, respectively, that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of IL-1 family cytokines, potent inflammatory mediators. Here we show that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to higher GSDMD expression increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio, 1.3, p<0.005). We find that about 10% of blood monocytes in COVID-19 patients are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection depends on viral antibody opsonization and uptake of opsonized virus by the Fc receptor CD16. After uptake, SARS-CoV-2 begins to replicate in monocytes, as evidenced by detection of double-stranded RNA and subgenomic RNA and expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. However, infection is aborted, and infectious virus is not detected in infected monocyte supernatants or patient plasma. Instead, infected cells undergo inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) mediated by activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and GSDMD. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages, but not infected epithelial cells, from COVID-19 lung autopsy specimens showed evidence of inflammasome activation. These findings taken together suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes/macrophages triggers inflammatory cell death that aborts production of infectious virus but causes systemic inflammation that contributes to severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Post-Hurricane Vegetative Debris Assessment Using Spectral Indices Derived from Satellite Imagery
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Transportation systems are vulnerable to hurricanes and yet their recovery plays a critical role in returning a community to its pre-hurricane state. Vegetative debris is among the most significant causes of disruptions on transportation infrastructure. Therefore, identifying the driving factors of hurricane-caused debris generation can help clear roadways faster and improve the recovery time of infrastructure systems. Previous studies on hurricane debris assessment are generally based on field data collection, which is expensive, time consuming, and dangerous. With the availability and convenience of remote sensing powered by the simple yet accurate estimations on the vigor of vegetation or density of manufactured features, spectral indices can change the way that emergency planners prepare for and perform vegetative debris removal operations. Thus, this study proposes a data fusion framework combining multispectral satellite imagery and various vector data to evaluate post-hurricane vegetative debris with an exploratory analysis in small geographical units. Actual debris removal data were obtained from the City of Tallahassee, Florida after Hurricane Michael (2018) and aggregated into U.S. Census Block Groups along with four groups of datasets representing vegetation, storm surge, land use, and socioeconomics. Findings suggest that vegetation and other land characteristics are more determinant factors on debris generation, and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) outperforms other vegetation indices for hurricane debris assessment. The proposed framework can help better identify equipment stack locations and temporary debris collection centers while providing resilience enhancements with a focus on the transportation infrastructure.

TI  - <i>TESS</i> survey of rotational and pulsational variability of mercury-manganese stars
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars are late-B upper main sequence chemically peculiar stars distinguished by large overabundances of heavy elements, slow rotation, and frequent membership in close binary systems. These stars lack strong magnetic fields typical of magnetic Bp stars but occasionally exhibit non-uniform surface distributions of chemical elements. The physical origin and the extent of this spot formation phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we use 2-min cadence light curves of 64 HgMn stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during the first 2 yr of its operation to investigate the incidence of rotational modulation and pulsations among HgMn stars. We found rotational variability with amplitudes of 0.1-3 mmag in 84 percent of the targets, indicating ubiquitous presence of star-spots on HgMn-star surfaces. Rotational period measurements reveal six fast-rotating stars with periods below 1.2 d, including one ultra-fast rotator (HD14228) with a 0.34-d period. We also identify several HgMn stars showing multiperiodic g-mode pulsations, tidally induced variation and eclipses in binary systems.

TI  - Do high-resolution satellite indices at field level reduce basis risk of satellite-based weather index insurance?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Satellite-based weather index insurance has recently been considered in order to reduce the high basis risk of station-based weather index insurance. However, the use of satellite data with a relatively low spatial resolution has not yet made it possible to determine the satellite indices free of disturbing landscape elements such as mountains, forests and lakes. Design/methodology/approach In this context, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used based on both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (250 x 250 m) and high-resolution Landsat 5/8 (30 x 30 m) images to investigate the effect of a higher spatial resolution of satellite-based weather index contracts for hedging winter wheat yields. For three farms in north-east Germany, insurance contracts both at field and farm level were designed. Findings The results indicate that with an increasing spatial resolution of satellite data, the basis risk of satellite-based weather index insurance contracts can be reduced. However, the results also show that the design of NDVI-based insurance contracts at farm level also reduces the basis risk compared to field level. The study shows that higher-resolution satellite data are advantageous, whereas satellite indices at field level do not reduce the basis risk. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, the effect of increasing spatial resolution of satellite images for satellite-based weather index insurance is investigated for the first time at the field level compared to the farm level.

TI  - Assessing salt marsh loss and degradation by combining long-term LANDSAT imagery and numerical modelling
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise evaluation of the conservation status of salt marshes, the understanding of the mechanisms behind loss and degradation and the anticipation of future threats are fundamental to assist management solutions able to reverse the declining trend observed in these environments. Previous methods combining remote sensing and hydrodynamic modelling have been revealed to be effective in assessing degradation in restricted marshes, but unable to characterise dynamics of marshes at the estuarine scale. This study proposes an alternative methodology to identify priority areas for conservation by combining LANDSAT satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling. Using the Ria de Aveiro as case-study, the main objectives of this work are to: (1) identify vegetation loss and degradation in estuarine marshes; (2) determine the mechanisms behind marsh deterioration; (3) anticipate future threats posed by climate-induced mean sea level rise and; (4) provide management solutions aiming to protect and recover degraded salt marshes. LANDSAT imagery reveals that the most deteriorated salt marshes are located on the central and upper lagoon regions, and the numerical results support that marsh loss and degradation result from the increased tidal action triggered by the deepening of the lagoon channels. The increase in tidal currents promoted the erosion of marsh shoreline, whereas the changes in the inundation patterns over the intertidal areas triggered interior drowning. Climate-induced mean sea level rise will likely exacerbate marsh deterioration, increasing the urgency to implement a management plan aiming to protect marshes from erosion and promote sedimentation in submerged marshes, to ensure their sustainability.

TI  - Digital terrain model elevation corrections using space-based imagery and ICESat-2 laser altimetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The most prevalent global surface models are derived from space-based technologies. The spatial and temporal coverage of radar and imaging systems have significant advantage over other sensors and platforms. However, these systems are often are challenged in certain environmental conditions to produce accurate elevations as compared to what might achieved with laser altimetry. Radar derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model) elevation accuracy is often less in vegetated regions, as the wavelengths associated with radar mapping missions do not fully penetrate the canopy. Elevation errors are also substantial over dynamic topography. Correction models using airborne lidar reference datasets can be effective for localized studies to improve the DEM but often the data is not readily available or seasonally/temporally irrelevant. This work presents an automated method for correcting digital terrain models derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation products using NASA's newest Earth observing laser altimeter, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). ICESat-2 elevations, in concert with Landsat 8 (global imagery), create a model based correction strategy for the SRTM derived elevations using geographically correlated canopy cover and surface slope information. The results are validated at the study site using high-resolution, high fidelity airborne lidar datasets as a reference surface. The application of the correction model on the radar measurements results in nearly 50% improvement in elevation accuracy for this region. Additionally this established proof of concept provides a starting point for further research in how this method, with ICESat-2 data, can be extended to other environmental regions, other radar or image derived elevation products and inform future techniques for similar application at the global scale.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of three techniques for monitoring the establishment and spread of larval parasitoids recently introduced for biological control of emerald ash borer,<i> Agrilus</i><i> planipennis</i> (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared three detection methods for two larval parasitoids introduced for the control of the emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae): Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenop-tera: Eulophidae) and Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazanac (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). The three methods compared were 1) debarking the lower 2 m of ash trees, 2) yellow pan traps (YPT), and 3) sentinel logs containing manually inserted late-instar EAB larvae. The parasitoids studied were released in a mixed hardwood forest in Cromwell, Connecticut from 2015 to 2017 and had established self-sustaining populations before this experiment. In 2019, we deployed all three detection methods along two transects (4.6 km and 5.7 km long, respectively) radiating out from the parasitoid release area. All three methods detected both parasitoid species. Each parasitoid was detected at the furthest transect point of at least one of the transects. Sentinel logs were the most efficient method for capturing T. planipennisi, with a labor requirement of 2.4 h/detection (139 h/57 broods). Debarking, in contrast, was the most efficient method for S. galinae, with a labor requirement of 3.6 h/ detection (172 h/48 broods). YPT were the least efficient technique, capturing only 15 T. planipennisi and 9 S. galinae wasps for the entire trapping period at Cromwell, a labor requirement of 18.7 h/per detection (280 h/ 15 adults) and 31.1 h/detection (280 h/9 adults), respectively. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these three techniques.

TI  - The global forest above-ground biomass pool for 2010 estimated from high-resolution satellite observations
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial forest carbon pool is poorly quantified, in particular in regions with low forest inventory capacity. By combining multiple satellite observations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter around the year 2010, we generated a global, spatially explicit dataset of above-ground live biomass (AGB; dry mass) stored in forests with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Using an extensive database of 110 897 AGB measurements from field inventory plots, we show that the spatial patterns and magnitude of AGB are well captured in our map with the exception of regional uncertainties in high-carbon-stock forests with AGB > 250 Mg ha(-1), where the retrieval was effectively based on a single radar observation. With a total global AGB of 522 Pg, our estimate of the terrestrial biomass pool in forests is lower than most estimates published in the literature (426-571 Pg). Nonetheless, our dataset increases knowledge on the spatial distribution of AGB compared to the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and highlights the impact of a country's national inventory capacity on the accuracy of the biomass statistics reported to the FRA. We also reassessed previous remote sensing AGB maps and identified major biases compared to inventory data, up to 120% of the inventory value in dry tropical forests, in the subtropics and temperate zone. Because of the high level of detail and the overall reliability of the AGB spatial patterns, our global dataset of AGB is likely to have significant impacts on climate, carbon, and socio-economic modelling schemes and provides a crucial baseline in future carbon stock change estimates.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Hydrologic models predict the spatial and temporal distribution of water and energy at the land surface. Currently, parameter availability limits global-scale hydrologic modelling to very coarse resolution, hindering researchers from resolving fine-scale variability. With the aim of addressing this problem, we present a set of globally consistent soil and vegetation parameters for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model at 1/16 degrees resolution (approximately 6 km at the equator), with spatial coverage from 60 degrees S to 85 degrees N. Soil parameters derived from interpolated soil profiles and vegetation parameters estimated from space-based MODIS measurements have been compiled into input files for both the Classic and Image drivers of the VIC model, version 5. Geographical subsetting codes are provided, as well. Our dataset provides all necessary land surface parameters to run the VIC model at regional to global scale. We evaluate VICGlobal's ability to simulate the water balance in the Upper Colorado River basin and 12 smaller basins in the CONUS, and their ability to simulate the radiation budget at six SURFRAD stations in the CONUS.

TI  - DNN-MET: A deep neural networks method to integrate satellite-derived evapotranspiration products, eddy covariance observations and ancillary information
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of the spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration (ET) are essential for understanding terrestrial energy, carbon and water cycles. Station-based observations are limited for their spatial coverage whereas satellite-derived ET products exhibit large discrepancies and uncertainties. Here we presented a Deep Neural Networks based Merging ET (DNN-MET) framework that combines information from satellite-derived ET products, eddy covariance (EC) observations and ancillary surface properties to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal distribution of ET, especially in data-sparse regions. DNN-MET was implemented over the Heihe River Basin (HRB) from 2008 to 2015, and the performance of DNN-MET and eight input state-of-the-art satellite-derived ET products (i.e., MOD16, ET-SEMI, ET-JPL, ET-MS, ET-HF, GLEAM, ETMonitor and EB-ET) was evaluated against observations from 19 EC flux tower sites. The results showed that DNN-MET improved ET estimates over HRB, and decreased the RMSE by 0.13 to 1.02 mm/day (14%-56%) when compared with eight products. DNN-MET also yielded superior performance compared to the products derived by other merging methods (i.e., Random Forest, Bayesian model averaging and a simple averaging method). When DNN-MET was validated for data-scarce regions, its performance remained better even when the training samples were decreased to 20% of the available EC sites. An innovation of our approach is by building a multivariate merging model with ancillary surface properties, DNN-MET incorporated geographical proximity effects and spatial autocorrelations into merging procedure, which can be used as a "spatial knowledge engine" to improve ET predictions. The approach can be readily and effectively applied elsewhere to improve the spatiotemporal representation of various hydrometeorological variables.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the impact of climatic factors on phenological changes in the Qilian Mountains, China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems are highly susceptible to climate change. The climate tends to be warm and wet in the arid mountains of China because of the intensified water cycle under global warming, and the vegetation is undergoing profound changes. However, how vegetation phenology responds to climate change is not been entirely understood. Using MODIS-NDVI during 2000-2019, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in the SOS, EOS, and LOS in the Qilian Mountains (QLMs), China. These parameters were extracted using four methods, and geographic detector model was used to quantify the explanatory power of climatic factors on phenological change. The results showed that the SOS was advanced by an average of 0.26 d/yr, the EOS was delayed by an average of 0.12 d/yr, and the LOS was prolonged by an average of 0.38 d/yr during 2000-2019. The phenological characteristics of different vegetation types differed in their sensitivities to climatic factors, and the sensitivity of grassland to climatic factors was higher than those of other vegetation types. The preseason temperature and sunshine duration contributed more to SOS and EOS changes of forests than that of other vegetation types. Moreover, the SOS was more sensitive to preseason precipitation, and it was the main SOS determinant across grassland and meadows. The EOS was more sensitive to the daily minimum temperature. More importantly, climatic factors did not act independently on vegetation phenological changes. The interactions between preseason precipitation and temperature and between preseason sunshine duration and temperature had significantly affected the changes in the SOS and EOS, respectively. The results of this study highlight the response of different vegetation types to climate change in the arid mountainous areas, which is significant for improving the performance of phenology models.

TI  - A synergic study on estimating surface downward shortwave radiation from satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is a fundamental variable in determining the Earth's radiation balance and is essential in many applications. Considerable efforts have been devoted to algorithm development, product generation, and validation. However, few studies have focused on comparing retrieval approaches, examining their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying the most suitable scenarios for each approach. In this study, we implemented and evaluated five representative DSR retrieval algorithms, including the forward parameterization approach, two physical inversion methods (look-up table (LUT) and optimization), and two statistical inversion methods (direct estimation and neural networks). We then proposed an algorithm-integration framework that combined the results of these DSR retrieval methods to further improve DSR estimation accuracy and consistency. To validate the DSR retrievals, we used in-situ data collected at 25 stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) over one year. Validation revealed that forward parameterization consistently performed best, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 91.7 W/m(2) or a relative RMSE of 16.9%, although it generated the fewest valid retrievals. For an identical data set, the LUT approach generated results comparable to those of parameterization. The neural network-based algorithm-integration approach reduced the RMSE by 11.0 W/m(2) or the relative RMSE by 2.0%, compared to the best individual retrieval algorithm. Our analysis demonstrates that algorithm integration is a promising way to obtain DSR data that are superior to estimates from any individual retrieval algorithm.

TI  - The 30 m annual land cover dataset and its dynamics in China from 1990 to 2019
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) determines the energy exchange, water and carbon cycle between Earth's spheres. Accurate LC information is a fundamental parameter for the environment and climate studies. Considering that the LC in China has been altered dramatically with the economic development in the past few decades, sequential and fine-scale LC monitoring is in urgent need. However, currently, fine-resolution annual LC dataset produced by the observational images is generally unavailable for China due to the lack of sufficient training samples and computational capabilities. To deal with this issue, we produced the first Landsat-derived annual China land cover dataset (CLCD) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which contains 30m annual LC and its dynamics in China from 1990 to 2019. We first collected the training samples by combining stable samples extracted from China's land-use/cover datasets (CLUDs) and visually interpreted samples from satellite time-series data, Google Earth and Google Maps. Using 335 709 Landsat images on the GEE, several temporal metrics were constructed and fed to the random forest classifier to obtain classification results. We then proposed a post-processing method incorporating spatial-temporal filtering and logical reasoning to further improve the spatial-temporal consistency of CLCD. Finally, the overall accuracy of CLCD reached 79.31% based on 5463 visually interpreted samples. A further assessment based on 5131 third-party test samples showed that the overall accuracy of CLCD outperforms that of MCD12Q1, ESACCI_LC, FROM_GLC and GlobeLand30. Besides, we intercompared the CLCD with several Landsat-derived thematic products, which exhibited good consistencies with the Global Forest Change, the Global Surface Water, and three impervious surface products. Based on the CLCD, the trends and patterns of China's LC changes during 1985 and 2019 were revealed, such as expansion of impervious surface (+148.71 %) and water (+18.39 %), decrease in cropland (-4.85 %) and grassland (-3.29 %), and increase in forest (+4.34 %). In general, CLCD reflected the rapid urbanization and a series of ecological projects (e.g. Gain for Green) in China and revealed the anthropogenic implications on LC under the condition of climate change, signifying its potential application in the global change research.

TI  - Exploratory analysis of lateral pelvic sentinel lymph node status for optimal management of laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection in advanced lower rectal cancer without suspected lateral lymph node metastasis
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Total mesorectal excision (TME) and lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) without radiotherapy (RT) are standard treatment for lower cT3/4 rectal cancers in Eastern countries. In comparative studies, both TME + LLND and RT + TME yield good local control. Although Japanese guidelines recommend LLND for locally advanced rectal cancers below the peritoneal reflection, LLND dissection of clinically negative lateral pelvic lymph nodes (LPLN) is controversial, and laparoscopic TME + LLND is technically challenging and time-consuming. New optical instruments for laparoscopy allow easy perioperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification using ICG. The SLN concept may facilitate accurate diagnosis of LPLN involvement, and thus reduce LLND in laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. Here we investigated lateral pelvic SLN navigation surgery for SLN detection during laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. Methods This study included 21 patients with clinical StageII/III lower rectal cancer without LPLN enlargement, who underwent curative laparoscopic surgery. All patients underwent TME, followed by lateral SLN identification and biopsy using ICG, and then laparoscopic LLND. ICG fluorescence imaging was conducted using the laparoscopic near-infrared camera system. Results Lateral SLNs were successfully identified in 16 (76.2%) of the 21 patients. Among the 15 patients without SLN tumor metastasis, the dissected lateral non-SLNs were all negative. Conclusions A lack of metastasis in the lateral pelvic SLN seems to reflect a lack of metastases to all lateral LNs. Our present results suggest that this laparoscopic ICG-guided SLN strategy may be a low-risk and time-saving method to prevent laparoscopic LLND in cases with negative lateral pelvic lymph nodes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne hyperspectral images are expected to have abundant applications in various fields, particularly in the quantitative observation of the Earth. However, the problem of low spatial resolution has limited their effectiveness to some extent. There are urgent needs for high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images. We explore fusing the hyperspectral image with panchromatic and multispectral images captured by sensors onboard ZY-1 (02D) to obtain high-spatial-resolution and high-spectral-resolution images. Four approaches to obtain the final high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image data are proposed, and six fusion methods are used. The fusion results were evaluated using quantitative indicators and classification performance, and image quality greatly improved after fusion. The fusion approach that used multispectral image data as an intermediate layer twice in the fusion process obtained the best fusion effect, and this was verified by both quantitative and application evaluation results. This provides an effective approach to obtain a high-quality, high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image using the combination of panchromatic, multispectral, and hyperspectral images acquired by the sensors onboard ZY-1(02D).

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of aerosol optical depths over six major cities in Bangladesh
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a crucial parameter for assessing aerosol content and determining the level of air pollution. In this study, we represent almost seven years' aerosol optical behavioral patterns of six major cities in Bangladesh with emphasis on trends, seasonal variations, sources characterization, comparison between ground (AERONET) and satellite (MODIS Terra and Aqua) measurements, and relation with particulate matter (PM). High AOD values (>0.70) were obtained in most of the western parts of the country in all seasons. Decreasing patterns were observed from northwest to southeast. Average values of AOD for Dhaka, Chattagram, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barishal, and Sylhet were 0.71 +/- 0.08, 0.50 +/- 0.08, 0.78 +/- 0.06, 0.72 +/- 0.14, 0.64 +/- 0.08, 0.60 +/- 0.07 (Terra), and 0.59 +/- 0.07, 0.48 +/- 0.05, 0.69 +/- 0.08, 0.64 +/- 0.12, 0.56 +/- 0.05, 0.56 +/- 0.07 (Aqua), respectively. AERONET AODs at 870, 500, and 340 nm, and Angstrom Exponent (AE(440-870)) values for Dhaka city were 0.40, 0.78, 1.06, and 1.18, respectively. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Correlation coefficient (r) values were 0.23, 0.30, 0.64 (Terra) and 0.12, 0.29, 0.76 (Aqua), respectively. Both PM2.5 and PM10 were well correlated with all AODs but weakly correlated with AE. AODs, AE, and PM were negatively associated with meteorological variables such as rainfall, relative humidity, wind speed, and temperature. Anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols were dominated in all four seasons, but dust and mixed type aerosols were only dominated in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. This research would help researchers further know the nature of atmospheric aerosols and how they affect seasonal patterns.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of MODIS-derived near-surface air temperature using wide elevation-spanned measurements in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first comprehensive evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived near-surface air temperature, which has been used widely in a series of large-scale models varying in various disciplines ranging from climatology, hydrology to ecology. Four retrieval methods: the highest available pressure in the atmospheric profile product, interpolation by the adiabatic lapse rate, interpolation by the hypsometric equation and the combination with land surface temperature, were developed in the past, but only with validation in regional scale. All of these are evaluated in this paper against 2168 hourly meteorological recordings with an elevation span of over 5000 m in China. Results show that the method of the highest available pressure exhibits a serious underestimation, especially in areas of high elevation, such as the Tibetan Plateau. Interpolation by the hypsometric equation can only fix the underestimation to a very small extent, while interpolation by the adiabatic lapse rate can achieve a relatively good performance. In addition to the elevation influence, substantially variable estimates occur with the parabola-like distribution in low elevation areas, which implies the influ-ence of cloud in Southern China. The combination of the underestimation from interpolation by the adiabatic lapse rate and overestimation in land surface temperature can eliminate the disturbance of both elevation and cloud, resulting in the best performance with r = 0.94, bias = -0.83 degrees C and root-mean-square-error = 4.18 degrees C.

TI  - Sentinel-2 images for effective mapping of soil salinity in agricultural fields
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity is a critical feature for the management of agricultural soil, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. The present study was conducted to develop an effective soil salinity prediction model using Sentinel-2A (S2) satellite data. Initially, the collected soil samples were analysed for soil salinity (ECe). Subsequently, multiple linear regression analysis was carried out between the obtained ECe values and S2 data, for the prediction of soil salinity models. The relationship between ECe and S2 data, including individual bands, band ratios and spectral indices showed moderate to highly significant correlations (R-2 = 0.43-0.83). A combination of SWIR-1 band and the simplified brightness index was found to be the most appropriate (R-2 = 0.65; P < 0.001) for prediction of soil salinity. The results of this study demonstrate the ability to obtain reliable estimates of EC using S2 data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of land surface temperature in north-western Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aggravating deforestation, industrialization, and urbanization are becoming the principal causes for environmental challenges worldwide. As a result, satellite-based remote sensing helps to explore the environmental challenges spatially and temporally. This investigation analyzed the spatiotemporal variability in land surface temperature (LST) and its link with elevation in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data (2001-2020) were used. The pixel-based linear regression model was used to explore the spatiotemporal variability of LST changes. Furthermore, Sen's slope and Mann-Kendall trend test were used to determine the magnitude of temporal shifts of the areal average LST and evaluate trends in areal average LST, respectively. Coefficient of variation (CV) was also used to analyze spatial and temporal variability in seasonal and annual LST. The seasonal LST CV varied from 1.096-10.72%, 0.7-11.06%, 1.29-14.76%, and 2.19-10.35% for average autumn (September to November), summer (June to August), spring (March to May), and winter (December to February) seasons, respectively. The highest inter-annual variability was observed in the eastern, northern, and south-western districts than that in the other parts. The seasonal spatial LST trend varied from -0.7-0.16, -0.4-0.224, 0.6-0.19, and -0.6-0.32 for average autumn, summer, spring, and winter seasons, respectively. Besides, the annual spatial LST slope varied from -0.58 to 0.17. Negative slopes were found in the central, mid-western, and mid-northern districts in annual LST, unlike the other parts. The annual variations of mean areal LST decreased insignificantly at the rate of 0.046 degrees C year(-1) (P<0.05). However, the inter-annual variability trend of annual LST increased significantly. Generally, the LST is tremendously variable in space and time and negatively correlated with elevation.

TI  - Spectral variations of the remote sensing reflectance during coccolithophore blooms in the Western Black Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the many calcifying marine organisms, coccolithophores are the major producer of particulate inorganic carbon (PIC). Calcium carbonate plates covering coccolithophores, called coccoliths and released during blooms, are responsible for a large increase of the water reflectance. Aiming at investigating the spectral features of the remote sensing reflectance R-RS(lambda) of marine waters during coccolithophore blooms, this study exploits the radiometric data of Ocean Color sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) in the Western Black Sea (Galata and Gloria/Section-7) by focusing on bloom events that occurred in 2017 and 2020. The analysis, besides showing elevated R-RS(lambda) in the blue-green spectral region in the presence of coccoliths, confirms a shift toward the blue of the R-RS(lambda) spectra as the bloom declines and coccoliths accumulate at the surface. Results also document a decreased capability of determining the bloom state in the presence of optically complex waters such as those associated with river runoff. Finally, the comparison of satellite versus AERONET-OC radiometric data for the extreme conditions created by the presence of coccolithophores, indicates agreements between R-RS(lambda) not significantly different from those previously determined for various satellite data products in the absence of appreciable concentrations of coccoliths.

TI  - Urban expansion quantification from remote sensing data for sustainable land-use planning in Mangaluru, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth is indispensable in developing countries, particularly in the context of rapid economic development and growing urban population. The idea of managing urban growth is often restricted exclusively to large metropolis; ignoring small and emerging cities from the requirement of having sustainable urban growth strategies. India, experiencing a rapid pace of urban growth is expected to host its future urban population in its small and medium-sized cities. In this context, the dynamics of urban growth in numerous small and mediumsized cities must be studied and urban policies must be reoriented to ensure sustainable urbanisation in future. However, the nonavailability of geospatial data for generating information database and models to support decision making processes on a local scale pose challenges in developing countries. The remote sensing technology offers cost-effective, timely, and efficient technology to collect urban spatial data, to generate urban physical and socioeconomic information using various GIS and statistical models. In this study, the spatial pattern, dynamics and goodness of urban growth in Mangaluru city were studied in the context of its implications for future sustainable development using the techniques of remote sensing, GIS and statistical models. The urban land is delineated from the Landsat series of satellites then, the statistical models were applied to study the trend of urban growth. The built-up land in Mangaluru has increased significantly by more than 400 % during 1972-2018. Further, subtleties of urban growth were studied by extracting land-use expansion modes, UEI Index, UED Index, Pearson's Chi-square and Shannon's entropy. Finally, the goodness of urban growth was measured to identify the sustainability of urban growth. The findings suggest that the urban expansion mode was dominated by leapfrogging and edge expansion at the peri-urban area during initial periods which eventually gave way to infilling and edge-expansion. Also, a rapid expansion in urban land was expected in the southern and southeastern part of the city. The study confirms the prevalence of the highly unsustainable nature of urban growth in the study area and therefore advocates participatory urban planning in managing and for achieving a sustainable urban growth.

TI  - Child maltreatment data: A summary of progress, prospects and challenges
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 1996, the ISPCAN Working Group on Child Maltreatment Data (ISPCAN-WGCMD) was established to provide an international forum in which individuals, who deal with child maltreatment data in their respective professional roles, can share concerns and solutions. Objective: This commentary describes some of the key features and the status of child maltreatment related data collection addressed by the ISPCAN-WGCMD. Methods: Different types of data collection methods including self-report, sentinel, and administrative data designs are described as well as how they address different needs for information to help understand child maltreatment and systems of prevention and intervention. Results: While still lacking in many parts of the world, access to child maltreatment data has become much more widespread, and in many places a very sophisticated undertaking. Conclusion: The ISPCAN-WGCMD has been an important forum for supporting the continued development and improvement in the global effort to understand and combat child maltreatment thus contributing to the long term goals of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Nevertheless, based on what has been learned, even greater efforts are required to improve data in order to effectively combat child maltreatment.

TI  - Slit homogenizer introduced performance gain analysis based on the Sentinel-5/UVNS spectrometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially heterogeneous Earth radiance scenes affect the atmospheric composition measurements of high-resolution Earth observation spectrometer missions. The scene heterogeneity creates a pseudo-random deformation of the instrument spectral response function (ISRF). The ISRF is the direct link between the forward radiative transfer model, used to retrieve the atmospheric state, and the spectra measured by the instrument. Hence, distortions of the ISRF owing to radiometric inhomogeneity of the imaged Earth scene will degrade the precision of the Level-2 retrievals. Therefore, the spectral requirements of an instrument are often parameterized in the knowledge of the ISRF over non-uniform scenes in terms of shape, centroid position of the spectral channel and the full width at half maximum (FWHM).The Sentinel-5/UVNS instrument is the first push-broom spectrometer that makes use of a concept referred to as a slit homogenizer (SH) for the mitigation of spatially nonuniform scenes. This is done by employing a spectrometer slit formed by two parallel mirrors scrambling the scene in the along track direction (ALT) and hence averaging the scene contrast only in the spectral direction. The flat mirrors do not affect imaging in the across track direction (ACT) and thus preserve the spatial information in that direction. The multiple reflections inside the SH act as coherent virtual light sources and the resulting interference pattern at the SH exit plane can be described by simulations using scalar diffraction theory. By homogenizing the slit illumination, the SH strongly modifies the spectrograph pupil illumination as a function of the input scene. In this work we investigate the impact and strength of the variations of the spectrograph pupil illumination for different scene cases and quantify the impact on the ISRF stability for different types of aberration present in the spectrograph optics.

TI  - A correlational study on size differentiated aerosols on monsoonal and pre-monsoonal cloud properties over the Indo Gangetic Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particle size is a critical parameter in deciding the cloud condensation nuclei activation efficiency and hence largely influential in the cloud formation and dynamics. Here we study the size differentiated influence of aerosol optical depth (AOD) on cloud properties for the densely polluted Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) for a period of 2000-2017 using satellite observations. Terra on board MISR derived AOD for two size ranges, small (aerodynamic radius 0.35 mu m) and large (aerodynamic radius 0.7 mu m) are correlated with MODIS derived cloud properties such as cloud fraction (CF), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud top pressure (CTP) and cloud effective radius - liquid (CER-Liq) for monsoon and pre monsoon period, over the study area. Our study reveals that the size differentiated aerosols interacts differently with the cloud properties sometimes even contrarily. Small aerosol particles have shown better correlation with cloud properties than coarser particle. Furthermore, estimation of aerosol indirect effect has shown that small particles favour the Twomey effect while large particles follow the anti Twomey effect over the IGB. The anti Twomey effect for large particles i.e., positive AOD-CER relationship could be due to the elevated absorbing aerosol over the region causing aerosol induced heating of the cloud. In order to understand the aerosol characteristics over the IGB region, AERONET datasets from four IGB stations have been analysed, which indicated the presence of increased amount of coarser mode particles and absorbing aerosols over the study region. Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) are often overshadowed by internal cloud dynamics and upper air meteorology. Cloud segregated analysis using ISCCP classification suggests that the dominant clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus influences the correlation statistics considerably. Partial correlation studies on four meteorological parameters (RH, vertical velocity, U and V component of wind) have revealed that ACI is also influenced by the upper air dynamics, particularly during monsoon.

TI  - Geoecological parameters indicate discrepancies between potential and actual forest area in the forest-steppe of Central Mongolia
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Forest distribution in the forest-steppe of Mongolia depends on relief, permafrost, and climate, and is highly sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Forest fires and logging decreased the forest area in the forest-steppe of Mongolia. The intention of this study was to identify the geoecological parameters that control forest distribution and living-tree biomass in this semi-arid environment. Based on these parameters, we aimed to delineate the area that forest might potentially occupy and to analyse the spatial patterns of actual and potential tree biomass. Methods We used a combination of various geographic methods in conjunction with statistical analyses to identify the key parameters controlling forest distribution. In several field campaigns, we mapped tree biomass and ecological parameters in a study area within the Tarvagatai Nuruu National Park (central Mongolia). Forest areas, topographic parameters and vegetation indices were obtained from remote sensing data. Significant correlations between forest distribution and living-tree biomass on one hand, and topographic parameters, climate data, and environmental conditions on the other hand, were used to delineate the area of potential forest distribution and to estimate total living-tree biomass for this area. Results Presence of forest on slopes was controlled by the factors elevation, aspect, slope, mean annual precipitation, and mean growing-season temperature. Combining these factors allowed for estimation of potential forest area but was less suitable for tree-biomass delineation. No significant differences in mean living-tree biomass existed between sites exposed to different local conditions with respect to forest fire, exploitation, and soil properties. Tree biomass was reduced at forest edges (defined as 30 m wide belt), in small fragmented and in large forest stands. Tree biomass in the study area was 20 x 10(9) g (1,086 km(2) forest area), whereas the potential tree biomass would reach up to 65 x 10(9) g (> 3168 km(2)). Conclusions The obtained projection suggests that the potential forest area and tree biomass under the present climatic and geoecological conditions is three times that of the present forest area and biomass. Forest fires, which mostly affected large forest stands in the upper mountains, destroyed 43% of the forest area and 45% of the living-tree biomass in the study area over the period 1986-2017.

TI  - A rule-based semi-automatic method to map burned areas in Mediterranean using Landsat images - revisited and improved
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - At local or regional scales, where Landsat has been extensively applied to monitor burned areas, semi- or fully automated methods are not very common. Koutsias et al. ([2013]. "A Rule-Based Semi-Automatic Method to map Burned Areas: Exploring the USGS Historical Landsat Archives to Reconstruct Recent Fire History." International Journal of Remote Sensing 34 (20): 7049-7068) developed a semi-automatic method to map burned areas consisted of a set of rules that are valid especially when the post-fire image has been captured shortly after the fire. However, the rule-based approach is not free of errors that eventually create limitations to adopt this method for reconstructing the fire history in a fully automated mode. In this work, we improved the method by revisited and improving the rules that have been developed in the first paper, especially for reducing the omission errors. Minor changes have been made to almost all rules; however, one of the rules has been revised and changed the most as compared to the others by also considering the short-wave infrared channel TM5 (in Landsat-5 or Landsat-7). In this case, the algorithm could successfully capture the fire scar in dry vegetated areas as well. Due to the lack of reference data collected in the field, we used reference data collected by photo interpretation, and the accuracy assessment showed that these had a high agreement with the burned land mapping results.

TI  - Effect of Anti-COVID-19 Measures on Atmospheric Pollutants Correlated with the Economies of Medium-sized Cities in 10 Urban Areas of Grand Est Region, France
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Sentinel-5P data, this study investigated the magnitude of change in the concentration of air pollutants (NO2, HCHO, SO2, O-3, CO, and aerosol index) in the air of ten cities and urban areas of the French region of Grand Est as a result of the first lockdown imposed between March 17, 2020 and May 11, 2020. The results showed that the air quality in the urban environments of Grand Est improved significantly compared to the same period in 2019 without lockdown. NO2, O-3, aerosol index and CO were the pollutants that exhibited maximum reductions by an average of -33.98%, -5.94%, -26.82% and -0.66%, respectively (the observed maximum decreases were -54.7%, -7.7%, -13.1%, and -5.3%, respectively). The largest decrease occurred in the Public Establishments of Inter-municipal Cooperation (EPCI, in French: Etablissement public de cooperation intercommunale) areas of Eurometropole de Strasbourg, CA Colmar, and CA Mulhouse Alsace. The maximum decrease in air pollution first occurred in land cover classes close to cities, followed by built-up urban areas. In this study, a global depollution index known as the atmospheric clearance index (ACI) was developed, which involved several air pollution parameters, and quantitatively analyzed the decrease in contamination levels of the atmosphere in this region. In addition, the correlation between the novel ACI and other population and economic development indices was studied. The results indicated that there was a negative and statistically significant correlation between ACI and population density, gross domestic product, gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, number of employees, and active enterprises.

TI  - Multiband directional reflectance properties of oil-in-water emulsion: application for identification of oil spill types
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflection characteristics play a critical role in identifying, assessing, and responding to different types of oil spills. In this paper, we prepared three concentrations of oil-in-water (OW) emulsions and measured their directional reflection properties in the visible and near-IR range. The spectral differences in reflectance between OW emulsions and oil films were analyzed. Furthermore, the AVIRIS and Landsat 7 images collected over the oil spill accident in the Gulf of Mexico were used to demonstrate the feasibility to apply the experimental results in the identification of oil spill types. The results show that OW emulsions and oil films can be well discriminated in remote sensing images based on their reflectance spectral differences. The OW emulsion is mainly distributed in strips along the edge of the oil film, which is useful to delineate the spill outline and calculate the polluted area. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI  - Fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over metropolitan areas from space: A multi-model analysis of OCO-2 data over Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas, where more than 55% of the global population gathers, contribute more than 70% of anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2ff) emissions. Accurate quantification of CO2ff emissions from urban areas is of great importance for formulating global warming mitigation policies to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Satellite-based inversion techniques are unique among "top-down" approaches, potentially allowing us to track CO2ff emission changes over cities globally. However, their accuracy is still limited by incomplete background information, cloud blockages, aerosol contamination, and uncertainties in models and priori emission inventories. To evaluate the current potential of space-based quantification techniques, we present the first attempt to monitor long-term changes in CO(2ff )emissions based on the OCO-2 satellite measurements of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (X-CO2) over a fast-growing Asian metropolitan area: Lahore, Pakistan. We first examined the OCO-2 data availability at global scale. About 17% of OCO-2soundings over the global 70 most populated cities from 2014 to 2019 are marked as high-quality. Cloud blockage and aerosol contamination are the two main causes of data loss. As an attempt to recover additional soundings, we evaluated the effectiveness of OCO-2 quality flags at the city level by comparing three flux quantification methods (WRF-Chem, X-STILT, and the flux cross-sectional integration method). The satellite/bottom-up emissions (OCO-2/ODIAC) ratios of the high-quality tracks with reduced uncertainties in emissions are better agreed across the three methods compared to the all-data tracks. This demonstrates that OCO-2 quality flags are useful filters of low-quality OCO-2 retrievals at local scales. All three methods consistently suggested that the ratio medians are greater than 1, implying that the ODIAC slightly underestimated CO2ff emissions over Lahore. Additionally, our estimation of the a posteriori CO2ff emission trend was about 734 kt C/year (i.e., an annual 6.7% increase). 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Mann-Kendall upward trend test showed that less than 10% prior uncertainty for 8 tracks (or less than 20% prior uncertainty for 25 tracks) is required to achieve a greater-than-50% trend significant possibility at a 95% confidence level. It implies that the trend is driven by the prior and not due to the assimilation of OCO-2 retrievals. The key to improving the role of satellite data in CO2 emission trend detection lies in collecting more frequent high-quality tracks near metropolitan areas to achieve significant constraints from X-CO2 retrievals.

Results: From January 2015 to December 2019, the overall positive rate of Chlamydia pneumoniae among patients with acute respiratory infection in Beijing was 0.34% (129/37 460). The positive rate of Chlamydia pneumoniae generally increased in March, reaching the peak in May, and started to drop in July, with a duration of about 5-8 months. The epidemic season in different years fluctuated by 1-2 months. The positive monthly rate of Chlamydia pneumoniae was no less than 0.30% in every epidemic season. The positive rate of Chlamydia pneumoniae was the highest in the 5-44 years old group and the highest in 10-14 year-olds. The risk of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection increased with age in patients younger than 25 years old and decreased in those older one aged than 25 years of age. The positive rates in male and female patients were 0.33% (68/20 830) and 0.37% (61/16 528), respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi2=0.486, P=0.486). The positive rate of Chlamydia pneumoniae in patients with common pneumonia was higher than that in patients with upper pneumonia and severe pneumonia (chi2=36.797, P<0.01). Other respiratory pathogens were also detected in the Chlamydia pneumoniae samples, and the top four pathogens appeared as Haemophilus influenzae (15 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 cases), Rhinovirus (8 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (7 cases). 101 strains of 129 Chlamydia pneumoniae positive samples were identified as type A by sequencing. Conclusions: The annual epidemic pattern of Chlamydia pneumoniae in Beijing, is unimodal, and the epidemic season generally appears from March to July. The seasonal characteristics of Chlamydia pneumoniae in Beijing can be used for the differential diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae from other respiratory pathogens. Chlamydia pneumoniae is most common in people aged 5-44 years, and the primary genotype is type A. People aged 10-44 years old suffer the highest incidence. If the nucleic acid positive rate of Chlamydia pneumoniae exceeds 0.30% for two consecutive months, the high prevalence period of Chlamydia pneumoniae can be preliminarily expected. Chlamydia pneumoniae infection has a higher probability of progressing to severe pneumonia from general pneumonia.

TI  - Integrating remotely sensed fuel variables into wildfire danger assessment for China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - As regulated by the 'fire environment triangle', three major forces are essential for understanding wildfire danger: (1) topography, (2) weather and (3) fuel. Within this concept, this study aimed to assess the wildfire danger for China based on a set of topography, weather and fuel variables. Among these variables, two remotely sensed key fuel variables, fuel moisture content (FMC) and foliage fuel load (FFL), were integrated into the assessment. These fuel variables were retrieved using radiative transfer models from the MODIS reflectance products. The random forest model identified the relationships between these variables and historical wildfires and then produced a daily updated and moderate-high spatial resolution (500 m) dataset of wildfire danger for China from 2001 to 2020. Results showed that this dataset performed well in assessing wildfire danger for China in terms of the 'Area Under the Curve' value, the fire density within each wildfire danger level, and the visualisation of spatial patterns. Further analysis showed that when the FMC and FFL were excluded from the assessment, the accuracy decreased, revealing the reasonability of the remotely sensed FMC and FFL in the assessment.

TI  - Multi-sensor fusion using random forests for daily fractional snow cover at 30 m
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to providing water for nearly 2 billion people, snow drives resource selection by wildlife and influences the behavior and demography of many species. Because snow cover is highly spatially and temporally variable, mapping its extent using currently available satellite data remains a challenge. At present, there are no sensors acquiring daily data of Earth's entire surface at fine spatial resolutions (< 30 m) in wavelengths required for snow cover retrieval, namely: visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared. Fine scale observations at 30 m from Landsat are available at 16-day intervals since 1982 and at 8-day intervals since 1999. However, over this duration, snow can accumulate, ablate, or both, making the Landsat data ineffective for many applications. Conversely, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospherically corrected daily reflectance data, have a coarse spatial resolution of 463 m and thus, are not ideal for snow cover mapping either. This spatial and temporal resolution tradeoff limits the use of these data for a wide range of snow cover applications and indicates a pressing need for data fusion. To address this need, we use a physically-based, spectralmixture-analysis approach for mapping fractional snow cover (fSCA) and a two-stage random forest algorithm to produce daily 30 m fSCA. We test our algorithm in the US Sierra Nevada and find MODIS fSCA is the most important predictor. We cross validate using 170 Landsat scenes and while snow cover varies immensely in time we find little variation in errors between seasons, a small bias of 0.01, and an overall accuracy of 0.97 with slightly higher precision than recall. This technique for accurate, daily, high-resolution snow cover retrievals could be applied more broadly for analyses of regional energy budget, validating snow cover in global and regional models, and for quantifying changes in the availability of biotic resources in ecosystems.

TI  - Linking river sediment arsenic to catchment spatial attributes in agricultural landscapes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of the sources and processes involved in the heavy metal accumulation in river sediments is important for measuring the risks associated with human exposure. Hence, an integrated modeling approach was designed to study the linkage between landscape-related natural and anthropogenic features and high arsenic levels at the outlet of six catchments on the Ghareh-Ajagh River, central Iran. Sediment arsenic levels were measured in 8 months from October 2018 to November 2019 when the river sediment and water conditions were stable and ranged from 16.3 to 78.5 mg/kg. Monthly catchment-level agricultural areas were extracted from Landsat 8-OLI images. Predictive variables included NDVI values; area and spatial patterns of agriculture measured using four landscape metrics of NP, PD, MPS, and ENN; length and slope of the streams extended from main agricultural areas to the catchment outlet; and four hydrologic soil groups. The best-fitted multiple regression model (r(2) = 0.763, p <= 0.05) with the Akaike information criteria of 105.07 was developed using stream length, soil group C, and area and PD of agricultural areas. Results showed that sediment arsenic levels increase with increasing quantity and density of agricultural activities that were close to the river outlet and increasing proportion of silty loam or loamy soils but are relatively less dependent on agricultural structural patterns. These insights are helpful to inform policy decisions regarding the processes involved in river contamination in central Iran.

TI  - Update of the German S3 guideline "Diagnosis and treatment of oral cavity cancer": what's new?
T2  - MKG-CHIRURG
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Since its establishment in 2012, the clinical S3 guideline "Diagnosis and treatment of oral cavity cancer" has provided practical management guidance with the objective of achieving the best possible prognosis and quality of life for each individual constellation of findings. In order to account for the continual increase in knowledge, the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF) stipulates that the guideline be updated after 5 years. The aim of this update is to check the evidence for and benefit of the current recommendations, to evaluate recent changes in clinical practice with the highest possible evidence, and to incorporate evidence-based advances by adding corresponding recommendations. In November 2017, the guideline committee lead by the German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Mund-, Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie, DGMKG) and with funding from the German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO) reconvened to launch the update. Methods A systematic literature search was performed regarding all the key questions prioritized by the guideline committee. Relevant studies were identified by title, abstract, and full-text screening, critically evaluated, and summarized in evidence tables. For the update process, a systematic literature search was performed on the following topics: the role of sentinel lymph nodes; extended neck dissection (ND) in the case of level IIb or III infiltration; a possible wait-and-see strategy for cT1/2 maxillary carcinoma; a neoadjuvant treatment concept in cT3/4; and the question of adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy in a pT1/2pN1 situation. Furthermore, questions regarding the indication for PET/CT, the use of CAD/CAM technology during bone reconstruction, and the differential indication for panendoscopy and immunotherapy were addressed in working groups. All statements and recommendations of the existing version were checked for amendment requirements; amended and new statements and recommendations were checked and voted on in formal consensus (nominal group technique, consensus conference). Results A total of 88 statements or recommendations were checked and confirmed, 21 were modified or newly incorporated. The indication for ND in invasive oral cavity cancer remains, despite new imaging and sentinel node biopsy studies; only in very superficial cT1cN0 maxillary carcinomas can this be replaced by intensified follow-up. In case of negative FDG-PET findings after primary radio(chemo)therapy, salvage ND can also be omitted. Differential indication between modified radical and supraomohyoid ND in cN1 disease remains unjustified by available studies. The indication for adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy for pN1 findings is optional. Use of checkpoint inhibitors is recommended instead of the previously favorized EXTREME regimen as first-line treatment in selected patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. The interfaces between oromaxillofacial surgery, otorhinolaryngology, radiotherapy, and oncology were confirmed. The new TNM system and classification of tumor stages were incorporated. For prospective assessment of the rate of R1 situations after resection with curative intent, a new quality indicator was introduced. Due to the consistent complete implementation already achieved, the quality indicator recording pretherapeutic ENT presentation could be omitted.Conclusion Via a structured update process independently sponsored by the German Cancer Society, the existing guideline was not only completely updated, but also further developed regarding issues of multimodal therapy in particular. However, owing to lacking or insufficient data, numerous questions could be answered on the basis of expert consensus alone. Consistent performance of prospective treatment trials is thus essential for the future development of the guideline. Interdisciplinary planning and treatment under consideration of the individual patient's constellation and wishes is decisive for therapeutic success.

TI  - Decadal increase in the ecological status of a North-Atlantic intertidal seagrass meadow observed with multi-mission satellite time-series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are monitored in the frame of several environmental programs worldwide, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD), to evaluate the ecological status of European coastal and transitional water bodies. The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using validated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4-6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of information for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD.

TI  - Robotic Radical Trachelectomy with Primary Vaginal Closure to Spare Fertility in Young Patients with Early-Stage Cervical Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Our aim was to present the surgical technique of robotic radical trachelectomy (RRT) for early-stage squamous cell cervical cancer in women with a desire to preserve fertility.Design. A surgical case to illustrate the entire surgical technique of RRT and sentinel lymph node dissection. Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this video presentation.Setting. University hospital.Interventions. A 30-year-old patient with one child and no medical history. Pap smear and cervical biopsy were in favor of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and a conization procedure allowed the diagnosis of a 15 mm squamous cell carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] 1B1). An RRT was performed to preserve the fertility of this young patient, after bilateral sentinel lymph node dissection to ensure the absence of nodal metastasis. The trachelectomy specimen was negative at final pathology examination and the disease was confirmed as stage 1B1 (FIGO 2018). There were no surgical complications and no adjuvant treatment was indicated. Fertility-sparing surgery is acceptable for women of childbearing age who want to become pregnant.Conclusion. Minimally invasive surgery is safe, effective, and particularly adapted for women who wish to preserve their fertility without compromising oncological outcomes.1(-)2 This option may be safely proposed in expert centers for tumors smaller than 2 cm, with primary vaginal closure, and without use of a uterine manipulator.3 Complete information about oncological and obstetrical outcomes is mandatory and patients should agree to comply with a close follow-up protocol.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - LULC mapping is essential for any satellite data to visualize the land information. This study aims to focus on the performance evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms for LULC mapping of satellite datasets. Optical (Sentinel-2), Microwave (Sentinel-1), and fused datasets have been generated using Ehlers, Brovey and Principal Component fusion. For each dataset, two ML Algorithms i.e. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied. Results suggested that the optical and fused dataset achieved the more promising results than the microwave dataset as it contains only the backscatter information. Moreover, fusion of micro-wave with optical achieved more realistic LULC classification results. The overall accuracy derived for optical, microwave, and fused data are 92 %, 93.43 %, 37.71 %, 37.14 %, 85.71 % and 89.14 % using RF and SVM classifiers, respectively.

TI  - Impact of environmental attributes on the uncertainty in MAIAC/MODIS AOD retrievals: A comparative analysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work examines the impact of different environmental attributes on the uncertainty in satellite-based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval against the benchmark Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD measurements at 21 sites across North Africa, California and Germany, in the years 2007-2017. As a first step, we studied the effects of spatial averaging the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD retrievals, and of temporal averaging the AERONET AOD around the satellite (Aqua) overpass, on the agreement between the two products. AERONET AOD averaging over a time-window of +/- 15 min around the satellite overpass and the 1 x 1 km(2) spatial grid of MAIAC were found to provide the best AOD retrieval performance. Next, MAIAC AOD were stratified according to different co-measured environmental attributes (aerosol loading, dominant particle size, vegetation cover, and prevailing particle type) and analyzed against the AERONET AOD. The envelope of the expected retrieval error varied considerably among different environmental attributes categories, with more accurate AOD retrievals obtained over highly vegetated areas (i.e. less surface reflectance) than over arid areas. Moreover, the retrieval accuracy was found to be sensitive to the aerosol loading and particle size, with a large bias between the MAIAC and AERONET AOD during high aerosol loading of coarse particles. In addition, the retrieval accuracy of MAIAC AOD was found to depend on the aerosol type due to the aerosol model assumptions regarding their optical properties.

TI  - High-accuracy source-independent radiometric calibration with low complexity for infrared photonic sensors
T2  - LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration (RC) is an essential solution to guarantee measurements from infrared photonic sensors with certain accuracy, the main task of which is to determine the radiometric responsivity of sensor and usually be solved by comparing with some radiation source (i.e., blackbody), called source-based RC (SBRC). In addition to the complexity in manufacture, the nonideal characteristics of an available source will inevitably introduce unexpected uncertainties to reduce the final calibration accuracy by around 0.2-0.5 K in SBRC. Therefore, we propose an original source-independent RC (SIRC) principle based on modeling instead of comparing for SBRC, where the incident background radiation to detector, as a dominated factor influencing the responsivity characteristics of a photonic sensor, is modeled to implement RC for both two fundamental types (photoconductive and photovoltaic) of HgCdTe photonic detectors. The SIRC merely requires the temperature information of main components of a sensor other than some complex source and its assembly, and provides a traceable way at lower uncertainty costs relative to the traditional SBRC. The SIRC is being implemented in Fengyun-2 satellites since 2019, which ensures a long-term stable service of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellites for the global observation system under the framework of World Meteorological Organization. Moreover, a 20-year-period traceable Fengyun-2 dataset to be recalibrated with SIRC will benefit the further climate applications.

TI  - Urban morphology detection and it's linking with land surface temperature: A case study for Tehran Metropolis, Iran
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of urban areas and alteration of natural land cover exacerbate the local climate change. To find out the effect of land cover changes on the local climate, in this study, the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) concept was utilized to detect urban morphology in Tehran Metropolis. LCZ and Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be identified and classified based on available remote sensing products. Firstly, LCZ maps of Tehran metropolis were extracted using Landsat imagery, and secondly, relationships between LCZ and LST were explored for three years (1990, 2004, and 2018). We found that Tehran urban structure has 13 LCZs based on imagery from Landsat 5 and 14 LCZs based on images for Landsat 7 and 8. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were estimated at 62% and 0.60, respectively. Results show that built-up classes including compact high-rise, compact mid-rise, and heavy industrial areas tended to increase the surface temperature, while except for bare land, all other land cover types tended to decrease the surface temperature. The findings also suggest that complementary optical and thermal remote sensing data, such as the combination of OLI with TIRS imageries, were sufficient for supervised LCZ and LST classification in a semi-arid region of Tehran metropolis.

TI  - Characterizing the Context and Demand for the US Forest Service's Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program in 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The US Forest Service's Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) was a major policy innovation for supporting collaborative, landscape-scale forest restoration. Twenty-three CFLRP projects were funded following requests for proposals in fiscal years (FY) 2010 and 2011. Congress appropriated the fully authorized amount of $40 million to the program in FY 2012. In 2018, Congress reauthorized the CFLRP, and soon thereafter the Forest Service issued a request for new CFLRP proposals. In this article, we provide background on the reauthorization of the CFLRP and the updated proposal process. We present findings from a document analysis of the final 22 CFLRP proposals submitted in FY 2020 to characterize current demand for CFLRP and the nature of the proposed projects. We discuss our findings in the context of the CFLRP Advisory Committee's recommendations, funding uncertainty, and broader efforts to support cross-boundary, collaborative wildfire mitigation and forest restoration.Study Implications: Reviewing the broader context of the CFLRP and the FY 2020 proposals highlights the importance of the program in pursuing collaborative, cross-boundary wildfire mitigation and restoration across the US.There is high demand for the program, as illustrated by more than $600 million requested over 10 years and more than $400 million in planned partner contributions for projects across diverse ecosystems involving locally driven partnerships. Ensuring consistent funding and leadership commitment, aligning policies across scales, supporting collaboration, encouraging innovation to support restoration and local economies, and using adaptive monitoring approaches are needed to facilitate the success of programs like CFLRP.

TI  - Research on the dissipation of green tide and its influencing factors in the Yellow Sea based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, the outbreak of green tides has become the most serious ecological problem in the Yellow Sea. In this study, a new method was used to identify green tides in multi-source satellite data from 2007 to 2020, and the relationship between the conditions necessary for green tide dissipation and other environmental factors was discussed. We found a "wavy" trend of green tide scales over the 14-year dissipation period. The dissipation direction was influenced by sea surface wind (SSW) and sea surface circulation (SSC). Under the action of northeast moving SSW and SSC, green tides move away from the shore and drift northward; under the action of northwest or southwest moving SSW and SSC, they moved towards the shore and drift southward. The date of dissipation was influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation, and high SST accelerated the process of green tide dissipation, while precipitation slowed it down.

TI  - Performance of VMS and nightly satellite in monitoring light fishing vessels in the open South China Sea
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of satellite technology, vessel monitoring has entered a new era. In this study, through a comparison with better-recorded fishing logs, we analyzed the performance of vessel monitoring system (VMS) and nightly satellite data in monitoring fishing activities of a large-sized falling net vessel mainly targeting the purpleback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) in the open South China Sea. Logbook data indicate that the studied vessel operated fishing for 57 days in the 3-month fishing season, performing a total number of 474 fishing hauls with -233.7 tons of catches. Our analysis indicated that with VMS data only, fishing state can hardly be distinguished from the drifting one, while even under the influence of clouds, the nightly satellite can identify most (98 %) of the fishing operations that were emitting bright lights. In addition, catch rates recorded by fishing logs significantly correlated with the numbers of lighted lamps when the nightly satellite passed over, which implies that the radiance may even be used as a proxy for catch. Although the radiance emitting from lighted lamps onboard a fishing vessel and detected by a nightly satellite is influenced by a number of factors, such as cloud conditions and satellite viewing zenith angle, jointly use of VMS and nightly satellite data can be an effective approach in monitoring and managing this type of light fishing vessels.

TI  - Islam and the cognitive study of colonialism: The case of religious and educational reform at Egypt's al-Azhar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that the emerging Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) provides a valuable new perspective on colonialism. CSR argues that humans are innately inclined towards certain types of religious belief (e.g., belief in spirit beings, belief in immortal souls) and certain types of non-utilitarian morality (e.g., belief in an obligation to care for kin, belief in an obligation to avoid 'disgusting' substances or behaviours). These innate inclinations underlie many religious and cultural traditions transformed by colonialism, including Islam. The article suggests that colonial power operates not only by suppressing traditional non-Western institutions but also by suppressing the natural inclinations underlying non-Western traditions. This claim is developed through a study of colonial efforts to transform Egypt's al-Azhar, the world's most influential institution of Islamic learning and scholarship. These efforts made al-Azhar into the centre of a global Islamic reform movement, which sought to integrate Islam with a colonial scientific-utilitarian worldview.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil classes using spatial extrapolation with imbalanced data
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital mapping of soil classes using the extrapolation approach is timesaving, economically cheap, and helps collecting soil data from areas with difficult sampling. However, it has not been explored widely enough for digital mapping of soil classes. This study seeks to evaluate and compare several machine learning and regression algorithms for the extrapolation of soil sub-groups. Also the issue of imbalanced number of observations was addressed and oversampling technique was applied on the minority soil class to improve the models performance. The study area is located in central north Iran with 84 and 72 soil profiles sampled in the donor and recipient areas, respectively. A set of various environmental covariates including remotely sensed data, digital elevation model derivatives and geomorphology map were used as explanatory variables for predicting soil classes. Results showed that among eleven investigated models, C5.0 decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and multinomial logistic regression (MNL) had the highest overall accuracy of 46%, 42% and 38%, respectively, for the extrapolation of soil classes. Also the Kappa statistic values for these models were 0.30, 0.24 and 0.22, respectively. Oversampling of the minority soil class led to an increase in overall accuracy for some of the models with the highest ones being DT = 53% and RF = 50%. Also, the Kappa value for DT and RF models increased to 0.39 and 0.35, respectively. In addition, oversampling of the minority soil class led to the prevention of losing this class in the final map.

TI  - Intensive care bed requirements for COVID-19 in the fall/winter of 2021 Simulation of different scenarios under consideration of incidences and vaccination rates
T2  - MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite the increasing vaccination rates against SARS-CoV-2, there is a risk of a renewed wave of infections in autumn 2021 due to the high seasonality of the pathogen, with the associated renewed possible heavy burden on intensive care. In the following manuscript we simulated different scenarios using defined mathematical models to estimate the burden of intensive care treatment by COVID-19 patients within certain limits during the coming autumn. Methods The simulation of the scenarios uses a stationary model supplemented by the effect of vaccinations. The age group-specific risk profile for intensive care unit (ICU)-associated disease progression is calculated using third wave ICU admission data from sentinel hospitals, local DIVI registry occupancy data and the corresponding local incidence rates by linear regression with time lag. We simulated vaccination rates of 15% for the over 18-year-old cohort, 70% for the 15-34 year cohort, 75%/80%/85% for the 35-59 year cohort and 85%/90%/95% for the over 60-year-old cohort. The simulations take into account that vaccination provides 100% protection against disease progression requiring intensive care. Regarding protection against infection in vaccinated persons the simulations are depicted for the scenario of 70% protection against infection in vaccinated persons and for the scenario of 85% protection against infection in vaccinated persons. Results The incidence is proportional to ICU bed occupancy. The proportionality factor is higher than in the second and third waves, so that comparable ICU bed occupancy is only achieved at a higher incidence. A 10% increase in vaccination rates of the over 35-year-olds to 85% and of the over 60-year-olds to 95% leads to a significant reduction in ICU bed occupancy. Discussion There will continue to be a close and linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 incidence and ICU bed occupancy in the coming months. Even above incidences of 200/100,000 a considerable burden of ICUs with more than 3000 COVID-19 patients can be expected again, unless the vaccination rate is significantly increased. A few percentage points in the vaccination rate have a significant impact on potential ICU occupancy in the autumn, so efforts to increase vaccination acceptance should be a priority in the coming weeks. For intensive care medicine, the vaccination rate of those over 35 years of age is crucial.

AB  - Background Single-sided deafness presents communication challenges for adults. There are a range of care options, including CROS hearing aids, available but little is known about patient preferences for these interventions. Objective The objective of this study was to understand the viewpoints of patients making decisions about audiological interventions they use. Methods A constructivist worldview using thematic analysis to undertake a constant comparative analysis of 8 semi-structured interviews. Sampling Participants were recruited from Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust audiology service in England. Findings The results of the study describe ongoing iterative judgements being made by participants, informed by their access to information, effectiveness of audiological interventions, stigma, barriers to accessing care, and constant cost-benefit analyses being made. The key factors involved in decision-making by individuals with Single-sided deafness (SSD) are discussed. Conclusions This study represents the first in-depth exploration of the individual's lifeworld related to which factors influence use of different audiological interventions by individuals with SSD. It highlights the complex and ongoing nature of how decisions are made by these individuals and identifies the need for greater information provision by clinicians, such as through use of a decision aid tool.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of satellite data in areas such as weather tracking and modeling, ecosystem monitoring, wildfire detection, and land-cover change are heavily dependent on the tradeoffs to spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of observations. In weather tracking, high-frequency temporal observations are critical and used to improve forecasts, study severe events, and extract atmospheric motion, among others. However, while the current generation of geostationary (GEO) satellites has hemispheric coverage at 10-15-min intervals, higher temporal frequency observations are ideal for studying mesoscale severe weather events. In this work, we present a novel application of deep learning-based optical flow to temporal upsampling of GEO satellite imagery. We apply this technique to 16 bands of the GOES-R/Advanced Baseline Imager mesoscale dataset to temporally enhance full-disk hemispheric snapshots of different spatial resolutions from 10 to 1 min. Experiments show the effectiveness of task-specific optical flow and multiscale blocks for interpolating high-frequency severe weather events relative to bilinear and global optical flow baselines. Finally, we demonstrate strong performance in capturing variability during convective precipitation events.

TI  - Maximum lake surface water temperatures changing characteristics under climate change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) plays an important role in the metabolism of aquatic organisms, and is also an important indicator in lake ecosystems which affects the ecology and biogeochemical processes of lakes. The current research mainly focuses on the long-term trends of LSWT and the impact of climate warming on LSWT. Researchers have not paid enough attention to the study of extreme changes in trend of LSWT. An ice-free lake in China called Dianchi Lake was selected as our research area. We carried out a quantitative analysis of and provided a discussion on the changes in the maximum lake surface water temperature (MLSWT) from 2001 to 2018 at two timescales (month and year) based on MODIS 11A2 composite product data and water temperature environment of cyanobacteria outbreaks. The results showed that the MLSWT of Dianchi Lake increased between 2001 and 2018 and continued to exceed the temperature threshold (17.6 degrees C) for cyanobacterial outbreaks during some timeframes and that the duration of high temperatures also increased. This phenomenon will extend the suitable growth period of cyanobacteria and will have a complex and long-term impact on water quality, the lake ecological environment, and the growth of aquatic organisms.

TI  - Spatial water footprint optimization of crop planting: A fuzzy multiobjective optimal approach based on MOD16 evapotranspiration products
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time. To improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production, this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting. This study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information, and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets, spatial water footprint, and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty. To test its feasibility, the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi-arid region in Northwest China. Three performance evaluation indicators, including synthetic degree (SD), sustainability index (SI), and approximation degree of ideal objective value (AD), are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies. Results show that (1) the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation, and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial; (2) the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream with high precipitation, which can improve economic benefit, increase utilization rate of green water, and fairness of allocation; (3) through optimization, the average total, blue, and gray water footprint among IDs are drop while green water utilization rates is raised comparing with status quo (2014); (4) Water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy, society and environment, but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives. The proposed optimal modeling framework can help optimize the spatial water footprint of crop planting and improve irrigation water use efficiency, which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity.

TI  - Impact of landscape dams on river water cycle in urban and peri-urban areas in the Shiyang River Basin: Evidence obtained from hydrogen and oxygen isotopes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the needs of human recreation and provide community amenities, landscape dams (i.e., water retaining structures for intercepting river water in cities and surrounding areas, which are mainly used to create an urban landscape environment) are built in urban and pen-urban areas worldwide. The construction of these dams, however, may adversely affect the local and regional water cycle. We collected water samples from 2015 to 2019 from different water bodies in urban and pen-urban areas traversing the middle and upper reaches of Shiyang River Basin in the arid area of Central Asia to analyze their isotopic characteristics. Meanwhile, field surveys as well as meteorological, hydrological, and remote-sensing data were added to evaluate the hydrologic effects of urban landscape dams on a watershed scale in an arid region with scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems. Isotopic values of landscape water were more enriched than that of natural river. The result of the evaporation loss ratio showed that the landscape water was 0-5% higher. Moreover, the cumulative effect of multiple landscape dams leads to a great loss of water resources in arid areas. The study also demonstrated that evaporation is a vital factor in causing change in the isotope composition of the landscape water in the Shiyang River Basin. The interaction between surface water and groundwater was frequent within the landscape dam area wherein groundwater was mainly recharged by surface water leakage. Sufficient attention should be given to the evaporation, leakage, local precipitation, and groundwater changes caused by the impoundment of landscape dams. Thus, the potentially adverse effects of urban landscape dams in arid regions should be highly considered in long-term water-resources sustainability planning.

TI  - Climate-driven abrupt changes in plant communities of desert and semi-desert region
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Abrupt changes are referred to as fundamental changes in the mean of a system's variable or its variability which occur in a short term. Abrupt changes in climatic factors may, especially in arid lands, lead to the transition of plant communities as their response to such disturbing elements. However, such a relationship (between factor and response) which helps develop more sustainable policies for ecosystem management has so far been underresearched. This study, therefore, set out to identify the abrupt changes occurred in plant communities and their relationship with the sudden variations of climatic factors in Sirjan desert and semi-desert region, located in Kerman, Iran, from 2000 to 2019. To this end, first, the meteorological data were collected from the region's representative station (Sirjan synoptic Station) and the plant communities' maps were extracted based on field operations. Then, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer's (MODIS) monthly data from 2000 to 2019 were used to extract Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) whose maps were limited to the community's maps under zonal statistic survey, using Arc-GIS 10.4.1 package. Finally, the sequential Mann-Kendall (SMK) test was administered to identify the abrupt changes in climatic factors and those of each plant communities. The abrupt changes in yearly total precipitation (YTP) in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2018 occurred concurrently with the responses made by plant communities including the Artemisia sieberi-Zygophyllum atriplicoides, Ephedra intermedia-Cousinia multilobe. In this regard, the cumulative effect of the abrupt change of the winter precipitation (WP) factor in 2002 and 2014 and the abrupt increase of the average yearly temperature (YAT) factor in 2018 was highly effective in the intensification of the stimulating role of total yearly precipitation (YTP) in making the plant communities respond as a result. Despite the concurrent responses observed in the vast majority of plant communities, the reason behind some of their responses in 2006, 2011, 2013, and 2016 remained unknown, requiring more investigations in terms of other environmental variables.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we examined the subsidence occurring over two main plains for agricultural activities in Qom province in Iran using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). ENVISAT-ASAR images from 2003 to 2010 and Sentinel-1A images from 2014 to 2019 were used to produce interferograms and mean velocity maps of subsidence in the line of sight (LOS) direction. Using the analyses in geospatial information science (GIS), the spatial correlations between areas with subsidence and water level drop and agricultural land-uses were explored. The results showed the mean velocity map which revealed 35 and 28 mm/yr of deformation going away in the LOS direction in Jafarabad and Qanvat plains, respectively, between 2003 and 2010 and higher subsidence rates between 2014 and 2019. Moreover, maximum subsidence occurred in the places that had not only a larger water level decline, but also a greater thickness of fine-grained sediments. Finally, the environmental effect of subsidence on the ground, infrastructures and water salinity was examined.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem water use efficiency over the Chinese Loess Plateau base on long-time satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE), defined as the ratio between carbon gains and water loss from the system, has been recognized as an important characteristic of carbon and water balances. The long-lasting "Grain for Green" Program (GFGP) initiated in 1999 in China's Loess Plateau (CLP) is a large-scale ecological program in the world, which aims to improve the CLP's ecosystem resilience by enhancing vegetation cover and productivity. Understanding how the GFGP can affect eWUE is imperative to ensuring sustainable water resources and to promoting sustainable management strategies. In this study, we evaluated the spatiotemporal variability of growing-season eWUE and examined its response to both climate change and vegetation coverage from 1982 to 2017. Our results indicate that growing-season eWUE, gross primary productivity (GPP), and evapotranspiration (ET) in CLP area increased significantly from 1982 to 2017. Specifically, eWUE, GPP, and ET increased more rapidly after China established the program. The most significant growth area of eWUE was found in main areas conducting GFGP project, including the Loess hilly and gully area (LHGA). Spatially, eWUE, GPP, and ET in the growing season increased from northwest to southeast, and higher eWUE was found in areas with high vegetation cover. The spatial and temporal variability of eWUE was related to vegetation cover (expressed as leaf area index, LAI) and climatic variability. Significant positive correlations were observed between growing-season LAI, temperature, and eWUE, because the LAI and temperature have a greater effect on photosynthesis than ET. Our results suggested that the GFGP was the main driving force that causes the spatial-temporal variability of eWUE in CLP.

TI  - Assessment of water quality in a tropical ramsar wetland of southern India in the wake of COVID-19
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus influenced the world severely in the first half of 2020 caused shut down of all kind of human activities. It is reported that a word-wide ecological improvement in terms of air quality and water quality during this lock down period. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the progression in water quality through examining suspended particulate matter using remote sensing data in a tropical Ramsar site viz, Asthamudi Lake in Southern India. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the study area were analyzed and suspended particulate matter (SPM) is estimated from Landsat 8 OLI images. A comparison analysis of pre and co lockdown periods reveal that the concentration of SPM values during lockdown (mean SPM 8.01 mg/l) is lower than that of pre-lockdown (10.03 mg/l). The time series analysis of last five-year data from 2015 to 2020 also shows an average decrease of 43% in SPM concentration during lockdown period compared to the last five-year average value of 9.1 mg/l. The reasons for improvement of SPM in water quality during the lockdown period in April-May 2020 was discussed, in terms of the role of anthropogenic activities and strategies for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources in the Asthamudi Lake were also presented.

TI  - Time space analysis of dams in the State of Par acute accent a in the last 20 years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of the reservoir sites of water bodies is of utmost importance for the study and management of water resources. However, the registration of such information in a continental country like Brazil is still done in a merely informative way by the owners of these reservoirs. The on-site registration by the inspection and environmental agencies such as the National Water Agency (ANA) demands a high cost, besides taking a long time to be carried out, generating delays, outdated registration, or lack of information, which can bring consequences in the efficient management of water resources in the municipalities. The present work has as its main objective to carry out the mapping of the dams in the entire state of Par ' a, which have an area of water sheet greater than 3,600 m(2). A temporal analysis of their construction over the last 20 years (1999-2019) was carried out using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images with the MNDWI index method; to compare the records generated with the official records, as well as to study the factor influencing the appearance of these new dams. The results obtained showed a significant increase of 656 % in new dams or reservoirs in the last 20 years. A total of 3704 dams were identified in the State of Par'a; however, only 314 dams are registered on ANA's website, representing a rate of only 9 %. Also, it was noted that the exponential increase in this number occurred in mesoregions where agribusiness activities are practiced, such as cattle and soybean farming. Thus, the results can serve as support to the inspection agencies in identifying the most critical sites that need to be inspected.

TI  - Long time-series NDVI reconstruction in cloud-prone regions via spatio-temporal tensor completion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The applications of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data are inevitably hampered by cloud-induced gaps and noise. Although numerous reconstruction methods have been developed, they have not effectively addressed the issues associated with large gaps in the time series over cloudy and rainy regions, due to the insufficient utilization of the spatial, temporal and periodical correlations. In this paper, an adaptive SpatioTemporal Tensor Completion method (termed ST-Tensor) method is proposed to reconstruct long-term NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions, by making full use of the multi-dimensional spatio-temporal information simultaneously. For this purpose, a highly-correlated tensor is built by considering the correlations among the spatial neighbors, inter-annual variations, and periodic characteristics, in order to reconstruct the missing information via an adaptive-weighted low-rank tensor completion model. An iterative l1 trend filtering method is then implemented to eliminate the residual temporal noise. This new method was tested using MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products from 2001 to 2018 obtained in Mainland Southeast Asia, where the rainy climate commonly induces large gaps and noise in the data. The qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the ST Tensor method is more effective than the five previous methods in addressing the different missing data problems, especially the temporally continuous gaps and spatio-temporally continuous gaps. It is also shown that the ST-Tensor method performs better than the other methods in tracking NDVI seasonal trajectories, and is therefore a superior option for generating high-quality long-term NDVI time series for cloud-prone regions.

TI  - Five-Year Breast Surgeon Experience in LYMPHA at Time of ALND for Treatment of Clinical T1-4N1-3M0 Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a source of postoperative morbidity for breast cancer survivors. Lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach (LYMPHA) is a technique used to prevent BCRL at the time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We report the 5-year experience of a breast surgeon trained in LYMPHA and investigate the outcomes of patients who underwent LYMPHA following ALND for treatment of cT1-4N1-3M0 breast cancer. Methods A retrospective review of patients with cT1-4N1-3M0 breast cancer was performed in patients who underwent ALND with and without LYMPHA. Diagnosis of BCRL was made by certified lymphedema therapists. Descriptive statistics and lymphedema surveillance data were analyzed using results of Fisher's exact or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Logistic regression and propensity matching were performed to assess the reduction of BCRL occurrence following LYMPHA. Results In a 5-year period, 132 patients met inclusion criteria with 76 patients undergoing LYMPHA at the time of ALND and 56 patients undergoing ALND alone. Patients who underwent LYMPHA at the time of ALND were significantly less likely to develop BCRL than those who underwent ALND alone (p = 0.045). Risk factors associated with BCRL development were increased patient age (p = 0.007), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003), and, in patients undergoing LYMPHA, number of positive nodes (p = 0.026). Conclusions LYMPHA may be successfully employed by breast surgeons trained in lymphatic-venous anastomosis at the time of ALND. While research efforts should continue to focus on prevention and surveillance of BCRL, LYMPHA remains an option to reduce BCRL and improve patient quality of life.

TI  - Breast cancer-related lymphoedema: Risk factors and prediction model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: To identify the risk factors for lymphoedema following axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in a European sample and to propose a lymphoedema prediction model for this population.Design: Predictive retrospective cohort study comparing women who developed lymphoedema in 2 years of undergoing ALND with those who did not developed lymphoedema.Methods: We reviewed the clinical records of 504 women who, between January 2008 and May 2018, underwent surgery for breast cancer that involved ALND. Logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors for lymphoedema. The prediction accuracy of the model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results: Of the 504 women whose records were analysed, 156 developed lymphoedema. Significant predictors identified in the regression model were level of lymph node dissection, lymph node status, post-operative complications, body mass index (BMI) and number of lymph nodes extracted. The prediction model showed good sensitivity (80%) in the study population.Conclusions: The factor contributing most to the risk of lymphoedema was the level of lymph node dissection, and the only patient-related factor in the prediction model was BMI. The model offers good predictive capacity in this population and it is a simple tool that breast care units could use to assess the risk of lymphoedema following ALND. Nurses with specialist knowledge of lymphoedema have a key role to play in ensuring that women receive holistic and individualized care.Impact: What problem did the study address? Secondary lymphoedema is one of the main complications in the treatment of breast cancer. What were the main findings? The prediction model included five factors associated with the risk of lymphoedema following ALND. The strongest predictor was the level of lymph node dissection, and the only patient-related factor was BMI. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? The prediction model offers breast care units a tool for assessing the risk of lymphoedema in women undergoing surgery involving ALND. The results highlight the importance of weight reduction as a preventive measure and support a more conservative surgical approach.

TI  - A photoacoustic finder fully integrated with a solid-state dye laser and transparent ultrasound transducer
T2  - PHOTOACOUSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard-of-care for evaluating lymph node status in breast cancers and melanoma metastasis is sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment performed with a handheld gamma probe and radioisotopes. However, this method inevitably exposes patients and physicians to radiation, and the special facilities required limit its accessibility. Here, we demonstrate a non-ionizing, cost-effective, handheld photoacoustic finder (PAF) fully integrated with a solid-state dye laser and transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT). The solid-state dye laser handpiece is coaxially aligned with the spherically focused TUT. The integrated finder readily detected photo acoustic signals from a tube filled with methylene blue (MB) beneath a 22 mm thick layer of chicken tissue. In live animals, we also photoacoustically detected both SLNs injected with MB and subcutaneously injected melanomas. We believe that our radiation-free and inexpensive PAF can play a vital role in SLN assessment.

TI  - Can Sentinel-2 be used to detect invasive alien trees and shrubs in Savanna and Grassland Biomes?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of alien plant invasions on ecosystems translates into major economic losses for nations across the globe. Freely available satellite imagery can be used to provide relevant data for effective management of alien plant invasions, especially for developing nations with limited budgets. However, detecting alien herbaceous and shrubby vegetation using freely available imagery has not been widely tested. The aim of this study was to detect invasive alien plants in the Savanna and Grassland Biomes of the uMngeni Catchment. The novelty of this study is the focus on not only alien trees, but also alien shrubs, which tend to be more sparsely spread and are harder to detect. Using the free Google Earth Engine Platform for repeatability, we explore the efficacy of data fusion of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and landform data, various feature selection techniques and two powerful non-parametric classifiers. We found that feature selection techniques result in lower classification accuracies and are therefore not recommended for similar applications. Data fusion, such as combining Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and landform data, did not improve classification results. Support Vector Machine shows superiority over the Random Forest classifier. The final classifications indicate, with 80-90 % accuracy, that for 2019 about 17.5 % (736.15-763.75 km(2)) of the uMngeni Catchment was occupied by invasive alien trees and shrubs (e.g., gums, wattles, pines and Bugweed), either in the form of plantations or invasions. This translates to between 88.3 million and 173 million m(3) of water per year in evapotranspiration losses, or 23 % or the current system yield. At a spatial resolution of 20 x 20 m, these outputs are useful for regional or local planning and prioritization. Furthermore, the repeatable approach of this study is a significant advance compared to past efforts that have produced publicly available datasets for the region, and could be employed by other data-scarce developing nations.

TI  - Monitoring thermal environment deterioration and its dynamic response to urban expansion in Wuhan, China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how urban heat island (UHI) effect responds to urbanization is of great significance to develop appropriate UHI mitigation measures. However, the dynamic response of thermal environment to urban expansion is still less discussed. In this study, the spatiotemporal variation of thermal characteristics and its dynamic response to urbanization was monitored at the pixel level in 1987, 1996, 2007 and 2016 in Wuhan, China based on multi-temporal remotely sensed images. The results indicate that Wuhan experienced significant thermal deterioration during the 29-year period, which was largely attributed to the rapid urbanization from 1996 to 2007. Due to the high spatial heterogeneity of urban development, the thermal characteristic variation did not always spatially correspond to urbanization process. The urbanization dynamics alone can explain only 14.84% similar to 36.37% of the spatiotemporal variation in thermal environment throughout the study area. Nevertheless, the thermally deteriorated areas had good spatial consistence with the rapidly developed areas in all cases, suggesting that urban development could better explain the dynamic characteristics of thermal environment in more rapidly urbanized areas (with the R-2 values of 0.7013-0.9989). An obvious "context effect" was detected during the dynamic influence of urban development on thermal environment variation. Urban development based on the increase of construction density only strengthened UHI intensity, but contributed little to the spread of thermal environment deterioration. Urban expansion with amounts of newly expanded construction land should be responsible for thermal environment deterioration. These findings provide detailed information and sound evidence to adjust urban planning options accordingly to improve thermal environment.

TI  - Decadal changes in size, salinity, waterbirds, and fish in lakes of the Konya Closed Basin, Turkey, associated with climate change and increasing water abstraction for agriculture
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Konya Closed Basin (KCB) in Turkey has a cold semiarid to warm Mediterranean climate and hosts the largest Turkish freshwater lake, Lake Beysehir, and the iconic saline Lake Tuz. Using published as well as our own ground-truth and remote sensing data, we provide (1) a brief description of the paleoenvironmental changes in the KCB; followed by (2) a detailed description of the changes in land use, crop farming, groundwater and surface water levels, and climate; and (3) associated changes in lake water surface area and salinity as well as in waterbird and fish communities during the past 40 years. The KCB is intensively farmed, and the farming of mainly water intensive crops has increased substantially, especially since 2000. This, combined with climate warming, has led to a substantial rate of reduction of the groundwater level (up to 1 m/yr) and the surface area of the lakes and wetlands, followed by an increase in salinisation, and even complete loss of several wetlands. Three globally threatened waterbird species face extinction in the basin, and 18 of the 62 previous breeding species have already been lost. The KCB has 38 fish species, of which 74% are endemic and 61% are considered threatened or near threatened. Modelling projections using various climate and land use scenarios predict serious additional reductions of the water level in the future due to climate change, leading to deterioration (or complete loss) of lake ecosystems and the services they provide.

TI  - Mapping and quantifying agricultural irrigation in heterogeneous landscapes using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial analysis using remote sensing data has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. Humid and heterogeneous landscapes such as those in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain are challenging for satellite image classification over large spatial extents. The objectives of this study are to: 1) compile relevant vegetation indices for mapping and quantifying irrigated and dryland agricultural areas across the coastal plain region of South Carolina, USA; 2) identify the spatial and temporal change of the agricultural irrigation areas in the region over time; 3) compare the results to county-level statistics reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the study area. In this study, a framework has been developed to regularly monitor irrigated agriculture's extent and distribution using high-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery for the coastal plain of South Carolina region using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The maps were produced using random forest supervised classification for three years with overall accuracy assessments of 83.73% (2016), 86.18% (2017), and 84.55% (2018). The major irrigated crops in the study area are corn, cotton, soybeans, and peanuts. Overall, the irrigated crops' distribution areas were mainly concentrated in counties near the center of the studied region. The produced maps will provide valuable information for the development of irrigated agriculture and the optimization of irrigation water use in the region. The methodology followed in this study can be applied to any other regions around the world with similar landscapes and climatic conditions.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmentally persistent, ubiquitous pollutants. It is important to continuously monitor the presence of PFAS contamination, utilizing both legacy and new sentinels. In this study, environmental PFAS levels were evaluated using ticks as a sentinel model due to their world-wide distribution, hematophagous nature, and ease of collection and sampling. Hematophagy in discrete blood meals, from a suite of vertebrates, allows ticks to sample dozens of species of consumers and bioaccumulation across communities. Four different species of ticks, across two states (NY, n = 28 in mid-April of 2020 and FL, n = 32 between 2015 and 2020) with two sampling sites in each state were analyzed for the presence of 53 PFAS. The total PFAS concentration in ticks was the lowest at Newburgh (NY), a site that has been undergoing remediation efforts, while the highest total PFAS concentrations were measured in ticks at the Sweetwater site, a wastewater treatment wetland. Detection of PFAS and the potential for variation between tick species and between locations are necessary to establish the utility of ticks as sentinels, in addition to assessing additional environmental factors, such as other wildlife, water, or soil.

TI  - Prediction of diffuse radiation in solar energy applications: Turkey case study and compare with satellite data
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In solar engineering applications, the components of the solar radiation a location must be known to design the systems. Due to the difficulties in the diffuse solar radiation (DSR) measurements, as this component has not been measured in everyplace, the DSR models have been established for various locations over the world. In this study, the models developed to constitute a relation between the monthly mean daily diffuse fraction and diffuse coefficient with clearness index and sunshine fraction in the open literature for Turkey are reviewed. In addition, the comparisons of the DSR values taken from the NASA Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (NASA-SSE) and computed from the best models for example two cities are carried out. The performances of the models are investigated by various statistical test techniques. These statistical test techniques are root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The statistical comparisons show that the best models give well agreement with the DSR values taken from the NASA-SSE. The difference between the yearly total DSR calculated from the best models and NASA-SSE is approximately 1.94% for Erzurum and 0.57% for Gebze. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Surveillance of Sentinel Node-Positive Melanoma Patients Who Receive Adjuvant Therapy Without Undergoing Completion Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Adjuvant therapy trials required completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma prior to systemic treatment, but nodal surveillance without CLND is now common. For patients receiving adjuvant therapy without CLND, patterns of recurrence are unknown and the value of regional nodal ultrasound alongside cross-sectional imaging is not well-defined. Methods In a retrospective cohort of SLN-positive melanoma patients managed with nodal surveillance from June 2014 to June 2019, we evaluated the association between adjuvant treatment and location of first recurrence (locoregional, nodal, distant, or multisite) using Chi-square tests. We compared methods of recurrence detection and cost by surveillance intensity using Chi-square and Dunn's tests. Results Among 177 nodal surveillance patients, 66 (37%) received adjuvant therapy. Median follow-up was 24 months, during which 48 patients (27%) recurred. Adjuvant treatment did not alter patterns of initial recurrence (p = 0.76). Adjuvant therapy recipients more often had both nodal ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging surveillance (p < 0.01). Among 13 isolated nodal recurrences, 85% were within the first year and 85% were detected by examination and/or ultrasound. Increasing surveillance intensity was not associated with recurrence detection rates but increased overall cost and cost per detected recurrence. Conclusion Regardless of adjuvant treatment, most nodal recurrences occurred in the first year and were initially detected clinically or by ultrasound. Findings support continued use of examination and nodal basin ultrasound in addition to any planned cross-sectional imaging surveillance.

TI  - Approaching precision public health by automated syndromic surveillance in communities
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel physician surveillance in communities has played an important role in detecting early signs of epidemics. The traditional approach is to let the primary care physician voluntarily and actively report diseases to the health department on a weekly basis. However, this is labor-intensive work, and the spatio-temporal resolution of the surveillance data is not precise at all. In this study, we built up a clinic-based enhanced sentinel surveillance system named "Sentinel plus" which was designed for sentinel clinics and community hospitals to monitor 23 kinds of syndromic groups in Taipei City, Taiwan. The definitions of those syndromic groups were based on ICD-10 diagnoses from physicians. Methods Daily ICD-10 counts of two syndromic groups including ILI and EV-like syndromes in Taipei City were extracted from Sentinel plus. A negative binomial regression model was used to couple with lag structure functions to examine the short-term association between ICD counts and meteorological variables. After fitting the negative binomial regression model, residuals were further rescaled to Pearson residuals. We then monitored these daily standardized Pearson residuals for any aberrations from July 2018 to October 2019. Results The results showed that daily average temperature was significantly negatively associated with numbers of ILI syndromes. The ozone and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly positively associated with ILI syndromes. In addition, daily minimum temperature, and the ozone and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly negatively associated with the EV-like syndromes. The aberrational signals detected from clinics for ILI and EV-like syndromes were earlier than the epidemic period based on outpatient surveillance defined by the Taiwan CDC. Conclusions This system not only provides warning signals to the local health department for managing the risks but also reminds medical practitioners to be vigilant toward susceptible patients. The near real-time surveillance can help decision makers evaluate their policy on a timely basis.

TI  - Evaluation of wetland ecosystem health using geospatial technology: evidence from the lower Gangetic flood plain in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The floodplain wetland habitat in the lower Gangetic plains of West Bengal played a significant role in protecting from environmental degradation like pollution, lowering groundwater table, natural hazards, and others as well as supports for human wellbeing. Thus, it is needed to investigate the health status of wetlands and suggest restoration strategies to protect the livelihood patterns dependent on wetlands. This paper presents the health of the wetland ecosystem by comprising the wetland ecosystem health index (WHI) in 2011 and 2018 at the block level of Malda district, as a part of the lower Gangetic flood plain using the pressure-state-response model (PSR model) and AHP method. A total number of six Landsat satellite images and statistical census data were used to determine the wetland health. Wetlands are classified as very healthy (2.81-3.33), healthy (2.41-2.80), sub-healthy (2.01-2.40), unhealthy (1.61-2.00), and sick (0-1.60) category on the basis of the wetland ecosystem health index score. The results of this study showed that the wetlands located surrounding English Bazar, Manikchak, Ratua-II, and Kaliachak-II blocks have a sub-healthy to very healthy condition in 2011 but changed to unhealthy to sick category in 2018 due to the increase of rapid urbanization, population density, and development activities. These areas have belonged to the sub-healthy to sick category in the year 2011 as well as 2018 due to high wetland pressure. Our observation reveals that the ecosystem service value provided by wetlands decreased by 62.51% and 20.46 in the observed period. Management of WEH should emphasize on large (>100 ha) and medium (51-100 ha) sizes of wetlands in the Diara region of West Bengal. Developing local-level institutions and setting restoration goals are useful strategies to manage wetland resources, and protecting biodiversity should be guided by the Government organization and NGOs.

TI  - Improving the efficiency of the BG sentinel 2 trap to assess the activity of Aedes (<i>Stegomyia</i>) aegypti [Linnaeus, 1762] in Senegal
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of efficient mosquito sampling methods in vector surveillance programs is crucial to inform control actions and prevent outbreaks. amongst existing trapping methods, the BG sentinel trap is widely used for collecting mosquitoes from the subgenus Stegomyia. However, studies state that the BG-sentinel trap underestimates the relative abundance of mosquito vectors. In this study, we used mice to enhance the effectiveness of the BGsentinel trap to collect Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and follow the species' daily abundance under local conditions. The Latin square method was used to compare different combinations in three different seasons. Of the 35,107 mosquitoes collected, Ae. aegypti (53.82%) and Culex quinquefasciatus (46.07%) were dominant. The combination of BG-Lure + 3 mice captured more Ae. aegypti individuals (apparent density per trap/day (ADT = 187.65 +/- 133.53; p < 0.001) followed by the 3 mice-baited BG-sentinel trap (ADT = 163.47 +/- 117.32), the BG-sentinel trap without attractant (ADT = 74.15 +/- 117.07) and the BG-sentinel trap + BG-Lure (ADT = 47.1 +/- 115.91). Aedes aegypti showed two peaks of activity in the day, one following the sunrise and one before the sunset, influenced by temperature and relative humidity. Our study suggests the use of mice to enhance the efficiency of the BG-Sentinel trap to catch Ae. aegypti. However, its application in large scale entomological monitoring programs should be difficult because of ethical and operational constraints.

TI  - Analyzing glacier retreat and mass balances using aerial and UAV photogrammetry in the Otztal Alps, Austria
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use high-resolution aerial photogrammetry to investigate glacier retreat in great spatial and temporal detail in the Otztal Alps, a heavily glacierized area in Austria. Long-term in situ glaciological observations are available for this region as well as a multitemporal time series of digital aerial images with a spatial resolution of 0.2m acquired over a period of 9 years. Digital surface models (DSMs) are generated for the years 2009, 2015, and 2018. Using these, glacier retreat, extent, and surface elevation changes of all 23 glaciers in the region, including the Vernagtferner, are analyzed. Due to different acquisition dates of the large-scale photogrammetric surveys and the glaciological data, a correction is successfully applied using a designated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey across a major part of the Vernagtferner. The correction allows a comparison of the mass balances from geodetic and glaciological techniques - both quantitatively and spatially. The results show a clear increase in glacier mass loss for all glaciers in the region, including the Vernagtferner, over the last decade. Local deviations and processes, such as the influence of debris cover, crevasses, and ice dynamics on the mass balance of the Vernagtferner, are quantified. Since those local processes are not captured with the glaciological method, they underline the benefits of complementary geodetic surveying. The availability of high-resolution multi-temporal digital aerial imagery for most of the glaciers in the Alps provides opportunities for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of climate-change-induced glacier retreat and mass loss.

TI  - Tumor extracellular vesicles drive metastasis (it's a long way from home)
T2  - FASEB BIOADVANCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Among a plethora of functions, extracellular vesicles released by primary tumors spread in the organism and reach distant organs where they can induce the formation of a premetastatic niche. This constitutes a favorable microenvironment for circulating tumor cells which facilitates their seeding and colonization. In this review, we describe the journey of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the primary tumor to the future metastatic organ, with a focus on the mechanisms used by EVs to target organs with a specific tropism (i.e., organotropism). We then highlight important tumor EV cargos in the context of premetastatic niche formation and summarize their known effects on extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, vessel permeabilization, resident cell activation, recruitment of foreign cells, and ultimately the formation of a pro-inflammatory and immuno-tolerant microenvironment. Finally, we discuss current experimental limitations and remaining opened questions in light of metastatic diagnosis and potential therapies targeting PMN formation.

AB  - The increase of toxic concentration leads environmental pollution. Soil pollution has become the most important problem of current scenario due to the rapid growth of industries. The pollution level can be measured based on the concentration of heavy metals in soil. This work focus on the level of heavy metal concentration in Soil because of water pollution in Tirupur District, Tamilnadu, India, known for dying activities. The heavy metal concentrations have been investigated using soil samples and remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI images) with the relevant soil standards. Spectral mixture modelling approach and regression analysis are applied to the field and remote sensing data to map heavy metal contamination in soil. Finally, the element concentration of remote sensing data was correlated with in-situ data and results are analyzed.

TI  - Gradient Guided Pyramidal Convolution Residual Network with Interactive Connections for Pan-sharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have played a predominant role in the field of remote sensing over the last few years. As a significant branch of remote sensing image processing, pan-sharpening technique is to produce a high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) image based on a low-resolution multi-spectral (LRMS) image and a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image. Benefiting from the inherently powerful representation ability, deep-learning-based methods have also achieved promising and favourable performance in pan-sharpening community. However, these methods don't take advantage of the gradient characteristic which contains abundant structure information to guide the pan-sharpening process, failing to achieve the desired spatial preservation. In this paper, we propose a gradient-guided pyramidal convolution residual network with interactive connections (GGPCRN) to relieve the above issue. Specifically, besides the indispensable reconstruction branch, an auxiliary gradient branch providing additional structure information is built to guide the recovery process. Moreover, we introduce pyramidal convolution containing a series of filters with varying depth and size into our network to capture different scales of details for better performance. To further enhance the guidance of gradient maps, two measures are taken. On the one hand, interactive connections are proposed to transfer the mutual effect between the reconstruction branch and gradient branch. On the other hand, we incorporate a mild gradient loss to force a second-order restraint on the pan-sharpened images, making the network concentrate more on structure preservation. Both reduced-resolution and full-resolution experiments suggest that our GGPCRN performs favourably against other methods in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual improvements.

TI  - Anomaly Detection and Classification in Multispectral Time Series Based on Hidden Markov Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agriculture from satellite remote sensing data, such as multispectral images, has become a powerful tool since it has demonstrated a great potential for providing timely and accurate knowledge of crops. Detecting anomalies in time series of multispectral remote sensing images for crop monitoring is generally performed using a large sample of historical data at a pixel level. Conversely, this article presents a framework for anomaly detection (AD), localization, and classification that exploits the temporal information contained in a given season at a parcel level to detect and localize outliers using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Specifically, the AD part is based on the learning of HMM parameters associated with unlabeled normal data that are used in a second step to detect abnormal crop parcels referred to as anomalies. The learned HMM can also be used in time segments to temporally localize the anomalies affecting the crop parcels. The detected and localized anomalies are finally classified using a supervised classifier, e.g., based on support vector machines. The proposed framework is applicable to images partially covered by clouds and can handle a set of crop parcels acquired in the same season bypassing problems due to crop rotations. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic and real data, where the real data correspond to vegetation indices extracted from several multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of rapeseed crops. The proposed approach is compared to standard AD methods yielding better detection rates with the advantage of allowing anomalies to be localized and characterized.

TI  - Characteristics of dust aerosols and identification of dust sources in Xinjiang, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in atmospheric particulate matter content directly affect the Earth-atmosphere system balance and climate change and indirectly affect the environment and ecology. Therefore, this matter is receiving increasing attention. A typical arid area with a fragile ecological environment and frequent dust activities, Xinjiang, China, was investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily aerosol optical thickness and angstrom ngstro center dot m wavelength exponent data to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of longterm dust aerosols over 20 years. The frequency of occurrence was calculated to accurately identify anthropogenic and natural sources, and data, such as wind speed, were superimposed to quantitatively estimate dust aerosol emissions. The factors that influenced dust aerosol emissions are discussed. The results show that the distribution of dust aerosols in South and North Xinjiang is obviously different, and the average dust aerosol optical depth (DOD) in spring is higher than that in other seasons. The sources of natural dust have little variation and are primarily located in Lop Nur, on the edges of the Taklamakan and Gurbantunggut deserts, in the central Tuha Basin, and in dried-up lakes. The sources of anthropogenic dust are mainly distributed in the farmland areas of the oasis plain and the impact fan plain. Natural dust aerosols are dominant in Xinjiang, with high natural dust emissions in spring. Changes in anthropogenic dust aerosols are caused by production activities, and the annual average anthropogenic dust emissions account for 8% of the total dust emissions. Precipitation can promote a reduction in natural dust emissions. Topography has an obvious effect on the formation and transportation of dust aerosols, which manifests as the frequent occurrence of dust in the basin. The population density data and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data reveal, that the intensity of human activities has a great impact on anthropogenic dust aerosols. This study provides support for research on how aerosols affect climate and environmental changes in Xinjiang.

T2  - Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To aralyze the clinical characteristics of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in Beijing. Methods: Based on Beijing Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance System, acute respiratory infection patients were recruited from 35 different types of sentinel hospitals in Beijing. Their epidemiological and clinical data were systematically collected and clinical specimens were also obtained. Nuclear acid testing was performed for 30 types of respiratory pathogens (including Chlamydia pneumoniae). The identified patients of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection were divided into two groups, the acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURI) group and pneumoniae group. The differences in clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and prognosis were compared by using independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi2 test or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: A total of 119 patients of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection were included, including 12 patients in the AURI group and 107 patients in pneumoniae group. Chlamydia pneumoniae infection mainly occurred in people aged from 5 to 44 years, accounting for 81.5% (97/119). The three most common clinical symptoms were cough (92.4%, 110/119), fever (88.8%, 95/107), and sputum production (76.5%, 91/119). White blood cell counts increased in 39.3% (46/117) of patients. Neutrophile granulocyte proportion increased in 39.7% (46/116) of patients. Platelet count increased in 36.9% (41/111) of patients. An increase of the creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CKMB) was observed in 12 pneumonia patients (24.5%, 12/49). Radiological examination showed that 90.6% (87/105) of patients in the pneumoniae group had pulmonary parenchymal changes; the lesion occurred most commonly in the lower right lung lobe (34.3%, 36/105) and the lower left lung lobe (27.6%, 29/105). Although 73.8% (79/107) of patients in the pneumoniae group were hospitalized, no case received intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation. As to outcomes, one patient developed respiratory failure and 6 patients suffered myocardial injury. No death was observed in this study. The median days of hospitalization and course of illness for pneumonia patients M(P25,P75) were 10.0 (7.0, 13.0) days and 18.0 (13.5, 22.0) days, respectively. Conclusion: Generally, Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in Beijing from 2015 to 2019 were mild, and the main clinical manifestations were cough, fever and sputum. However, most patients in the pneumoniae group caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae still required hospitalization but with a better outcome.

TI  - Surgical Technique for Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling in Presumed Early-stage Ovarian Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Study Objective: Surgical staging for apparent early-stage ovarian cancer includes systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymph node evaluation to detect occult stage III disease [1]. Although, lymphadenectomy procedure is associated with increased duration of surgery and a 13% risk of lymphocyst formation [2]. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is still investigational, and no standardized approach has been studied. Recent mounting evidence has approved the applicability of SLN technique in early-stage ovarian cancer [3,4]. The objective of this video is to demonstrate a surgical technique for robotic performance of SLN biopsy in presumed early-stage ovarian cancer.Design: Stepwise demonstration of the robotic technique for SLN sampling in presumed early-stage ovarian cancer. This video report is part of an institutional, investigational review board-approved study.Setting: Academic tertiary referral center.Interventions: This video presents our team's robotic technique for SLN sampling in a 37-year-old woman who presented to our center with a 10-cm right complex adnexal mass, suspicious for malignancy. A 27-gauge spinal needle was inserted through the abdominal wall under direct visualization. We injected 0.5 mL of dilute indocyanine green solution (Novadaq Technologies, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) (1.25 mg/mL) subperitoneally into the utero-ovarian ligament. The SLN was checked with the fluorescence-guided camera of the Xi DaVinci robotic system (Sunnyvale, CA). Eight to 10 minutes after the injection, a right para-aortic SLN was identified, and dissection was performed. After dissection, the node was extracted and sent to pathology for evaluation by ultra-staging. The final pathology revealed a stage IA low-grade serous ovarian cancer.Conclusion: SLN sampling appears to be feasible in presumed early-stage ovarian cancer and may allow the avoidance of systematic lymph node dissection in this set of patients.

TI  - The use of machine learning methods to estimate aboveground biomass of grasslands: A review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - The study of grasslands using machine learning (ML) methods combined with proximal/remote sensing data (RS) has been steadily increasing in the last decades. Available algorithms range from a primarily academic use to more widespread practical applications intended at helping farm management. Here, we review the use of ML methods applied to aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in grassland systems. Based on 26 recent papers, we perform a literature review of the topic to identify common practices, namely the relation between estimation performance and the ML method used, data sources, and scale (local/regional). In order to identify the relation between the characteristics of the studies and the estimation accuracy, we use descriptive and correlation analysis. In spite of a surge in the number of papers and application examples, there is no evidence that the estimation performance of the algorithms has been improving over time. In all approaches used by the authors of the papers herein considered, the number of field samples, RS data source, and species composition of the grassland systems are the most relevant variables to explain the estimation accuracy. This accuracy increases with the number of field samples until it plateaus, hinting at the existence of an optimum level for monitoring efforts. Accuracy also increases with the proximity of the sensor to the field, i.e., on average accuracy is higher using field spectroscopy than using satellite data. There is no evidence that any particular ML method is more suited to this problem. The literature also displays significant limitations in terms of its applications of the ML algorithms. For example, a limited number of papers validated the models, casting doubt on the potential of the models for generalized application. Despite those limitations, and considering the advancements verified, we expect that, in the near future, ML methods combined with RS/proximal data will continue to improve and be helpful for farm management.

TI  - Alteration of the Fogera Plain flood regime due to Ribb Dam construction, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED WATER ENGINEERING AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fogera Plain, Ethiopia, is affected by recurrent flooding of the Ribb and Gumara Rivers. A large dam on the Ribb River is under construction for irrigation, but also to reduce flooding. We investigated the effects of the dam on the flood regime of the floodplain wetlands using a combination of hydrodynamic and a rainfall-runoff models. The model was calibrated based on inundation maps retrieved from Landsat images. Pre- and post-dam model comparison for 10 years shows that the dam will reduce the flooding extent by 11%, as it only regulates 23.8% of the upstream watershed. The flood extent and duration necessary to maintain ecologically significant water depths (>= 0.5 m) show no notable changes. The developed hydrologic and hydrodynamic models can be used to analyze other dam operation and climate change scenarios even though there are uncertainties related to terrain resolution and analysis of hydrological data.

TI  - A Study on the Detection Rates and Location of Sentinel Lymph Node in Patients with Gynecologic Cancers
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node mapping is emerging as an accurate technique to assess the lymph nodal status while reducing surgical and postoperative morbidity. Present study looks into the detection rates and location of sentinel nodes during Sentinel node mapping when Indocyanine green dye was used as a tracer. Methods This is a single institutional study with details retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. All patients who underwent sentinel node mapping using ICG dye for atypical hyperplasia, endometrial and cervical cancers from February 2015 to April 2020 were included. Location of the sentinel node was taken from the graphical record maintained during surgery. The data obtained are expressed as number and percentage and/or mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Chi-square test was performed to compare categorical variables. Results Two hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent sentinel node mapping with ICG dye during this period. Mapping was successful in 270 patients (96.8%) with 85% having successful bilateral mapping. Obturator was the most common location (52%) followed by external iliac (34%). There was no significant difference in detection among patients with BMI less than 30 or more than 30. The detection rate across various histologies of endometrial cancer was also similar. Conclusion Sentinel node mapping using ICG dye has got excellent overall and bilateral detection rates making it a valuable tool. Obturator was found to be the most common location for the sentinel node. Mapping using ICG dye yield good detection rates in all histologies of endometrial cancer and in patients with high BMI.

TI  - Characterization of the main land processes occurring in Europe (2000-2018) through a MODIS NDVI seasonal parameter-based procedure
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and recognition of the land processes are of vital importance for a proper management of the ecosystem functions and services. However, on-ground land uses/land covers (LULC) characterization is a timeconsuming task, often limited to small land areas, which can be solved using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this work is to investigate how the different MODIS NDVI seasonal parameters responded to the main land processes observed in Europe in the 2000-2018 period; characterizing their temporal trend; and evaluating which one reflected better each specific land process. NDVI time-series were evaluated using TIMESAT software, which extracted eight seasonality parameters: amplitude, base value, length of season, maximum value, left and right derivative values and small and large integrated values. These parameters were correlated with the LULC changes derived from COoRdination of INformation on the Environment Land Cover (CLC) for assessing which parameter better characterized each land process. The temporal evolution of the maximum seasonal NDVI was the parameter that better characterized the occurrence of most of the land processes evaluated (afforestation, agriculturalization, degradation, land abandonment, land restoration, urbanization; R2 from 0.670.97). Large integrated value also presented significant relationships but they were restricted to two of the three evaluated periods. On the contrary, land processes involving CLC categories with similar NDVI patterns were not well captured with the proposed methodology. These results evidenced that this methodology could be combined with other classification methods for improving LULC identification accuracy or for identifying LULC processes in locations where no LULC maps are available. Such information can be used by policy-makers to draw of (2021) LULC management actions associated with sustainable development goals. This is especially relevant for areas where food security is at stake and where terrestrial ecosystems are threatened by severe biodiversity loss. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An improved non-linear inter-calibration method on different radiometers for enhancing coverage of daily LST estimates in low latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most polar-orbit-satellite based passive microwave radiometers, e.g. AMSR-2 and the FY-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (FY3B-MWRI), have the revisit cycles of-2 days in low latitudes. This indicates that requirement of complete global coverage on the daily basis has not been met. On the other hand, using synergistic observations from different radiometers seems promising to enhance the temporal resolution of observations in such areas, whereas cross-radiometer inter-calibration is essential prior to their synergism. For this purpose, conventional inter-calibration models are usually built based on linear relations of brightness temperature (TB) between different radiometers. However, the linear model has relatively poor performance in low latitudes primarily due to wet surface conditions. In this study, we propose an improved non-linear model for calibrating MWRI TB against AMSR-2 TB at 18.7 GHz and 23.8 GHz channels. Global land surface temperature (LST) is estimated using the post-calibration MWRI TB data and then validated against AMSR-2 based LST, MODIS based LST, and in situ near-surface air temperature datasets in low latitudes respectively. The validation results show that LST outcome based on the improved non-linear inter-calibration method has smaller global Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) below 3.5 K, compared with the RMSEs of-6 K obtained from the conventional linear inter-calibration method and from the results without inter-calibration. Further analysis also shows that synergistic observations between AMSR-2 and MWRI are capable of shortening the maximum global revisit cycle of AMSR-2 LST from-2 days to less than 1.2 days. These results indicate that the improved inter-calibration method is effective for obtaining daily LST datasets with quasi-complete global coverage and reliable accuracy.

TI  - Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes between Minimally Invasive Sentinel Node Biopsy and Full Lymphadenectomy for Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To review the perioperative differences between patients undergoing a minimally invasive sentinel lymph node dissection and those undergoing a full lymphadenectomy.Design: Retrospective review.Setting: Teaching hospital.Patients: All patients undergoing a minimally invasive procedure for endometrial cancer that included nodal evaluation.Interventions: Patients who underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy were compared with those who underwent a full lymphadenectomy at the time of minimally invasive surgery by either laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery.Measurements and Main Results: A total of 241 minimally invasive surgery procedures for endometrial cancer were performed during the 20-month study period. Nodal dissection was indicated and performed in 156 (65%) of these patients, with 93 undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy and 63 a full lymphadenectomy. There was no difference between the sentinel group and the lymphadenectomy group with respect to age, estimated blood loss (p = .23), use of a preoperative enhanced recovery after surgery program (p = .82), or body mass index (34.0 kg/m(2) vs 33.7 kg/m(2); p = .87). The use of full lymphadenectomy was very dependent on the surgeon (p < .001). There was no difference in narcotic use in milligram intravenous equivalents of morphine in surgery (20.9 vs 22.2; p = .37), recovery (4.6 vs 4.9; p = .73), or total dose (25.4 vs 27.0; p = .33). The surgical procedure was longer with lymphadenectomy (185.2 minutes vs 214.2 minutes; p < .001) and the relative risk of discharge from recovery was lower (0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.97; p = .03). The hospital stay was longer with lymphadenectomy (16.3 hours vs 25.5 hours; p < .001) and same-day discharge less frequent (48.5% vs 13.8%; p < .001). A multivariate analysis confirmed that sentinel node biopsy was associated with an increased relative risk of discharge of 1.68 (95% confidence interval 1.11-2.53; p = .01)Conclusion: Total narcotic requirements are similar between sentinel node biopsy and lymphadenectomy. However, sentinel node biopsy is associated with a shorter surgical time, recovery time, and hospital stay. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of AAGL.

TI  - Anatomic Asymmetry in Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To determine whether the concomitant use of indocyanine green (ICG) with technetium-99m- filtered sulfur colloid (Tc99m-FSC) improves bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate in endometrial cancer and whether anatomic concordance of pelvic lymph nodes exists and can be used to predict SLN location in cases of unilateral mapping failure.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: Tertiary academic medical center in Holon, Israel.Patients: Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, who underwent SLN mapping with Tc99m-FSC, ICG, or both, at our center between 2014 and 2019.Interventions: A total of 111 patients were included in the study. SLN mapping using Tc99m-FSC was performed in 101 (91.9%) patients, and ICG injection was given to 64 (57.6%) patients of whom 55 (49.5%) received both. We compared SLN detection rates (unilateral and bilateral) and anatomic symmetry for each method alone and for a combination of the 2.Measurements and Main Results: The overall detection rate for unilateral SLNs was 96.4%; 96.9% with ICG, 93.1% with gamma-probe, and 98.2% by combining both methods. The total bilateral detection rate was 72.1%, with ICG performing better as a single tracer than Tc99m-FSC (75% vs 63.4%, respectively). In 55 women in whom both tracers were used, the bilateral detection rate was significantly higher compared with Tc99m-FSC alone. Symmetric pelvic anatomic concordance of SLN was found in only 35 of 80 patients with bilateral SLN detection (43.8%).Conclusion: The combination of preoperative radioisotope injection and intraoperative ICG administration may yield the best bilateral SLN detection rate. In cases of unilateral mapping failure, one cannot rely on the anatomic location of the ipsilateral SLN detected to harvest the complementary node because the symmetric concordance is poor.

TI  - Assessing vegetation stability to climate variability in Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic climate change has far-reaching impacts on vegetation in drylands such as Central Asia. Recent attempts to assess vegetation stability to short-term climate variability often account solely for vegetation sensitivity or resilience but ignore the composite effects of these two indicators. Meanwhile, our understanding of the vegetation stability at the seasonal scale remains insufficient. In this study, considering the cumulative effects of vegetation response to three key climate factors, we assessed the stability of vegetation in Central Asia using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the meteorological data from 1982 to 2014 by integrating vegetation sensitivity and resilience, and further identified the critical regions and seasons of vegetation that experience high risks of pending change. The results show that the sensitivity of vegetation has a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.001) with the aridity index (AI), with the vegetation of drier areas having lower sensitivities to climate variability. At the temporal scale, the sensitivity of vegetation to climate variability varied among different seasons. The average vegetation sensitivity index (VSI) is 41.17, 33.32 and 28.63 in spring, summer and autumn, respectively. Spatially, a trade-off between vegetation sensitivity and resilience is found both for the growing season (R-2 = 0.67) and seasonal scale (R-2 = 0.71, 0.32 and 0.43 for spring, summer and autumn, respectively), regions with high vegetation sensitivity were always accompanied by strong resilience. Based on the relationship between vegetation sensitivity and resilience, we further identify the critical regions and periods of vegetation with high change risk in Central Asia. Results suggest that herbaceous plants in semiarid areas present high instability, especially in summer. This study offers a comprehensive perspective to assess vegetation stability to climate variability and the results will facilitate the protection of ecosystems and the implementation of sustainable development goals in Central Asia.

TI  - The design and fabrication of nanoengineered platinum needles with laser welded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the electrochemical biosensing of cancer lymph nodes
T2  - BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new biosensor for detecting cancer involved sentinel lymph nodes has been developed via the electrochemical tracing of fatty acid oxidation as a distinct metabolism of malignant cells invading lymph nodes (LNs). The system included integrated platinum needle electrodes that were decorated by carbon nanotubes (as hydrophobic agents) through laser-assisted nanowelding. It was applied to record the dielectric spectroscopy data from LN contents via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The system was applied for dielectric spectroscopy of LN contents via electrochemical impedance approach. The reduced lipid content of involved LNs, due to fat metabolism by invasive cancer cells, would decrease the charge transfer resistance (R-CT) of the LNs with respect to their normal counterparts. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with superhydrophobic properties were used to enhance the interaction of Pt needle electrodes with the lipidic contents of lymph nodes. This is the first time that a fatty acid metabolism-based sensing approach has been introduced to detect involved LNs. Moreover, a novel electrode decorating method was applied to enhance the interfacial contact of this lipid detection probe (LDP). In order to avoid doubt about the biocompatibility of ferrocyanide, [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) and ferricyanide, [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), a biocompatible injectable metal ion-based material, ferric carboxymaltose, was selected and applied as the electrolyte for the first time. Rabbit LNs were tested using the LDP in the animal model phase. The system was then used in vitro on 122 dissected human LNs in the operating room. Calibration of the results showed an excellent match between the dielectric response of the LDP (known as charge transfer resistance (R-CT)) and the final pathological diagnoses. The LDP may have a promising future after further clinical investigations for intra-operative distinction between normal and cancerous LNs.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The genomic tests such as the MammaPrint and Oncotype DX test are being gradually applied for hormone receptor positive/HER-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer patients with up to three positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). The first results from RxPONDER trial suggested that Oncotype DX could be applied to patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), which constituted 37.4% of the intent-to-treat population. However, there was no distinctive research on how to apply genomic tests precisely to HR+/HER2- patients with 1-2 positive SLNs without ALND. The purpose was to construct a nomogram using the multi-center retrospective data to predict precisely which HR+/HER2- candidates with 1-2 positive SLNs could be subjected to genomic tests (<= 3 positive lymph nodes).Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 18,600 patients with stage I-III breast cancer patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in Shandong Cancer Hospital, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, and West China Hospital. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent predictive factors of having <= 3 positive nodes among patients with 1-2 positive SLNs. A nomogram was developed based on variables in the final model with pResults: Based on the database of the three institutions, a total of 18,600 breast cancer patients were identified undergoing SLNB between May 2010 and 2020. Among the 1817 HR+/HER2- patients with 1-2 positive SLNs undergoing ALND, 84.2% harbored <= 3 totals metastatic ALNs. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified imaging abnormal nodes (OR=0.197, 95%CI: 0.082-0.472), the number of positive SLNs (OR=0.351, 95%CI: 0.266-0.464), the number of negative SLNs (OR=1.639, 95%CI: 1.465-1.833), pathological tumor stage (OR=0.730, 95%CI: 0.552-0.964), and lympho-vascular invasion (OR=0.287, 95%CI: 0.222-0.398) as independent predictors for the proportion of patients with <= 3 total metastatic ALNs (all p<0.05). These five predictors were used to create a predictive nomogram. The AUC value was 0.804 (95%CI: 0.681-0.812, p<0.001). The calibration curve showed a satisfactory fit between the predictive and actual observation based on internal validation with a bootstrap resampling frequency of 1000.Conclusion: The nomogram based on the multi-centric database showed a good accuracy and could assist the oncologist in determining precisely which HR+/HER2- candidates with 1-2 positive SLNs without ALND could perform genomic tests. In the era of SLNB and precision medicine, the combined application of genomic tests and SLNB could provide patients with a better strategy of dual de-escalation management, including the de-escalation of both surgery and systemic treatment.

TI  - Who gets treated for influenza: A surveillance study from the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We describe the baseline characteristics and complications of individuals with influenza in the US FDA's Sentinel System by antiviral treatment timing. Design: Retrospective cohort design. Patients: Individuals aged >= 6 months with outpatient diagnoses of influenza in June 2014-July 2017, 3 influenza seasons. Methods: We identified the comorbidities, vaccination history, influenza testing, and outpatient antiviral dispensings of individuals with influenza using administrative claims data from 13 data partners including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, integrated delivery systems, and commercial health plans. We assessed complications within 30 days: hospitalization, oxygen use, mechanical ventilation, critical care, ECMO, and death. Results: There were 1,090,333 influenza diagnoses in 2014-2015; 1,005,240 in 2016-2017; and 578,548 in 2017-2018. Between 49% and 55% of patients were dispensed outpatient treatment within 5 days. In all periods >80% of treated individuals received treatment on the day of diagnosis. Those treated on days 1-5 after diagnosis had higher prevalences of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and obesity compared to those treated on the day of diagnosis or not treated at all. They also had higher rates of hospitalization, oxygen use, and critical care. In 2014-2015, among those aged >= 65 years, the rates of hospitalization were 45 per 1,000 diagnoses among those treated on day 0; 74 per 1,000 among those treated on days 1-5; and 50 per 1,000 among those who were untreated. Conclusions: In a large, national analysis, approximately half of people diagnosed with influenza in the outpatient setting were treated with antiviral medications. Delays in outpatient dispensed treatment were associated with higher prevalence of comorbidities and higher rates of complication.

TI  - What drives clearing of old-growth forest over secondary forests in tropical shifting cultivation systems? Evidence from the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A key issue in understanding tropical forest disturbance is what drives farmers practicing customary shifting cultivation to clear crop fields in old-growth forest over secondary forest fallows. These farmers typically hold a stock of secondary forest fallows that can be used for cropping in rotation, built up over time in part through initial clearing of old-growth forest. In this paper we examine the most recent field cleared by 2046 indigenous and folk peasant households in 138 communities along three major rivers of the Peruvian Amazon to identify the factors that influence their choice of field location (upland or lowland forests) and type of forest cleared (oldgrowth or secondary). Data are drawn from a large-scale household and community surveys and remote sensing analysis of Landsat and ArcGIS Worldview imagery. We find that rates of old-growth forest clearing are low and that such land quickly returns to secondary forest cover: about 31% of households cleared forest on the upland (terra firme) but only 8% of households cleared upland old-growth forest. Regression modeling results identify the contextual, historical and household factors that influence the choice to clear upland forest (old-growth or secondary). Access to lowland for floodplain agriculture is associated with lower rates of old-growth forest clearing and higher educational attainment of household heads with increased clearing. Analysis of household land portfolios points to the importance of the size of land holdings, the degree of upland orientation, and the number and age of fallows held at the time of the forest clearing decision in clearing old-growth forest on the upland. Measures to reduce old-growth forest loss around Amazonian communities are discussed.

TI  - Identifying meaningful covariates that can improve the interpolation of monsoon rainfall in a low-lying tropical region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of spatio-temporal distribution of rainfall over the entire monsoon season is critical for the water resources management in a tropical low-lying region like Bangladesh. The primary objective is to find suitable interpolation methods for each monsoon month as well as the accumulated rainfall for the entire season in Bangladesh. As the unique position of Bangladesh and monsoon system both contribute the variation in rainfall, the identification of associated suitable covariates can offer reliable estimates when applied with the appropriate interpolation model. Several potential covariates are identified diligently including the remotely sensed annul average monsoon rainfall (RAAMR), distance to Bay-of-Bengal and distance to Hindu-Kush Himalayan Region, among others. This study mainly considers the multivariate approach: kriging with external drift (KED) which is able to take external information to positive impact. The method is then compared with the more traditional univariate, ordinary kriging (OK) and the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method using the cross-validation technique. Daily rainfall data from 1970 to 2016 at 34 stations were used for the assessment. Result shows that the KED model is identified suitable for the considered variants of June, August, September and annual average monsoon rainfall whereas the OK is appropriate for July. Overall, the KED is found superior model with the incorporation of RAAMR data. The successful inclusion of remotely sensed data in the kriging system paves a new dimension in the climatological research for countries where climate-measuring resources are limited.

TI  - Reanalysis profile downscaling with WRF model and sensitivity to PBL parameterization schemes over a subtropical station
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric profiles are essential in weather prediction, atmospheric research, and satellite data calibration. In this study, we assess the use of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to downscaling NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) reanalysis atmospheric profiles. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to Yonsei University (YSU) and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) parameterization schemes. WRF simulations were carried out using two nested grids with horizontal resolutions of 12 and 3 km. Simulated profiles were evaluated against radiosonde observations in Southern Brazil. Results indicate that WRF can skillfully simulate vertical profiles of water vapor mixing ratio (q) and potential temperature (theta). The entire profile comparison yielded high correlation coefficients (mostly higher than 0.9), low moist and cold average biases, and overall RMSE (MAE) of 0.84 (0.44) g/Kg and 2.30 (1.61) K for q and theta, respectively. In the lower troposphere (0-3 km), errors are larger for q and lower for theta. Statistically, there is no significant difference in the retrieved profiles on increasing the horizontal resolution. The setting choice is a compromise between spatial detail needs and computational cost. Furthermore, the overall results did not indicate any particular PBL scheme that stands out in all case days. The performance depends on the meteorological conditions that prevail in the different cases. The WRF model and even data directly from NCEP CFSv2 reanalysis are useful to represent the vertical structure of the atmosphere when local radiosondes are not available.

TI  - An integrated metabolomics and proteogenomics approach reveals molecular alterations following carbamazepine exposure in the male mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbamazepine is one of the most abundant pharmaceutical active compounds detected in aquatic systems. Based on laboratory exposures, carbamazepine has been proven to adversely affect aquatic organisms. However, the underlying molecular events remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms potentially associated with toxicological effects of carbamazepine on the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed for 3 days at realistic concentrations encountered in coastal environments (80 ng/L and 8 mu g/L). An integrated metabolomics and proteogenomics approach, including data fusion strategy, was applied to gain more insight in molecular events and cellular processes triggered by carbamazepine exposure. Consistent metabolic and protein signatures revealed a metabolic rewiring and cellular stress at both concentrations (e.g. intensification of protein synthesis, transport and catabolism processes, disruption of lipid and amino acid metabolisms). These highlighted molecular signatures point to the induction of autophagy, closely related with carbamazepine mechanism of action, as well as a destabilization of the lysosomal membranes and an enzymatic overactivity of the peroxisomes. Induction of programmed cell death was highlighted by the modulation of apoptotic cognate proteins. The proposed integrative omics data analysis was shown to be highly relevant to identify the modulations of the two molecular levels, i.e. metabolites and proteins. Multi-omics approach is able

TI  - Evaluation of an urban drainage system and its resilience using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing number of pluvial floods due to extreme climatic events or poor maintenance of the drainage networks urge for assessing the performance of the urban drainage system (UDS). This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the UDS of Gurugram City, India. While the limited availability of sub-hourly precipitation and finer resolution geospatial data pose major challenges in the detailed analyses through Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), it was circumvented by utilizing the high-resolution remotely sensed datasets viz., IMERG (half-hourly precipitation data from 2000 to 2019), ALOS PALSAR (Digital Elevation Model) and Sentinel-2 (land use/land cover). Functional failure scenarios (i.e., the combinations of climate change and urbanization) were simulated to assess the impacts on the resilience of the UDS. The modelling results showed that individually, climate change would impose a more serious threat than urbanization, whereas their combinations would significantly hamper the resilience of the UDS. The structural failure (only single link-failure) scenarios were analyzed, and 11 out of 25 conduits were identified to be non-resilient. The study highlights the importance of the readily available remote sensing datasets, which fill the gap of non-availability of ground-based datasets at desirable resolutions, especially in developing countries.

TI  - Pandemic Impacts for Indigenous Children and Youth Within Canada: An Ethical Analysis
T2  - YOUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to new and exacerbated challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Indigenous children and youth in Canada have developed innovative and holistic solutions to amplify their voices, continue cultural engagement and combat social isolation for themselves and their communities as a whole. In this analysis, we have selected three Indigenous philosophical tenets as an ethical orientation for discussion of how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the well-being of Indigenous young people. The guiding values of interconnected relationships, holism and Indigenous-informed restorative justice help us interpret existing pandemic-specific literature and identify, define and prioritize considerations of child and youth well-being from an Indigenous-centred worldview. This analysis can (a) help inform future pandemic measures affecting Indigenous young people and (b) foster similar considerations for Indigenous communities in other regions of the world.

TI  - Tracing the Long-Term Evolution of Land Cover in an Alpine Valley 1820-2015 in the Light of Climate, Glacier and Land Use Changes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine glacial environments and their fluvial systems are among those landscapes most comprehensively affected by climate change. Typically, studies on the consequences of climate change in such environments, e.g., glacier retreat, cover a maximum of 70 years, reflecting the availability of orthophotos or satellite images. This study addresses the long-term transformation processes in a glaciated catchment and highlights the role of human agency in a changing Alpine environment. In order to identify land cover changes between 1820 and 2015 in the Long-Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) site "Jamtal" (Tyrol, Austria) we apply a "regressive-iterative GIS reconstruction method" combining both historical maps and optical remote sensing data. Below 2,100 ma.s.l. the Jamtal experienced a massive 62% decline of unvegetated debris areas and bedrock outcrops (so-called "wasteland") that was mainly transformed to grassland and sparsely wooded areas. Forests increased by an outstanding 323% and grassland was replaced by sparsely or densely wooded areas. This primarily reflects the abandonment of agricultural uses at unfavourable remote sites. In the higher (formerly) glaciated subbasin, ice-covered areas declined by 55%, which was associated with a major (82%) growth of exposed wasteland. Concurrently, Alpine grassland expanded by 196% and krumholz even by 304%. Approximately half of the new fluvial system that evolved in deglaciated areas between 1870 and 1921 still existed in 2015. Unconsolidated debris buried almost one fifth of the new channels, and almost one third was colonized by vegetation. Recent data show that the deglaciation process is much faster than the colonization process by Alpine vegetation. Accordingly, the extent of wasteland has expanded and potentially amplifies the sediment supply to the fluvial system. Alterations in high Alpine hydrological and sediment/debris regimes significantly affect human use in lower, more favourable areas of the Alpine region. The long-term investigation of the Alpine landscape reveals that the transformation processes have accelerated in recent decades.

TI  - A Simulation-Based Error Budget of the TES Method for the Design of the Spectral Configuration of the Micro-Bolometer-Based MISTIGRI Thermal Infrared Sensor
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In preparation of the micro-bolometer-based MIcro Satellite for Thermal Infrared GRound surface Imaging (MISTIGRI) mission, we study the error budget of the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) method using several spectral configurations that differ in channel numbers, locations, and widths. The error budget quantifies the contribution of 1) the TES underlying assumption about emissivity spectral contrast, 2) the errors on atmospheric corrections, and 3) the instrumental noise. When dealing with atmospheric corrections, we consider errors in atmospheric temperature, water vapor content, and concentrations of CO2 and O-3. To that end, we design an end-to-end simulator of MISTIGRI measurements in order to simulate the radiative and biophysical quantities involved in the data processing. We conduct numerous simulations over a wide range of realistic setups that include cavity effect, i.e., radiance trapping within vegetation canopy. In the case of micro-bolometer-based sensing, the current study highlights that atmospheric and instrumental noises have similar impacts on the TES retrievals, with resulting errors twice as large as those due to the TES intrinsic assumption about spectral contrast, where the latter contributes to the TES error budget within the [0.005-0.009] interval for emissivity, and within the [0.3-0.4 K] interval for land surface temperature (LST). Also, we show that retrieval performance of surface temperature is very similar across all considered MISTIGRI spectral configurations, with RMSE variation within 0.2 K. Eventually, our study permits us to select a 4-channels spectral configuration as the most suited for the MISTIGRI instrument, notably because it enables a moderately better capture of the emissivity contrast than a 3-channels one.

T2  - MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Innovations in Clean Energy Technologies (ICET)
CL  - Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol, Bhopal, INDIA
AB  - During summer, the demand for electric energy consumption significantly changes in urban heat islands (UHI). The paper illustrates the impact on the electric power consumption of urban heat islands for Kota city (Rajasthan). Air temperature of urban area is often higher than rural area because of the heat trapped by virtue of properties possessed by construction materials and urban geometry of buildings, as well as by air-conditioning systems. Studies reveal that urbanization has also great impacts on human health prominently related to skin and dehydration. Landsat temporal images were used to get the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference built-up indices (NDBI) for 2000, 2009, and 2020. The pro-posed method applies to geographic information system (GIS) environment for storing, analyzing, and change detection in the urban thermal environment and associated energy consumption. Sampling sta-tions were taken into consideration with UHI linked with electric consumption for Kota city. Data of LST (from Landsat images), building electricity consumption data (from grid substations), and built-up area data (from NDBI index) was collected, after that with the help of GIS, maps were developed. A strong cor-relation is been observed for highly urbanized areas with a significant rise in localized temperatures of those areas. For the communities studied, the results also indicate that electrical energy consumption also affected by urban heat islands. The result of the indices shows a positive correlation between LST & NDBI and furthermore, this concludes that the electric consumption of the UHI is influenced by LST and NDBI.

TI  - Integrated analyses of fecal indicator bacteria, microbial source tracking markers, and pathogens for Southeast Asian beach water quality assessment
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of coastal water quality from fecal pollution poses a health risk to visitors at recreational beaches. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are a proxy for fecal pollution; however the accuracy of their representation of fecal pollution health risks at recreational beaches impacted by non-point sources is disputed due to non-human derivation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FIB and a range of culturable and molecular-based microbial source tracking (MST) markers and pathogenic bacteria, and physicochemical parameters and rainfall. Forty-two marine water samples were collected from seven sampling stations during six events at two tourist beaches in Thailand. Both beaches were contaminated with fecal pollution as evident from the GenBac3 marker at 88%-100% detection and up to 8.71 log10 copies/100 mL. The human-specific MST marker human polyomaviruses JC and BK (HPyVs) at up to 4.33 log10 copies/100 mL with 92%-94% positive detection indicated that human sewage was likely the main contamination source. CrAssphage showed lower frequencies and concentrations; its correlations with the FIB group (i.e., total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci) and GenBac3 diminished its use as a human-specific MST marker for coastal water. Human-specific culturable AIM06 and SR14 bacteriophages and general fecal indicator coliphages also showed less sensitivity than the human-specific molecular assays. The applicability of the GenBac3 endpoint PCR assay as a lower-cost prescreening step prior to the GenBac3 qPCR assay was supported by its 100% positive predictive value, but its limited negative predictive values required subsequent qPCR confirmation. Human enteric adenovirus and Vibrio cholerae were not found in any of the samples. The HPyVs related to Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and 5-d rainfall records, all of which were more prevalent and concentrated during the wet season. More monitoring is therefore recommended during wet periods. Temporal differences but no spatial differences were observed, suggesting the need for a sentinel site at each beach for routine monitoring. The exceedance of FIB water quality standards did not indicate increased prevalence or concentrations of the HPyVs or Vibrio spp. pathogen group, so the utility of FIB as an indicator of health risks at tropical beaches maybe challenged. Accurate assessment of fecal pollution by incorporating MST markers could lead to developing a more effective water quality monitoring plan to better protect human health risks in tropical recreational beaches.

TI  - COVID-19 spread, detection, and dynamics in Bogota, Colombia
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Latin America has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic but estimations of rates of infections are very limited and lack the level of detail required to guide policy decisions. We implemented a COVID-19 sentinel surveillance study with 59,770 RT-PCR tests on mostly asymptomatic individuals and combine this data with administrative records on all detected cases to capture the spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bogota from June 2020 to early March 2021. We describe various features of the pandemic that appear to be specific to a middle income countries. We find that, by March 2021, slightly more than half of the population in Bogota has been infected, despite only a small fraction of this population being detected. The initial buildup of immunity contributed to the containment of the pandemic in the first and second waves. We also show that the share of the population infected by March 2021 varies widely by occupation, socio-economic stratum, and location. This, in turn, has affected the dynamics of the spread with different groups being infected in the two waves. Detailed information on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in Latin America by occupation, socioeconomic group and geographic area are rarely available. Here, the authors provide these estimates for in Bogota, Colombia using data from a sentinel surveillance scheme, and find that over half the population had been infected by March 2021.

TI  - Fine-scale leaf chlorophyll distribution across a deciduous forest through two-step model inversion from Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a key physiological trait and is crucial for monitoring plant health and accurately modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, spatially-continuous information on LCC variability at fine time-steps, and at fine spatial resolutions across regional spatial extents, is sparse. In this study, we improved a physically-based, two-step inversion approach by using an advanced canopy-to-leaf reflectance conversion model to estimate LCC at fine spatial resolution (20 m) from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The first step is to convert MSI canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance using look-up tables constructed from a geometric optical model (4-Scale). The second step is to estimate LCC from the modeled leaf reflectance using the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. Both leaf reflectance and LCC derived from MSI were validated against field measurements at a mixed temperate forest site in Canada to examine the accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) and LCC retrievals. The results demonstrate robust canopy-level inversions with strong relationships between measured and MSI-derived leaf reflectance (R-2 = 0.995, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.0143). The modeled LCC results were also strong when compared to measured LCC samples: R-2 = 0.849, p < 0.001, and RMSE = 0.304 mu g/cm(2), respectively. The most important Sentinel-2 MSI band for LAI and LCC derivation was centered at 705 nm (Band 5). Importantly, this two-step radiative transfer inversion approach substantially improved upon the current LAI and LCC algorithms adopted by the Sentinel-2 Application Platform, which underestimated LAI by 52.93% and overestimated LCC by 44.45%. This work highlights the potential of the physically-based two-step inversion method for deriving leaf and canopy traits from Sentinel-2 at very fine spatial and temporal resolutions, for a wide range of terrestrial ecological applications.

TI  - Linking soil bacterial diversity to satellite-derived vegetation productivity: a case study in arid and semi-arid desert areas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing studies have begun to focus on biodiversity-productivity relationships for soil microorganisms through molecular ecology methods. However, most of these studies involve controlled experiments, and whether the relationship remains at large spatial scales is still largely unknown. To unravel this issue, archived desert soils from long-term experiments were analysed using high-throughput sequencing, and satellite-derived vegetation datasets were acquired to quantify productivity. Most of the abundant genera were significantly different between low- and high-productivity conditions, and soil bacterial communities were strongly impacted by productivity. Soil bacterial biodiversity, including observed operational taxonomic units and the Chao1, Shannon, and Faith's PD indexes, increased rapidly with productivity at low levels and then reached a relatively stable state, and similar phenomena were observed at multiple taxonomic ranks and for most of the dominant groups. Furthermore, we discovered that the mechanisms resulting in the observed relationship might be ecosystem resource availability in large-scale regions and species competition in local regions. Collectively, these results enhance our understanding of the linkage between belowground microorganisms and aboveground vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas and confirm the potential value of satellite-derived datasets in research on soil microbial diversity at large spatial scales.

TI  - Revealing novel interactions between oak and <i>Tubakia</i> species: evidence of the efficacy of the sentinel arboreta strategy
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the sentinel arboreta strategy was applied, and its efficacy was evaluated at the Ataturk Arboretum (Istanbul, Turkey), having as a study case the interaction Tubakia spp.-Quercus spp. Thirty-four oak species native of America and Eurasia were sampled within the Fagaceae collection of the arboretum. Isolation trials were conducted from leaf necroses, and High Throughput Sequencing for fungal taxa was carried out from asymptomatic leaf blades. Four Tubakia species were identified, T. dryina, T. suttoniana, T. hallii, and T. macnabbii. Three out of four are of recent description and the present study contributed to updating their host-range. Thirty-two oak-Tubakia interactions new to science were described. Hypotheses were formulated on the possible movement across geographic areas of these species and on the risk posed in case of introduction in the distribution range of susceptible host species. As a conclusive remark, the present study confirmed the efficacy of the sentinel arboreta strategy to highlight new host-pathogen interactions and the risk of host-shift events.

TI  - Mercury levels in humpback whales, and other Southern Ocean marine megafauna
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury is a known potent neurotoxin. The biogeochemical cycle of mercury in the remote Antarctic region is still poorly understood, with Polar climate change contributing added complexity. Longitudinal biomonitoring of mercury accumulation in Antarctic marine megafauna can contribute top-down insight into the bio-physical drivers of wildlife exposure. The bioaccumulative nature of organic mercury renders high trophic predators at the greatest risk of elevated exposure. Humpback whales represent secondary consumers of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem and an ideal biomonitoring species for persistent and bioaccumulative compounds due to their extended life-spans. This study provides the first results of mercury accumulation in humpback whales, and places findings within the context of mercury accumulation in both prey, as well as six other species of Antarctic marine megafauna. Combined, these findings contribute new baseline information regarding mercury exposure to Antarctic wildlife, and highlights methodological prerequisites for routine mercury biomonitoring in wildlife via non-lethally biopsied superficial tissues.

TI  - Estimation and evaluation of high-resolution soil moisture from merged model and Earth observation data in the Great Britain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important component of the Earth system and plays a key role in land-atmosphere interactions. Remote sensing of soil moisture is of great scientific interest and the scientific community has made significant progress in soil moisture estimation using Earth observations. Currently, several satellite-based coarse spatial resolution soil moisture datasets have been produced and widely used for various applications in climate science, hydrology, ecosystem research and agriculture. Owing to the strong demand for soil moisture data with high spatial resolution for regional applications, much effort has recently been devoted to the generation of high spatial resolution soil moisture data from either high-resolution satellite observations or by downscaling existing coarse-resolution satellite-based soil moisture datasets. In addition, land surface models provide an alternative way to obtain consistent high-resolution soil moisture information when forced with high-resolution inputs. The aim of this study is to create and evaluate high-resolution soil moisture products derived from multiple sources including satellite observations and land surface model simulations. The JULES-CHESS simulated soil moisture and satellite-based soil moisture datasets including SMAP L3E, SMAP L4, SMOS L4, Sentinel 1, ASCAT, and Sentinel 1/SMAP combined products were first validated against observed soil moisture from COSMOS-UK, a network of in-situ cosmic-ray based sensors. Second, an approach based on triple collocation was applied to compare these satellite products in the absence of a known reference dataset. Third, a combined soil moisture product was generated to integrate the better-performing soil moisture estimates based on triple collocation error estimation and a least-squares merging scheme. From further evaluation, it is found that the merged soil moisture integrates the characteristics of model simulation and satellite observations and particularly improves the limited temporal variability of the JULES-CHESS simulation. Therefore, we conclude that the triple collocation merging scheme is a simple and reliable way to combine satellite-based soil moisture products with outputs from the JULES-CHESS simulation for estimating model-data fused high-resolution soil moisture for the British mainland.

TI  - Far-field diffraction pattern of cube corner retroreflector at oblique incidence
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Corner cube retroreflector (CCR) as a main optical component of laser ranging retroreflector array plays a key role in satellite laser ranging (SLR) to cooperative targets. To accurately estimate the echo energy of SLR, it is necessary to precompute photons' distribution in the distance of SLR station by calculating the Far field diffraction pattern (FFDP) of CCR under various conditions. In this paper, the analysis of the effective reflection area and optical reflectivity of CCR for arbitrary incidence angle are carried out, in which a method to calculate the CCR effective reflection area with a wider applicability is used, and the difference between optical reflectivity of metal-coated CCR and uncoated (total internal reflection) CCR is also discussed. On this basis, combined with optical diffraction theory, a simulation program for CCR FFDP calculation is established, thereby producing FFDPs of CCR for a variety of incidence angles under different coating conditions. The results show that the FFDP of metal-coated CCR is almost unrelated to the azimuth angle of incident light or polarization, but is determined only by elevation angle of incident light. The pattern is always like Airy spot or its tensile deformation. Relatively, uncoated CCR's FFDP has a more complex figure, its reflected energy is divided into several lobes whose size, number and position are all influenced by elevation and azimuth angle of incidence, and also by the polarization. Generally, the incidence direction which has a large total intensity of far optical field is to an extent the same as that of large effective reflection area and optical reflectivity. Furthermore, simulation results with uncoated CCR presents a higher relevance of incidence direction and FFDP.To verify the reliability and correctness of these simulation results, a diffraction optical experimental system at a wavelength of 1550 nm is set up to conduct laboratory confirmation, including laser, camera, beam expander, rotating platform and other essential optics. A silver-coated CCR and an uncoated CCR (both made of fuse silica, each has different dihedral angle offset) are chosen to measure their FFDPs with random polarization directions at several random incidence angles. All the measurement results are in good agreement with the simulations of FFDPs.

TI  - On the mechanism behind the shift of the turbidity maximum zone in response to reclamations in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary, China
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclamation in estuaries can greatly change the channel geometry and hydrodynamic conditions and these changes may have significant impacts on spatial and temporal distribution of the turbidity maximum zone. This study focuses on the effects of a large area of reclamation built in 2007-2018 and the behavior of the turbidity maximum zone along the North Channel of the Yangtze Estuary. Data were collected of bathymetry in the North Channel, tidal elevations at Sheshan Station, river discharge at Datong Station and turbidity, retrieved from six Landsat remote sensing images in the dry season from 2006 to 2019. In-situ measured data on flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration were obtained in the dry season of 2003 and 2018. Analysis of the data revealed that reclamations, which led to narrowing (0.86-2.74 km) and fixing of the channel, caused erosion of 0.19-3.72 m in the deep channel and deposition on the tidal flats. Furthermore, it was found that the length of the turbidity maximum zone decreased: its landward boundary shifted 5 km seaward during spring tide and 17 km seaward during neap tide in the dry season. The position of the seaward boundary wandered within a range of 3 km, being further downstream during neap tide than that during spring tide. A conceptual model of changes in the borders of the turbidity maximum zone in response to reclamation is proposed. After the reclamation works, the deeper and narrower channel intensified ebb-dominance of the flow velocity. The coarsening of bed sediment weakened resuspension and decreased the bottom tidally averaged suspended sediment concentration. These changes led to a significant decline in the depth-mean of tidally averaged suspended sediment concentration and caused the seaward movement of the landward boundary of the turbidity maximum zone.

TI  - Mechanism for the marked increase of <i>Ulva</i> <i>prolifera</i> in the south Yellow Sea: role of light intensity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and co-limitations
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of regulating factors and early warning of Ulva prolifera biomass increase may reduce harm or prevent bloom disasters in the Yellow Sea. We investigated the minimum nutrient concentration and light-limiting depth (Zlim) for the growth of floating U. prolifera thalli. Bioavailable dissolved nitrogen (BDN) concentrations in most parts of the study area were almost always higher than the minimum N concentrations required for the growth of floating thalli, indicating no N limitation for the growth of floating thalli. However, the minimum N concentration required for the development of germlings into thalli was higher than BDN in the majority of the area north of 35 degrees N. This indicated that germlings floating out of Subei Shoal were unable to grow into thalli because of N limitation. The minimum P concentration required for germling development was higher than the total dissolved P north of 35 degrees N. This suggested that P limitation occurred for germlings floating out of Subei Shoal. The Zlim for the floating thalli was < 0.1 m in most parts of Subei Shoal, which explained why the rapid growth of floating thalli only occurred when they floated out from the Subei Shoal. A grid pattern with the phased multiple increase in biomass per day was designed to predict the possible accumulated multiple increase in biomass (AcMp) when U. prolifera drifted northward following different trajectories. The predicted AcMp values in 2017, 2010, and 2009 were close to the ratio of the coverage area from remote sensing data. Such a grid pattern facilitates quick decisions in disaster prevention and reduction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, which appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly around the world. One of the prescribed ways to control and reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 was to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer/antiseptic with at least 70% ethanol alcohol. Unfortunately, with the introduction of alcohol to control COVID-19 in Iran, a growth of nonstandard and counterfeit alcohol consumption was witnessed. Nonstandard alcohol consumption in Iran has led to a significant increase in alcohol-related deaths during the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods and materials: This commentary presents the statistics reported by official online media about alcohol poisoning in Iran.Results: This commentary briefly describes why the outbreak happened and presents some policy implications, such as implementing a real-time Alcohol Surveillance System (ASS) to monitor, control, and adopt tailored efforts to reduce alcohol use and minimize its side effects.Conclusion: Health policymakers and researchers need to design and communicate the overall structure of the alcohol surveillance system.

TI  - The multinational and heterogeneous burden of air pollution on well-being
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a global issue, but data availability has restricted research on its impact on well-being to primarily individual and developed countries. Owing to this lack of data, there is no consensus on the factors influencing the impact of air pollution on well-being across countries. Thus, this paper aims to provide an inclusive view onto the heterogeneous impact of pollution on well-being with regard to income based on a sample of 30 countries. With monthly nitrogen dioxide changes monitored by satellite data, we estimate how individual and national income influence the impact of air pollution on the well-being of respondents to an international survey. To identify the burden of pollution on well-being, we focus on the impact of monthly changes in pollution induced by monthly changes in planetary boundary layers' height, via an instrumental variable strategy. Within countries, we find that air pollution reduces the well-being of low-income individuals and people living in highly polluted areas to a greater extent than that of others. Thus, it appears that populations in developing countries and countries with high income inequality suffer the highest burden of air pollution on their well-being than those in developed countries and countries with low income inequality. However, populations in highly polluted countries and highly productive countries are the least affected by pollution. These results show that using an economic index to assess distress associated with pollution is inappropriate for addressing its heterogeneous burden. Furthermore, habituation to pollution by populations in highly polluted countries may threaten international collaboration for pollution reduction.

TI  - Recovery of an endorheic lake after a decade of conservation efforts: Mediating the water conflict between agriculture and ecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread water losses in endorheic river basins have triggered ecological disasters. Agricultural irrigation has been one of the major drivers of water losses. It is imperative to address the water conflict between agriculture and ecosystems in arid regions, but significant gaps remain in knowledge of the water-agriculture-ecosystem nexus. The Heihe River Basin, China's second largest endorheic river basin, lost its terminal lake in the 1990 s due to a rapid decline in river discharge to the downstream area, but the lake has returned quickly since the early 2000 s. A system analysis on the recovery of the lake is performed in this study, fusing field observations, remote sensing data, and ecohydrological model simulations. The major findings show that the waning and waxing of the lake are driven remotely by agricultural irrigation in the midstream area, rather than the climate. A one-decade effort involving diversion restrictions in the middle reach, starting from 2000, has recovered the lake to the condition of the early 1970 s. Under historical climate conditions, saving extra irrigation water may change the recovery trajectory but would not significantly enhance the stability level. The aquifer connected to the lake acts as a buffer, receiving leakage from the lake under normal conditions while discharging water to the lake under dry conditions. The overall water efficiency of water conservation for lake restoration during 2002-2012 is estimated to be only 3.5% due to significant riverbed leakage in the downstream area. Nevertheless, leakage loss is beneficial to the recovery of groundwater and vegetation downstream. Whether the diversion restriction needs modification depends on the tradeoff between ecological services provided by the lake and its related ecosystems and economic benefit produced by the midstream agriculture. This study provides insight into agricultural water management and ecological conservation in endorheic river basins in a fast-changing global environment.

TI  - Towards user-adaptive remote sensing: Knowledge-driven automatic classification of Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping over large areas is essential to address a wide spectrum of socio-environmental challenges. For this reason, many global or regional land cover products are regularly released to the scientific community. Yet, the remote sensing community has not fully addressed the challenge to extract useful information from vast volumes of satellite data. Especially, major limitations concern the use of inadequate classification schemes and "black box" methods that may not match with end-users conceptualization of geographic features. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-driven methodological approach to automatically process Sentinel-2 time series in order to produce pre-classifications that can be adapted by end-users to match their requirements. The approach relies on a conceptual framework inspired from ontologies of scientific observation and geographic information to describe the representation of geographic entities in remote sensing images. The implementation consists in a three-stage classification system including an initial stage, a dichotomous stage and a modular stage. At each stage, the system firstly relies on natural language semantic descriptions of time series of spectral signatures before assigning labels of land cover classes. The implementation was tested on 75 time series of Sentinel-2 images (i.e. 2069 images) in the Southern Brazilian Amazon to map natural vegetation and water bodies as required by a local end-user, i.e. a non-governmental organization. The results confirmed the potential of the method to accurately detect water bodies (F-score = 0.874 for bodies larger than 10 m) and map natural vegetation (max F-score = 0.875), yet emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of accuracy results. In addition, it proved to be efficient to provide rapid estimates of degraded riparian forests at watershed level (R2 = 0.871). Finally, we discuss potential improvements both in the system's implementation, e.g. considering additional characteristics, and in the conceptual framework, e.g. moving from pixel- to object-based image analysis and evolving towards a hybrid system combining data- and knowledge-driven approaches.

TI  - Mapping Arctic cetaceans from space: A case study for beluga and narwhal
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergence of new technologies in remote sensing give scientists a new way to detect and monitor wildlife populations. In this study we assess the ability to detect and classify two emblematic Arctic cetaceans, the narwhal (Monodon monoceros) and beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), using very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. We analyzed 12 VHR images acquired in August 2017 and 2019, collected by the WorldView-3 satellite, which has a maximum resolution of 0.31 m per pixel. The images covered Clearwater Fiord (138.8 km(2)), an area on eastern Baffin Island, Canada where belugas spend a large part of the summer, and Tremblay Sound (127.0 km(2)), a narrow water body located on the north shore of Baffin Island that is used by narwhals during the open water season. A total of 292 beluga whales and 109 narwhals were detected in the images. This study contributes to our understanding of Arctic cetacean distribution and highlights the capabilities of using satellite imagery to detect marine mammals.

TI  - Analyzing the effects of 2D and 3D urban structures on LST changes using remotely sensed data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - 2D and 3D urban structures play an important role in characterizing Land Surface Temperature (LST). The effects of 2D urban structures on changes of LST have been studied in many studies, but less attention has been paid to the effects of 3D urban structures. Therefore, in this study, we aimed at employing LiDAR point clouds and a Landsat-8 image to investigate the effects of 2D and 3D structures on LST changes in Tartu, Estonia. To this end, LST retrieval and extraction of 2D structures were carried out using a Landsat-8 image. A 3D land cover of the study area was generated through employing random forest (RF) classifier on a joint set of features extracted from LiDAR point clouds and an orthophoto image, as a basis to identify 3D structures. The results of this study indicate a high overall accuracy (97.33%) of RF in land cover classification. Among the 2D structures, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) had a higher correlation than Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) with LST. The results also indicate the significant role of height in impervious surfaces and vegetation in increasing and decreasing LST. Finally, the results showed that the hot spots emerged in areas where the mean height of impervious surfaces was higher, while the cold spots were linked to areas of higher mean vegetation heights.

TI  - Breast cancer subtypes affect the ultrasound performance for axillary lymph node status evaluation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a retrospective analysis
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of breast cancer subtypes on the diagnostic value of axillary ultrasound for node status evaluation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Patients and methods: Pathologic node-positive breast cancer patients underwent axillary ultrasound imaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. The enrolled patients were classified into four subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched and triple-negative. Ultrasound images of axillary nodes were reviewed and were evaluated as normal or abnormal and were associated with final pathologic results. Diagnostic value of axillary ultrasound was assessed in four subtypes based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The diagnostic value of axillary ultrasound as well as clinical and pathological characteristics was compared between four breast cancer subtypes using chi-square test or fisher's exact test.Result: Luminal A subtype had highest positive predictive value (92.1%), lowest sensitivity (43.8%) and lowest negative predictive value (11.8%). Triple-negative subtype had lowest positive predictive value (73.2%), highest sensitivity (76.9%) and highest negative predictive value (59.1%) (P < 0.05). Luminal B and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched subtypes had medium sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.Conclusion: The diagnostic value of axillary ultrasound for node residue disease assessment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is different between four breast cancer subtypes.

TI  - A Portrait of Sentinel Surveillance Networks for Vector-Borne Diseases: A Scoping Review Supporting Sentinel Network Design
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are continuing to emerge globally, requiring new surveillance systems to follow increasing VBD risk for human populations. Sentinel surveillance is an approach that allows tracking of disease risk through time using limited resources. However, there is no consensus on how best to design a sentinel surveillance network in the context of VBDs. We conducted a scoping review to compare VBD sentinel surveillance systems worldwide with the aim of identifying key design features associated with effective networks. Overall, VBD surveillance networks were used most commonly for malaria, West Nile virus, and lymphatic filariasis. A total of 45 criteria for the selection of sentinel unit location were identified. Risk-based criteria were the most often used, and logistic regression showed that using risk-based criteria dependent on host animals is particularly correlated with surveillance system sensitivity (p < 0.018). We identify tools that could prove valuable for sentinel surveillance network design, including a standardized approach for evaluating surveillance systems and a tool to prioritize criteria for selecting optimal geographic locations for spatial sentinel units.

TI  - Realizing Stable High-Performance and Low-Energy-Loss Ternary Photovoltaics through Judicious Selection of the Third Component
T2  - SOLAR RRL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ternary strategy can be used to optimize the light harvesting (i.e., complementary absorption), energy level alignment, and blend morphology of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, ZY-4Cl is chosen as the third component in a PM6:Y6-based OPV. ZY-4Cl has a small highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level offset with Y6 (0.02 eV) and a small lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level offset with PM6 (0.06 eV), and provided low energy loss of 0.538 eV for the resulting ternary OPV. Furthermore, the system displayed complementary absorption and a suitable value of chi(PM6-ZY-4Cl,) and the similar chemical structures of ZY-4Cl and Y6 assured their great miscibility. The embedding of ZY-4Cl improved the light harvesting, blend morphology, exciton dissociation, bimolecular/trap-assisted recombination, and long-term stability when comparing the ternary OPV with the PM6:Y6-based binary OPV. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 15.5 +/- 0.22% for the binary OPV to 17.1 +/- 0.23% for the ternary OPV, with the best PCE reaching 17.6%. The unencapsulated ternary OPV exhibited excellent air stability, maintaining 94% of its initial PCE for over 1390 h (25 degrees C, 40% humidity). This study provides a useful strategy for selecting the third component to improve the OPV performance.

TI  - Evolving Trends in Surgical Management of Breast Cancer: An Analysis of 30 Years of Practice Changing Papers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of breast cancer has evolved into a multidisciplinary evidence-based surgical speciality, with emphasis on conservative surgery. A number of landmark trials have established lumpectomy followed by radiation as the standard of care for many patients. The aim of this study is to construct a narrative review of recent developments in the surgical management of breast cancer and how such developments have impacted surgical practice. A comprehensive literature search of Pubmed was conducted. The latest search was performed on October 31(st), 2020. Search terms "breast cancer" were used in combinations with specific key words and Boolean operators relating to surgical management. The reference lists of retrieved articles were comprehensively screened for additional eligible publications. Articles were selected and reviewed based on relevance. We selected publications in the past 10 years but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded previous publications. Review articles and book chapters were also cited to provide reference on details not discussed in the academic literature. This article reviews the current evidence in surgical management of early-stage breast cancer, discusses recent trends in surgical practice for therapeutic and prophylactic procedures and provides commentary on implications and factors associated with these trends.

TI  - Mapping salt marsh along coastal South Carolina using U-Net
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland mapping is often difficult because of the heterogeneous vegetation compositions and associated tidal effects. In this study, we employed the U-Net and developed an adaptive deep learning approach to map statewide salt marshes in estuarine emergent wetlands of South Carolina (SC), USA, from 20 Sentinel-2A&B images. Considering the spatial heterogeneity of the coastal environment, two NOAA National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRs) in SC were examined, the North Inlet-Winyah Bay (NIWB) NERR for model training and the ACE Basin NERR for testing. A high-resolution land cover map in the NIWB was downloaded for the training process. Ground reference points recorded by the NERR, as well as Google Earth were utilized during the accuracy assessment. The highest overall accuracy (90%) was achieved when all scenes with 10 Sentinel bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were included. The time used to train the model was 5 h, while then the statewide classification was performed in 20 min. Low marsh and high marsh distributions were successfully delineated. Compared to the national marsh maps from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), this study refined the land cover details concerning low marsh and high marsh distributions on the SC coast. Owing to the computational power of the U-Net, the seasonality and tide influence on marsh classification were mitigated by using multi-temporal images. With images available, the deep learning approach developed in this study could be easily adopted in other coastal areas.

TI  - Seeking pleasure or growth? The mediating role of happiness motives in the longitudinal relationship between social mobility beliefs and well-being in college students
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging research has suggested that upward social mobility belief (i.e., perceived chance for moving up socioeconomic ladder through personal merits) may influence people's well-being but has not addressed why. This two-wave longitudinal study aimed to explicate the mechanisms by testing the indirect effect of social mobility belief on college students' well-being through motives to pursue hedonia and eudaimonia in daily activities. A total of 906 Chinese college students (mean age = 19.61, SD =1.03) completed two surveys with an interval of one year. Autoregressive path analyses showed significant indirect effects of social mobility belief on life satisfaction, positive affect and meaning in life (but not negative affect) through eudaimonic motives (but not through hedonic motives). Social mobility beliefs at Time 1 predicted increased eudaimonic motives at Time 2, and eudemonic motives at Time 1 predicted increased well-being at Time 2, adjusting for outcomes assessed at Time 1. The current findings highlight the important roles of socioeconomic worldview and happiness motives in explaining outcomes of well-being.

TI  - Terrestrial oil spill mapping using satellite earth observation and machine learning: A case study in South Sudan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial oil spills are a major threat to environmental and human well-being. Rapid, accurate, and remote spatial assessment of oil contamination is critical to implementing countermeasures that prevent potentially lasting ecological damage and irreversible harm to local communities. Satellite remote sensing has been used to support such assessments in inaccessible regions, although mapping small terrestrial oil spills is challenging - partly due to the pixel size of remote sensing systems, but also due to the distinguishability of small oil spill areas from other land cover types. We assessed the usability of freely available Sentinel satellite images to map terrestrial oil spills with machine learning algorithms. Using two test sites in South Sudan, we demonstrated that information from the Sentinel-1 and-2 instruments can be used to map oil spills with more than 90 % classification accuracy. Classification accuracy was significantly increased (>95 %) with the addition of multi temporal information and spatial predictor variables that quantify proximity to oil production infrastructure such as pipelines and oil pads. The mapping of terrestrial oil spills with freely available Sentinel satellite images may thus represent an accurate and efficient means for the regular monitoring of oil-impacted areas.

TI  - Response of supraglacial rivers and lakes to ice flow and surface melt on the northeast Greenland ice sheet during the 2017 melt season
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast ice flow and substantial surface runoff form distinct and extensive supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). These supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage. However, the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified. In this study, we mapped the multi-temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast GrIS (area similar to 3 x 10(4) km(2)) using sixty-five 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer, and quantified their primary hydromorphology, including meltwater area fraction, meltwater volume, supraglacial river length, river sinuosity, river depth, supraglacial lake area, lake shape, and lake depth. The quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model (RCM) runoff. The results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5.3% of the northeast GrIS, which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest GrIS (similar to 7.0%). As the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats, supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin (similar to 400 m) to high elevations (similar to 1400 m). The satellite-mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the RCM surface runoff before the timing of peak melt (August 1), but decreases relatively slowly (by 32-45%) compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff (by 84-96%) in August. Large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume. High (800-1400 m) elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low (400-800 m) elevation bands, and the 800-1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers. Furthermore, the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes. There are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large, narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow. Meanwhile, long, sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice. In general, this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly-studied northeast GrIS and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with patent blue dye in patients with breast cancer: a retrospective single institution study
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since the end of the last century, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as standard of care for axillary staging in early breast cancer in patients without any clinical sign of axillary lymph node infiltration. The worldwide most frequently used mapping method consists in the injection of radioactive Technetium-99 isotope alone or in combination with blue dye. As a specific infrastructure and dedicated personnel are needed for the use of a radioactive tracer, the CHC in Liege (Belgium) decided to test the use of patent blue dye alone to detect sentinel lymph nodes in a large consecutive cohort of patients and compared the results with radioactive mapping methods and guidelines recommendations. Methods: Patent blue dye was used in 456 consecutive patients with early breast cancer who underwent conservative breast cancer surgery or radical mastectomy between 1/1/2000 and 31/12/2007 in a community hospital (CHC Liege, Belgium). After SLNB, an ALND was performed in each patient. Results: Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 444 patients among the 456 patients evaluated by this mapping method during this time period, which represents a detection rate of 97.4%. Infiltrated lymph nodes were detected in 32.7% of patients (149/456) while in the 444 patients with sentinel lymph nodes identified and resected, 137 patients have at last one positive lymph node (30.9%). The false negative rate was 4.9% and the predictive negative value was 97.7% with the blue dye mapping method. Conclusions: In addition of the simplicity of the method and the large economic advantage, SNLB using blue dye alone showed a quite acceptable performance in our retrospective analysis concerning its ability to find the SLN as well as its reliability to remove the good ones.

TI  - Very virulent infectious bursal disease virus infection caused changes in cloacal temperature and clinical manifestations in pigeons (<i>Columba livia domestica</i>) and is transmitted to sentinel chickens
T2  - VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, changes in cloacal temperature and clinical manifestations due to very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) infection in pigeons (Columba livia domestica) and transmission to chickens were demonstrated. Thirty pigeons (3-6 weeks old) and thirty chickens (3 weeks old) divided into 4 groups (I-IV) were used for this study. Group I comprised of 10 uninoculated pigeons only; II comprised of 10 inoculated pigeons and 10 sentinel chickens; III comprised of 10 sentinel pigeons and 10 inoculated chickens, while IV comprised of 10 uninoculated chickens only. Pigeons in group II and chickens in group III were each inoculated with 0.20 mL (titre of 10(9.76)CID(50)/mL) of vvIBDV (Nigerian strain). Cloacal temperature was monitored and clinical manifestations scored post-inoculation (pi). Results indicated significant (P < 0.05) pyrexia at 2 days pi (dpi), mild clinical signs and no mortality in inoculated pigeons. Significant (P < 0.05) pyrexia at 2-4 dpi, severe clinical signs and mortality (50%; 60%) were observed in inoculated and sentinel chickens. IBDV antigen and antibody were detected in pigeons and chickens. Pigeons showed response to vvIBDV infection thus suggesting susceptibility of pigeons to IBD. Sentinel chickens presented clinical manifestations of IBD and this suggests transmission from pigeons to chickens. This study therefore documents pyrexia and clinical manifestations due to vvIBDV infection in pigeons and successful transmission of the virus between pigeons and chickens.

TI  - A new fog and low stratus retrieval for tropical South America reveals widespread fog in lowland forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog-driven epiphyte-rich tropical cloud forests were long believed to be restricted to mountainous regions. Recent studies have shown the occurrence of such forest types in the lowlands of French Guiana, where early morning radiation fog was shown to modify the water and energy cycles at the canopy level of the tropical lowland rain forest (Gehrig-Downie et al., 2012; Obregon et al., 2011). Since this newly discovered Tropical Lowland Cloud Forest (TLCF) harbours a unique biodiversity comparable to mountain cloud forests, knowledge of its spatial distribution across tropical lowland forests is of large ecological interest, but so far fully unknown. A prerequisite to detect potential TLCF stands is knowledge on the spatial occurrence of fog/low stratus clouds (FLS) over longer time scales, indicating fog frequency. We address this need on a continental scale by presenting the first spatially-explicit, high-resolution product on nocturnal FLS occurrence over the entire tropical lowland rain forest area of South America. The product is based on a new FLS retrieval scheme that uses brightness temperature (BT) information of night-time satellite images acquired by the Aqua Moderate Imaging Spectror-adiometer (Aqua MODIS). Since landforms substantially influence small-scale FLS development, we used a dy-namic threshold technique depending on the spatially variable subpixel information on landform suitability for FLS generation. The product was successfully validated against in-situ visibility measurements combined with a plausibility analysis based on the published but scarce fog observations over the Amazon. The independence of the new algorithm from measured total precipitable water (TPW) is an improvement over existing procedures that are limited to the availability of these ancillary data. The FLS frequency map for the entire tropical lowland forest of South America derived from over 52,000 scenes (18 years from 2003 to 2020 inclusive) indicates that FLS is widespread, though spatially differentiated, throughout the tropical lowland forests of South America, providing suitable environmental conditions for the TLCF. This knowledge on the spatial distribution of potential TLCF is of major importance for conservation efforts. The new FLS scheme is applicable to all tropical lowland forests and can therefore support global conservation efforts of the valuable TLCF ecosystems.

TI  - The (other) two percent also matter: The construction of mobile phone refusers
T2  - MOBILE MEDIA & COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Technological resistance practices hold significant insights regarding the media's role as much as its adoption and usage practices. However, studies examining media non-use have generally overlooked mobile phone resisters-individuals voluntarily deciding not to own mobile phones. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with mobile phone refusers, this study presents two refuser types differing in refusal dynamics. The first are ideologists, whose rejection stems from a formulated, critical worldview towards the mobile phone, in particular, and communication technologies, in general. The second are realizers, whose "post-factum resistance" resulted from a forced but positive experience of a temporary break in use (e.g., when their device was broken or stolen), motivating them to disconnect in an attempt to preserve the new, liberated space they experienced. Additional findings reveal the non-ownership practices adopted by the mobile phone refusers; the novel psychological and sociological motives underlying mobile phone refusal concerning the home space and digital well-being; refuser resistance discourse, which focuses solely on the medium's nature and not its content; and how refusers negotiate the social status and stigma that accompanies their mobile phone refusal. Our study illustrates how mobile phone refusal stands apart from other media resistance, providing a deeper perspective on the price of connectivity, and thus underscoring the importance of studying these refusers. The uniqueness of mobile phone refusal is further expressed in its complexity, extremity, perceived authenticity, and visibility.

TI  - Sustainability and creativity through mail art: A case study with young artists in universities
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Universities around the world are making considerable efforts to contribute to sustainable development through their institutional frameworks, education, research or community awareness. This article discusses how young artists connect with sustainability problems through an analysis of individual artistic creativity (visions, sources of inspiration, messages and communicative strategies) by means of a novel interpretive arts-based research methodology: mail art. A collection of mail art individually created by 29 young artists who also provide selfreports on the meaning of their work, the creation process and its intent are analyzed using a qualitative content analysis methodology complemented by an aesthetic inquiry into the artistic qualities and creative techniques of the collection. The research concludes that the collection reproduces but also produces messages promoting a sustainability culture. It promotes individual actions for sustainability with everyday creativity using expert knowledge and describes visions and attitudes expressed by young people to detect gaps and to develop a more informed education for sustainable development in universities. Although there are individual differences, the participants generally show appropriate values -such as universalism-, and a desire for ethical action within an ecocentric worldview, displaying constructive hope. However, the collection stands out for a collective, global and future-oriented, versus individual, local and present-oriented framing, running the risk of becoming visions that can delay transformative actions. Some of the most conclusive recommendations of the study are the need to work on the issues of equity and equality in universities today, to enhance the critical perspective of students and to change their current role from that of merely observers to agents for change.

TI  - Reading for lyric in the African digital litmag
T2  - SOCIAL DYNAMICS-A JOURNAL OF AFRICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article asks what we are reading for when we read poems in African-run literary magazines that are increasingly online. How can we begin to theorise the significance of publication and experience of reading in digital formats? In the wake of a debate in literary studies about lyric reading, the author suggests that reading African poetry in digital litmags gives us an opportunity to rethink how exactly poems are entangled with history - and that reading for lyric involves attending to how a poem might aspire to outlive its initial historical context. Drawing on unpublished sources as well as online and print materials, the article discusses such African-run litmags as Sentinel Poetry (Online), Maple Tree Literary Supplement, Jalada, Saraba and Agbowo. For poets including Ogaga Ifowodo, Tsitsi Jaji, Jumoke Verissimo and Logan February who have chosen to publish in these litmags, political liberation entails reimagining sociality, subjectivity and sexuality. Ultimately, the article argues, their poems should not only be located in the recent past but also recognised as opening up temporalities of recurrence and futurity that show up the limitations of the present.

TI  - Intercomparison of Arctic Sea Ice Backscatter and Ice Type Classification Using Ku-Band and C-Band Scatterometers
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of global warming, multiyear ice (MYI) is being replaced by first-year ice (FYI) in the Arctic. Microwave scatterometers in the Ku-band and C-band can provide daily observations of sea ice type. However, their comparative capabilities in mapping ice type have not been thoroughly evaluated. We present a systematic intercomparison of the backscatter signature in VV polarization ( ${sigma}_{{vv}}<^>{{o}})$ and the sea ice classification from three scatterometer systems using the same ice classification approach. The systems are the Ku-band quick scatterometer (QSCAT) and the newly launched Chinese rotating fan-beam scatterometer (RFSCAT) and the C-band advanced scatterometer (ASCAT). Three freezing seasons are used, i.e., 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the QSCAT/ASCAT comparison and 2019/20 for the RFSCAT/ASCAT comparison. With reference to ASCAT, ${sigma}_{{vv}}<^>{{o}}$ bias between QSCAT and RFSCAT results from their different incidence angles. A continuous declining trend of ${sigma }_{{vv}}<^>{{o}}$ from MYI and FYI is observed during winter, with a greater difference between MYI and FYI in the Ku-band. The MYI and FYI extent derived from QSCAT/RFSCAT is highly consistent with that derived from ASCAT, with a difference less than 7% and 3% for MYI and FYI, respectively. The overall accuracy (OA) is around 77% and 80% for the RFSCAT results and ASCAT results, respectively, compared with Sentinel-1 SAR images. The classification results show high consistency (81%-89%) with ice charts from the Canadian Ice Service. The incorporation of ${{Tb}}_{36{h}}$ from AMSR-E/AMSR2 improves the OA of the classification when using ASCAT or RFSCAT by 7%-11%.

TI  - Towards an open and synergistic framework for mapping global land cover
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land-cover datasets are key sources of information for understanding the complex inter-actions between human activities and global change. They are also among the most critical variables for climate change studies. Over time, the spatial resolution of land cover maps has increased from the kilometer scale to 10-m scale. Single-type historical land cover datasets, including for forests, water, and impervious surfaces, have also been developed in recent years. In this study, we present an open and synergy framework to produce a global land cover dataset that combines supervised land cover classification and aggregation of existing multiple thematic land cover maps with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. On the basis of this method of classification and mosaicking, we derived a global land cover dataset for 6 years over a time span of 25 years. The overall accuracies of the six maps were around 75% and the accuracy for change area detection was over 70%. Our product also showed good similarity with the FAO and existing land cover maps.

TI  - Current Surgical Management of Inflammatory Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive breast cancer characterized by erythema and edema of at least one-third of the breast. The diagnosis remains a clinical one. Standard of care involves trimodality therapy with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy if HER2 positive, followed by modified radical mastectomy and post-mastectomy radiation therapy to the chest wall in addition to regional nodal basins including supraclavicular and internal mammary nodes. Current evidence does not support de-escalation of surgical therapy in the breast and axilla in IBC, and positive surgical margins have been associated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging has a high false negative rate prohibiting its use in IBC. Delayed reconstruction is recommended for IBC due to a high recurrence rate and a potential for delay in adjuvant therapy. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy may be considered at the time of delayed reconstruction. In this paper, we discuss available evidence and controversies in the current surgical management of patients with IBC.

TI  - Seasonal influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction During the 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, limited data from several countries suggested reduced seasonal influenza viruses' circulation. This was due to community mitigation measures implemented to control the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used sentinel surveillance data to identify changes in the 2020 influenza season compared with previous seasons in Bangladesh. Methods We used hospital-based influenza surveillance (HBIS) data of Bangladesh that are generated year-round and are population-representative severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) data for all age groups from seven public and two private tertiary care level hospitals data from 2016 to 2019. We applied the moving epidemic method (MEM) by using R language (v4.0.3), and MEM web applications (v2.14) on influenza-positive rates of SARI cases collected weekly to estimate an average seasonal influenza curve and establish epidemic thresholds. Results The 2016-2019 average season started on epi week 18 (95% CI: 15-25) and lasted 12.5 weeks (95% CI: 12-14 weeks) until week 30.5. The 2020 influenza season started on epi week 36 and ended at epi week 41, lasting for only five weeks. Therefore, influenza epidemic started 18 weeks later, was 7.5 weeks shorter, and was less intense than the average epidemic of the four previous years. The 2020 influenza season started on the same week when COVID-19 control measures were halted, and 13 weeks after the measures were relaxed. Conclusion Our findings suggest that seasonal influenza circulation in Bangladesh was delayed and less intense in 2020 than in previous years. Community mitigation measures may have contributed to this reduction of seasonal influenza transmission. These findings contribute to a limited but growing body of evidence that influenza seasons were altered globally in 2020.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of atmospheric CO2 concentration and controlling factors over sugarcane cultivation areas in southern Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advancement of remote sensing, it is now possible to identify and characterize greenhouse gas emissions under deferment land uses. Given the above, this study aimed to characterize the spatial-temporal variability and the main factors controlling the average atmospheric CO2 column (Xco(2)) in the macroregion of Ribeirao Preto (MRP), Sao Paulo, a significant sugarcane producer in Brazil. We obtained remote sensing data from January 2015 to December 2018. The variables used were Xco(2) and sun-induced fluorescence of chlorophyll (SIF) by NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite (OCO-2), relative humidity (RH), global radiation (Qg), and the average temperature at 2 m (T2m) by the NASA-POWER platform, and leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration by Penman-Monteith (ET) by MODIS sensor. We evaluated the data in trimester's averages, where descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and linear regression have been applied. The spatial distribution was made by the inverse distance weighted (IDW). The minimum (390.40 +/- 0.41 ppm) and maximum (394.75 +/- 0.34 ppm) mean of Xco(2) was observed in the first quarter of 2015 and third quarter of 2017. The Xco2 obtained negative correlations with the SIF (-0.81), LAI (-0.81), RH (-0.74), ET (-0.84), and Qg (-0.51). Hotspots and coldspots of Xco(2) tend to vary over the years. We conclude that the temporal variation of Xco(2) above sugarcane areas in southern Brazil is well represented by a periodic function. Our results indicate photosynthesis and soil exposure after harvest are factors that could act as source and sink of CO2.

TI  - Disaster damage assessment based on fine-grained topics in social media
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media data have been widely used to enrich human-centric information for situational awareness and disaster assessment. Owing to the granularity of topics detected from disaster-related contents, the effectiveness of social media in reflecting disaster losses is still limited. To address this limitation, this study developed a methodology for assessing disaster losses using social media data, which was composed of data preprocessing, fine-grained topic extraction, and quantitative damage estimation. The proposed methodology was demonstrated in a case study of Typhoons Hato & Pakhar, which caused persistent damage in southern China from August 22 to August 30, 2017. The results highlighted the capability of the proposed methodology in using fine-grained topics to assess disaster losses, e.g., the disaster losses were significantly correlated with infrastructure damage-related topics. The study provided useful insights in disaster damage assessment through the fine-grained topics in social media.

TI  - Modelling lake water's surface changes using environmental and remote sensing data: A case study of lake urmia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A synthesis approach known as modeling lake water changes model (LWC-model) was proposed in this research for assessing, conserving, and managing the water stability of lakes. The proposed LWC model was divided into two parts: assessment of satellite-derived water feature and spatiotemporal modelling. The LWC model was empirically evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat data, environmental criteria, and Urmia lake restoration programs (ULRP) criteria, and the results were compared to its stable situation (i.e., 2002). Initially, several water indices were studied for extracting surface water. Following that, one of these indices that outperformed the others when compared to the reference map was employed in the suggested method. Second, three economic strategies were used to examine the environmental and government ULRP requirements. The first part's findings revealed a significant reduction in lake water surface of about 58.22% between 2002 and 2014, followed by a 37% rise between 2014 and 2018. These gradual variations in water level may be ascribed to two primary criteria: the ULRP requirements for Lake Urmia resurrection and environmental variables. This stability would be somewhat fragile if ULRP recovery operations on the lake were not undertaken due to the generally steady climatic conditions. Furthermore, the findings of the three strategies revealed that the lowest, average, and maximum time necessary for Lake Urmia to return to a stable state, were 10, 20, and 39 years, respectively. The LWC model used a versatile method that could be applied to any body of water given the new criteria and parameters. To summarize, the approach we presented can be suggested for modeling and mapping inland water, specifically lake water fluctuations in other favorable areas with comparable meteorological and environmental circumstances.

TI  - A multi-source 120-year US flood database with a unified common format and public access
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite several flood databases available in the United States, there is a benefit to combine and reconcile these diverse data sources into a comprehensive flood database with a unified common format and easy public access in order to facilitate flood-related research and applications. Typically, floods are reported by specialists or media according to their socioeconomic impacts. Recently, data-driven analysis can reconstruct flood events based on in situ and/or remote-sensing data. Lately, with the increasing engagement of citizen scientists, there is the potential to enhance flood reporting in near-real time. The central objective of this study is to integrate information from seven popular multi-sourced flood databases into a comprehensive flood database in the United States, made readily available to the public in a common data format. Natural language processing, geocoding, and harmonizing processing steps are undertaken to facilitate such development. In total, there are 698 507 flood records in the United States from 1900 to the present, which highlights the longest and most comprehensive recording of flooding across the country. The database features event locations, durations, date/times, socioeconomic impacts (e.g., fatalities and economic damages), and geographic information (e.g., elevation, slope, contributing area, and land cover types retrieved from ancillary data for given flood locations). Finally, this study utilizes the flood database to analyze flood seasonality within major basins and socioeconomic impacts over time. It is anticipated that thus far the most comprehensive yet unified database can support a variety of flood-related research, such as a validation resource for hydrologic or hydraulic simulations, hydroclimatic studies concerning spatiotemporal patterns of floods, and flood susceptibility analysis for vulnerable geophysical locations. The dataset is publicly available with the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4547036 (Li, 2020).

TI  - Outcomes of Stage I and II Breast Cancer with Nodal Micrometastases Treated with Mastectomy without Axillary Therapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Studies that report equivalent oncologic outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for T1-2N1mi breast cancers are heavily weighted with patients who received breast-conserving surgery (BCS). The impact of omitting ALND in N1mi patients treated with mastectomy is not well studied. It is also unknown if these patients would benefit from post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). This study reports the outcomes of patients with T1-2N1mi breast cancer treated by mastectomy without axillary therapy. Methods Patients who had T1-2N1mi breast cancer and underwent mastectomy from January 1998 to December 2018 were identified from our multi-institutional prospective database. Axillary recurrence rate (ARR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) are reported. Results 260 patients with pT1-2N1mi breast cancer who had mastectomy were identified. They had either SLNB (35.4%) or ALND (64.6%). Majority of these patients received adjuvant systemic therapy (93.8%). 77 (29.6%) patients received radiotherapy, 31 after SLNB and 46 after ALND. At median follow-up of 61 months, ARR was 1.1% (n = 1) in the SLNB only group, vs. 0.6% (n = 1) in the ALND group (p = 0.752). DFS and OS were not significantly different between patients with SLNB alone versus ALND (p = 0.40 and p = 0.27, respectively). Among 92 patients who had SLNB only, no DFS or OS difference was observed with the use of PMRT. Conclusion In T1-2N1mi patients with mastectomy and SLNB, axillary recurrences were rare. No statistically significant differences were noted between patients with SLNB, ALND, or PMRT. Our findings suggest that these patients may be safely treated without axillary therapy.

TI  - Evolution of the hydro-ecological environment and its natural and anthropogenic causes during 1985-2019 in the Nenjiang River basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and vegetation are important components of the hydro-ecological environment and sensitive indicators of anthropogenic climate change and human activities. For the first time, the lake area, vegetation cover change (obtained from Landsat satellite images), terrestrial water storage (TWS; estimated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment), and hydrochemistry, stable isotopes of different waterbodies were combined to analyze the long-term evolution and controlling factors of lake area and vegetation cover in the Nenjiang River basin, China. Between 1985 and 1999, the lake area experienced natural shrinkage due to climatic and hydrological changes, whereas artificial shrinkage related to increased human activities dominated during 2000-2019. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased during 1988-1999 and was affected by hydrometeorological factors in the same year and lake area in the previous year. The rate of increase in the NDVI accelerated during 2000-2012 owing to the impact of human activities which is reflected by GDP, and the related artificial shrinkage of the lake area. The main hydrochemical type of lake water changed from Ca-HCO3 before 2000, which was similar to that of river water, to Na-HCO3 after 2000, which was the main hydrochemical type of groundwater. In addition, most of the lake water and groundwater samples were rich in H2SiO3, and a strong correlation between the TWS and lake area for the period 2003-2019 indicated that lake water was strongly affected by groundwater, which was related to deep circulation. Therefore, the decreased river water recharge owing to human activities made groundwater contribute more to lakewater. This study can substantially improve the decision-making support for environmental protection and water resource management in ecologically diverse areas, specifically in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Record winter winds in 2020/21 drove exceptional Arctic sea ice transport
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The volume of Arctic sea ice is in decline but exhibits high interannual variability, which is driven primarily by atmospheric circulation. Through analysis of satellite-derived ice products and atmospheric reanalysis data, we show that winter 2020/21 was characterised by anomalously high sea-level pressure over the central Arctic Ocean, which resulted in unprecedented anticyclonic winds over the sea ice. This atmospheric circulation pattern drove older sea ice from the central Arctic Ocean into the lower-latitude Beaufort Sea, where it is more vulnerable to melting in the coming warm season. We suggest that this unusual atmospheric circulation may potentially lead to unusually high summer losses of the Arctic's remaining store of old ice. In the winter 2020-2021, unusual winds pushed old sea ice from the central Arctic Ocean to lower latitudes, where the ice may melt more easily in the coming warm season, suggests an analysis of sea ice satellite data and ERA5 reanalysis data.

TI  - Mapping phosphorus concentration in Mediterranean forests using different remote-sensing methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral nutrition is essential for optimal plant growth. Phosphorus (P) is a relatively small component of leaf dry weight, with a concentration in plant foliage of less than 1%. Despite its low concentration, P is an essential element in plants, mainly used for energy transfer. Mapping P concentration using traditional methods is expensive and usually limited to a small area; it is time-consuming and covers only a few plant individuals or species. In this study, we demonstrate the use of remote-sensing (RS) data acquired from the feld and airborne hyperspectral sensors to predict and map the P concentration in leaves of different woody Mediterranean plant species. Comprehensive field work included leaf sampling, laboratory analyses, and spectral measurements using a visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR) field spectrometer. Using different spectral configurations, we built accurate models to predict P concentration in leaf samples. The models were built using a NIR data analysis technique with the data mining software PARACUDA II. This software allowed us to identify the correlative wavelengths for P-bearing molecules in selected woody Mediterranean plant species. The hyperspectral-based model for leaf P concentration was extracted from the reflectance data acquired using a manned aircraft carrying a hyperspectral sensor (Specim AisaFenix 1 K). The model gave a reliable correlation between points extracted from the hyperspectral image and samples measured in the field. We believe that the methodology used in this study will help forest ecologists better understand the concentration of P in the foliage of woody Mediterranean plant species.

TI  - Twenty years of change: Land and water resources in the Chindwin catchment, Myanmar between 1999 and 2019
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2011, Myanmar has undergone a more rapid socio-economic development, which may substantially have affected land use and land cover (LULC) and water resources. This study investigates the changes in land and water resources of the Chindwin River catchment (114,686.9 km(2)) in Myanmar over a twenty-year timespan from 1999 to 2019. The main aim of this study is to assess LULC change and evaluate its effects on the water balance and the people in the region. To this end, interviews were conducted, LULC classifications based on multitemporal multi-spectral satellite data and in-situ ground truth data were created, and a hydrologic model was built. The hydrologic model shows a reasonable performance for daily discharge simulation at the catchment outlet (percent bias between -2 and 13.2, Kling-Gupta Efficiency between 0.75 and 0.76, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency between 0.57 and 0.61, RMSE-observations standard deviation between 0.63 and 0.66). The LULC changes detected include a decrease in forest area of about 2%, an increase in shrubland area indicating increased degradation of the forest an increase in mining areas of 0.38%, an overall decrease in agricultural area (2.1%), but also the presence of new agricultural land pointing toward relocation of agricultural areas and an indication of an increase in settlement areas (1.5%). With the help of the hydrologic model, the most significant hydrologic impacts detected were a decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in water yield which is correlated with the decrease of forest at the sub-catchment scale (R-2 = 0.72 and 0.46, respectively). Moreover, an increase of mining areas contributed to the increase in water yield (R-2 = 0.62). Interviews confirm that the identified LULC changes deforestation and increased mining activities contribute to major issues, e.g., water pollution, sedimentation, and changes in the river course.

TI  - An integrated approach of field, weather, and satellite data for monitoring maize phenology
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient, more accurate reporting of maize (Zea mays L.) phenology, crop condition, and progress is crucial for agronomists and policy makers. Integration of satellite imagery with machine learning models has shown great potential to improve crop classification and facilitate in-season phenological reports. However, crop phenology classification precision must be substantially improved to transform data into actionable management decisions for farmers and agronomists. An integrated approach utilizing ground truth field data for maize crop phenology (2013-2018 seasons), satellite imagery (Landsat 8), and weather data was explored with the following objectives: (i) model training and validation-identify the best combination of spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), weather parameters, geolocation, and ground truth data, resulting in a model with the highest accuracy across years at each season segment (step one) and (ii) model testing-post-selection model performance evaluation for each phenology class with unseen data (hold-out cross-validation) (step two). The best model performance for classifying maize phenology was documented when VIs (NDVI, EVI, GCVI, NDWI, GVMI) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were used as input variables. This study supports the integration of field ground truth, satellite imagery, and weather data to classify maize crop phenology, thereby facilitating foundational decision making and agricultural interventions for the different members of the agricultural chain.

TI  - Skin adnexal carcinoma with <i>BRD3-NUTM2B</i> fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - NUT carcinomas are genetically defined epithelial neoplasms. Most tumors harbor fusions of NUTM1 with BRD4 or BRD3. Their histopathologic features have been predominantly reported as undifferentiated or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and clinically they tend to be aggressive cancers. However, recent studies have revealed a broader spectrum of NUTM1-rearranged neoplasms with several new fusion partners and associated variable histopathologic phenotypes and clinical behaviors, including benign and malignant cutaneous poroid tumors. We report herein a primary invasive carcinoma of skin adnexal origin with a previously undescribed fusion between BRD3 and NUTM2B. The tumor occurred on the shoulder of a 7-year-old girl and was excised with negative margins. A sentinel lymph node was positive. After follow-up of 23 months, and without systemic treatment, the child remains free of tumor. This case expands the spectrum of NUT carcinomas by including a skin adnexal variant with follicular infundibular differentiation, a novel genomic aberration, and preliminary evidence of a less aggressive clinical course.

TI  - Spatial and temporal subsidence characteristics in Wuhan (China), during 2015-2019, inferred from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence is regarded as one of the most common geohazards, accompanied with the rapid urban expansion in recent years. In the last 2 decades, Wuhan, located in the alluvial Jianghan Plain, has experienced great urban expansion with increased subsidence issues, i.e., soft foundation subsidence and karst collapse. Here we investigated subsidence rates in Wuhan with 2015-2019 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We found that the overall subsidence over the Wuhan region is significantly correlated with the distribution of engineering geological subregions (EGSs). We further validated the interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements with better than 5mm accuracy by comparing with leveling measurements. Subsidence centers in Qingling-Jiangdi, Houhu, Qingshan, and Dongxihu were identified with displacement rates of approximately 30 mm/yr. Our results demonstrated that the dominant driving factor is ongoing construction, and the fact that the subsidence centers shifted with construction intensities. The Qingling-Jiangdi area in our study is a well-known site of karst collapse. We find that the nonlinear subsidence of this area is correlated with the seasonal rainfall.

TI  - Decreased human respiratory syncytial virus activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: an ecological time-series analysis
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as sanitary measures and travel restrictions, aimed at controlling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may affect the transmission dynamics of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). We aimed to quantify the contribution of the sales of hand hygiene products and the number of international and domestic airline passenger arrivals on HRSV epidemic in Japan.MethodsThe monthly number of HRSV cases per sentinel site (HRSV activity) in 2020 was compared with the average of the corresponding period in the previous 6years (from January 2014 to December 2020) using a monthly paired t-test. A generalized linear gamma regression model was used to regress the time-series of the monthly HRSV activity against NPI indicators, including sale of hand hygiene products and the number of domestic and international airline passengers, while controlling for meteorological conditions (monthly average temperature and relative humidity) and seasonal variations between years (2014-2020).ResultsThe average number of monthly HRSV case notifications in 2020 decreased by approximately 85% (p<0.001) compared to those in the preceding 6years (2014-2019). For every average yen1 billion (approximately 680,000/$9,000,000) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1month before there was a 0.29% (p=0.003) decrease in HRSV infections. An increase of average 1000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1-2months was associated with a 3.8x10(-4)% (p<0.001) and 1.2x10(-3)% (p<0.001) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively.Conclusions This study suggests that there is an association between the decrease in the monthly number of HRSV cases and improved hygiene and sanitary measures and travel restrictions for COVID-19 in Japan, indicating that these public health interventions can contribute to the suppression of HRSV activity. These findings may help in public health policy and decision making.

TI  - Iterative near-infrared atmospheric correction scheme for global coastal waters
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction (AC) is a key step in ocean color remote sensing for obtaining oceanic and coastal water ecosystem products. However, traditional NIR-based AC scheme (AC(NIR)) often fails in turbid coastal waters dominated by high suspended particulate matter (SPM). SWIR-based AC is valid for turbid waters, but it cannot be applied to some satellite sensors (e.g., Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and future small satellite sensors) that have no SWIR bands. To obtain reliable data of turbid coastal waters by these sensors without SWIR bands, an improved AC(NIR) (AC(NIR-PRO)) scheme is proposed herein based on the frame of traditional AC(NIR) (AC(NIR-STA)). The synthesized and in situ datasets are analyzed to extend bio-optical models of absorption and backscattering coefficients in AC(NIR-STA) to highly turbid waters. AC(NIR-PRO) utilizes concentrations of both chlorophyll-a ([Chla]) and SPM ([SPM]) to estimate water-leaving contributions at the NIR bands. Similar to NIR-SWIR AC, AC(NIR-PRO) can obtain the information of global coastal waters with remote sensing reflectance at 862 nm (R-rs(862)) up to 0.025 similar to 0.03 sr(-1). R-rs of AC(NIR-PRO) is also validated by AERONET-OC datasets (mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) of R-rs (551) is approximately 16%) for various coastal waters including high colored dissolved organic matter. Further, the magnitude and spatial patterns of [SPM] and [Chla] derived from the R-rs products after performing AC(NIR-PRO) are significantly better than those from AC(NIR-STA), especially for turbid coastal waters.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation Based on Temporal Features: Learning of Temporal-Spatial Information From Time-Series SAR Images for Paddy Rice Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to obtain remote sensing images of different growth stages of crops under all weather conditions. Such time-series SAR images can provide an abundance of temporal and spatial features for use in large-scale crop mapping and analysis. In this study, we propose a temporal feature-based segmentation (TFBS) model for accurate crop mapping using time-series SAR images. This model first extracts deep-seated temporal features and then learns the spatial context of the extracted temporal features for crop mapping. The results indicate that the TFBS model significantly outperforms traditional long short-term memory (LSTM), U-network, and convolutional LSTM models in crop mapping based on time-series SAR images. TFBS demonstrates better generalizability than other models in the study area, which makes it more transferable, and the results show that data augmentation can significantly improve this generalizability. The visualization of the temporal features extracted by the TFBS shows that there is a high degree of intraclass homogeneity among rice fields and interclass heterogeneity between rice fields and other features. TFBS also achieved the highest accuracy of the four deep learning models for multicrop classification in the study area. This study presents a feasible way of producing high-accuracy large-scale crop maps based on the proposed model.

TI  - A clustering method for inter-annual NDVI time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series has been applied to change detection in many fields. Research on change detection in inter-annual NDVI time series always requires several related parameters or sample training, which may limit the transferability of the methods to some extent. In this letter, we try to develop a shape-based clustering to analyse the inter-annual NDVI time series by considering the shapes of time series. The method adopts shape-based distance based on cross-correlation analysis to measure the distance between time series and uses shape-based averaging method named Dynamic Time Warping Barycentre Averaging to get the cluster centroids. Through experimental analysis, the shape-based clustering can well gather the NDVI time series with similar trends into a cluster. Also, the shape-based clustering is proven to be reliable with 94.4% overall accuracy for detection of vegetation disturbance.

TI  - Exocyst protein subnetworks integrate Hippo and mTOR signaling to promote virus detection and cancer
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that regulates vesicular trafficking and scaffolds signal transduction. Key upstream components of the exocyst include monomeric RAL GTPases, which help mount cell-autonomous responses to trophic and immunogenic signals. Here, we present a quantitative proteomics-based characterization of dynamic and signal-dependent exocyst protein interactomes. Under viral infection, an Exo84 exocyst subcomplex assembles the immune kinase Protein Kinase R (PKR) together with the Hippo kinase Macrophage Stimulating 1 (MST1). PKR phosphorylates MST1 to activate Hippo signaling and inactivate Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1). By contrast, a Sec5 exocyst subcomplex recruits another immune kinase, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which interacted with and activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). RALB was necessary and sufficient for induction of Hippo and mTOR signaling through parallel exocyst subcomplex engagement, supporting the cellular response to virus infection and oncogenic signaling. This study highlights RALB-exocyst signaling subcomplexes as mechanisms for the integrated engagement of Hippo and mTOR signaling in cells challenged by viral pathogens or oncogenic signaling.

TI  - Live fuel moisture content estimation from MODIS: A deep learning approach
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an essential variable to model fire danger and behaviour. This paper presents the first application of deep learning to LFMC estimation based on the historical LFMC ground samples of the Globe-LFMC database, as a step towards operational daily LFMC mapping in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). One-year MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series preceding each LFMC sample were extracted as the primary data source for training. The proposed temporal convolutional neural network for LFMC (TempCNN-LFMC) comprises three 1-D convolutional layers that learn the multi-scale temporal dynamics (features) of one-year MODIS time series specific to LFMC estimation. The learned features, together with a few auxiliary variables (e.g., digital elevation model), are then passed to three fully connected layers to extract the non-linear relationships with LFMC. In the primary training and validation scenario, the neural network was trained using samples from 2002 to 2013 and then adopted to estimating the LFMC from 2014 to 2018, achieving an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 25.57% and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.74. Good consistency on spatial patterns and temporal trends of accuracy was observed. The trained model achieved a similar RMSE of 25.98%, 25.20% and 25.93% for forest, shrubland, and grassland, respectively, without requiring prior information on the vegetation type.

TI  - Recent advances in the remote sensing of alpine snow: a review
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Seasonal alpine snow contributes significantly to the water resource. It plays a crucial role in regulating the environmental feedback and from the perspective of socio-economic sustainability in the alpine regions. While most nations are pursuing renewable energy sources, hydropower generated from snowmelt runoff is one of the primary sources. Additionally, alpine regions with snow cover are major tourist destinations that are often affected by natural disasters such as avalanches. The snowmelt runoff and early avalanche warning require timely information on the spatio-temporal aspects of the snow geophysical parameters. In this regard, advances in remote sensing of snow have been observed to be significant. Recent developments in remote sensing technology in the visible, infrared, and microwave spectrum have significantly improved our understanding of snow geophysical processes. This paper provides a review concerning the qualitative and quantitative studies of alpine snow. The electromagnetic characteristics of the alpine snow are largely dependent upon its inherent geophysical structure and the properties of the snow. Snow behaves differently with respect to the wavelength of the incident radiation. In this paper, we provide a categorical review of the remote sensing techniques for estimating the snow geophysical properties, inclusive of permittivity, density, and wetness corresponding to the wavelength used in the remotely sensed data: (1) visible-infrared spectrum including multispectral/hyperspectral, (2) active and passive microwave spectrums. We also discuss the recent advancements in the remote sensing techniques for approximating the volumetric snowpack parameters such as the snow depth and the snow water equivalent based on active and passive microwave remote sensing. This review further discusses the limitations of the techniques reviewed and future prospects for the retrieval of snow geophysical parameters (SGP) corresponding to the recent progress in remote sensing technology. In summary, the recent advances have laid down a foundation for rigorous assessment of seasonal snow using spaceborne remote sensing, particularly at a regional scale. Yet, the scope for improvements in the methods and payload design exists.

TI  - The Relationship Between Yoga and Spirituality: A Systematic Review of Empirical Research
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Both yoga practice and spirituality are associated with beneficial mental health outcomes. Within yoga research, however, spirituality is still a widely neglected area. The present systematic review aims to explore empirical studies, which do, in fact, investigate the relationship between yoga and spirituality in order to provide an overview and future directions for research on this topic. The review examines whether available empirical research supports an association between yoga practice and spirituality and, if so, which specific aspects of spirituality are associated with yoga practice.Methods: The systematic review followed the PRISMA guideline (Prospero registration number: CRD42020155043). Empirical studies written in English, German, or Hungarian language were selected from a database search in Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Science Direct. A total of 30 studies met the final inclusion criteria.Results: According to the quantitative and qualitative studies reviewed, yoga practice seems to be positively associated with spirituality. This association concerns various aspects of spirituality, such as spiritual aspirations, a search for insight/wisdom, an integrative worldview, a sense of meaning and peace, faith, hope, compassion, and happiness within. To harness the potential spiritual benefits of yoga, regular practice appears to be essential. Yoga practitioners seem to have both physical and spiritual motives for practicing. At least in Western societies, however, physical intentions are more prevalent than spiritual ones. The meaning of spirituality for yoga practitioners is also discussed. Due to risk of bias of the majority of the reviewed studies, however, outcomes must be taken with caution.Conclusion: Yoga practice may be positively associated with several aspects of spirituality. For more evidence, further investigation of the topic is suggested. Particularly, we propose the inclusion of holistic forms of yoga practice and a comparison of Eastern and Western approaches to yoga.

TI  - A Time Series Analysis of Forest Cover and Land Surface Temperature Change Over Dudpukuria-Dhopachari Wildlife Sanctuary Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change is an important criterion as it affects the environmental balance whereas land surface temperature is a significant parameter within the earth climate system. Spatio-temporal change of forest cover can be detected and land surface temperature can be retrieved by applying remote sensing technology. The present study aimed to capture the impact of forest cover change on land surface temperature in Dudpukuria-Dhopachari Wildlife Sanctuary (DDWS), Bangladesh, using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite data. To avoid the biasness in the calculation, leaf flash time was targeted for collecting Landsat images from United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer and, based on availability, images were collected purposively which ones had closer time period:1990 (March 5, 1990), 2000 (February 5, 2000), 2010 (February 24, 2010) and 2020 (March 23, 2020). Unsupervised classification was applied over the images Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM C), and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data for detecting forest cover change. To retrieve the land surface temperature, Mono Window Algorithm (MWA) method was applied over similar images. Maximum forest degradation was observed in 2010 and the change found was 17% as compared to 1990. After 2010, the forest started to flourish. Land surface temperature dramatically changes over the time period. The highest land surface temperature in the forested area was observed in 2020 (32.2 degrees C) and it was changed 7.7 degrees C from that of the 1990 (24.5 degrees C). In every 10 years, almost 2.3 degrees C-3.0 degrees C temperature change was detected. In the first three decades, a reverse relationship was observed between land surface temperature and forest cover; however, in the last decade, land surface temperature was found to increase with the increase of forest cover. Thus, the results of the study revealed that land surface temperature may not be relevant with the local forest cover change directly. It can be estimated from the results that local forest cover change may have limited impact on local temperature rather than global forest cover change, whereas global warming could play a vital role in changing land surface temperature locally as well as globally.

TI  - A novel viewpoint to the green city concept based on vegetation area changes and contributions to healthy days: a case study of Mashhad, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the significant challenges in urbanization is the air pollution. This highlights the need of the green city concept with reconsideration of houses, factories, and traffic in a green viewpoint. The literature review confirms that this reconsideration for green space has a positive effect on the air quality of large cities and to reduce the air pollution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the annual vegetation changes in the green space of Mashhad, Iran as a very populated city in the middle east to study the air pollution. To investigate the relationship between the air pollution and vegetation, the Landsat 8 satellite images for summer seasons of 2013-2019 were used to extract changes in vegetation by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). The main contribution in comparison with the relevant studies is to study the relationship between clean, healthy, and unhealthy days with the green space area for the first time in Mashhad, Iran. The results show that the implementation of green city concept in Mashhad, Iran, has been increased by 64, 81, and 53% by NDVI, EVI, and OSAVI, respectively, during the study period. The vegetation area of this city is positively correlated to clean and healthy days and has a negative correlation to unhealthy days, in which the greatest values for NDVI, EVI and OSAVI are 0.33, 0.52, and -0.53, respectively.

TI  - Avoiding burning practice and its consequences on the greenhouse gas emission in sugarcane areas southern Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need of sustainable solutions for balancing agricultural production with the reduction of its environmental impacts. The rapid increase in sugarcane cultivation and the progressive conversion of pre-harvest burning (BH) to green harvest (GH) have brought into debate the contribution of agricultural sector to the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. This study focused on the estimated GHG emission from sugarcane cultivation during years in which sugarcane areas in southern Brazil expanded and passed throughout an important transition, from 2006 to 2012, when harvest adopted was changed from burned to not-burned based. Sugarcane management and harvest were mapped through visual interpretation of Landsat-type satellite images, and the areas under sugarcane cultivation were distinguished according to each agricultural phase and harvest regime (i.e., manual harvest with burning vs. green mechanized harvest). Based on a broad data review and applying the IPCC (2006) methodologies, the results were expressed in terms of kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO(2)eq ha(-1)). Avoiding burn prior to harvest, even during expansion of sugarcane areas, promoted a mean reduction of GHG emission from 901 to 686 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) relative to harvest phase (24% lower) and an increase from 1418.3 to 1507.9 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) related to the ratoon maintenance phase (6% higher). Analyzing the total GHG emission per unit of cultivated sugarcane area (hectare), it was observed a decrease from 2275 to 2034 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) (11% reduction). The gradual transition of pre-harvest burning on that period has contributed to the reduction of GHG emission associated with sugarcane production being an important step towards GHG mitigation while still providing more sustainable sugar and ethanol production in southern Brazil.

TI  - Cotton Yield Estimation Using Phenological Metrics Derived from Long-Term MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology plays a vital role in crop productivity and has been emphasized as the key indicator of crop growth stages. Time-series 16 day composite of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 2011 to 2018 were quantified to study the spatiotemporal and inter-annual changes in crop phenology with smoothening of NDVI curve by Savitzky-Golay filtering method to drive phenological metrics and predict the yield of cotton for the part of Maharashtra state. Two dates of Landsat-8 datasets with supervised classification-based maximum-likelihood classifier were used to generate crop inventory map. The overall accuracy of the map was 89.1% with a 0.79 kappa coefficient and further used in the generation of cotton crop mask. A correlation was established between cotton yield and the phenological metrics. A multiple regression model constructed with phenological metrics from the year 2011-2016 produced a correlation with 0.85 adjusted R-2, 46.97 standard estimated error, 10(-6)p value. The fitted model was used to estimate the cotton yield of 2016-2018 with 82.29 kg ha(-1) root mean square error, 36.13% mean absolute percentage error, and 0.81 Index of Agreement. The results have shown the potential of the model in capturing the variation in the sowing time, end of the crop season, length of growing period, peak NDVI time, peak NDVI value and amplitude in spatiotemporal scale for drought and normal years on a long-term basis.

TI  - In the Christian Archives: Sacrifice, the Higher Criticism, and the History of Religion
T2  - MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Much recent scholarship has shown just how indebted the secular sciences of religion were to the Protestant world from which they grew. Yet this "Protestant world" is typically described schematically, as if Protestantism offered a coherent worldview or even a consistent set of doctrines. A different picture emerges if we deepen our historical horizon, and explore the reflexes, aspirations, and norms that have found a home in the Christian (in this case, Protestant) theological imagination. This "Christian archive" was a heterogeneous place, with room for many things that we would now call secular or even profane. Protestant reform in fact began by condemning this heterogeneity, insisting that much of what the church had come to see was sacred was, at best, only and all too human. Yet centuries of conflict in Europe over the truth of Christianity only pluralized this archive further. The nineteenth-century history of religion grew less out of "Protestantism," in other words, than out of the sedimented mixture of theological, historical, philological, and anthropological materials inherited from these earlier moments. It was, moreover, also an intellectual project that discovered new uses for these materials and thereby opened new horizons of humanistic inquiry. This article makes this argument with reference to sacrifice-a theological challenge for Christian thinkers from the outset of the tradition, but especially for Protestants; a magnet for diverse historical, anthropological, and theological reflections; and a productive zone of inquiry for the nineteenth-century German philosophers, philologians, and "higher critics" of the Hebrew Bible who together helped create the modern history of religion.

TI  - Effects of ozone and particulate matter on airway epithelial barrier structure and function: a review of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies
T2  - INHALATION TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The airway epithelium represents a crucial line of defense against the spread of inhaled pathogens. As the epithelium is the first part of the body to be exposed to the inhaled environment, it must act as both a barrier to and sentinel against any inhaled agents. Despite its vital role in limiting the spread of inhaled pathogens, the airway epithelium is also regularly exposed to air pollutants which disrupt its normal function. Here we review the current understanding of the structure and composition of the airway epithelial barrier, as well as the impact of inhaled pollutants, including the reactive gas ozone and particulate matter, on epithelial function. We discuss the current in vitro, rodent model, and human exposure findings surrounding the impact of various inhaled pollutants on epithelial barrier function, mucus production, and mucociliary clearance. Detailed information on how inhaled pollutants impact epithelial structure and function will further our understanding of the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure.

TI  - Laparoscopic and Robotic Surgery for Endometrial and Cervical Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has many benefits, in the form of reduced postoperative morbidity, improved recovery and reduced inpatient stay. It is imperative, however, when new techniques are adopted, in the context of treating oncology patients, that the oncological efficacy and safety are established rigorously rather than assumed based on first principles. Here we have attempted to provide a comprehensive review of all the contentious and topical themes surrounding the use of MIS in the treatment of endometrial and cervix cancer following a thorough review of the literature. On the topic of endometrial cancer, we cover the role of laparoscopy in both early and advanced disease, together with the role and unique benefits of robotic surgery. The surgical challenge of patients with a raised body mass index and the frail and elderly are discussed and finally the role of sentinel lymph node assessment. For cervical cancer, the role of MIS for staging and primary treatment is covered, together with the interesting and highly specialist topics of fertility-sparing treatment, ovarian transposition and the live birth rate associated with this. We end with a discussion on the evidence surrounding the role of adjuvant hysterectomy following radical chemoradiation and pelvic exenteration for recurrent cervical cancer. MIS is the standard of care for endometrial cancer. The future of MIS for cervix cancer, however, remains uncertain. Current recommendations, based on the available evidence, are that the open approach should be considered the gold standard for the surgical management of early cervical cancer and that MIS should only be adopted in the context of research. Careful counselling of patients on the current evidence, discussing in detail the risks and benefits to enable them to make an informed choice, remains paramount.

TI  - A full-coverage estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations using a hybrid XGBoost-WD model and WRF-simulated meteorological fields in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of the state-of-the-art performances of machine learning in the PM2.5 estimation, the high-value PM2.5 underestimation and non-random aerosol optical depth (AOD) missing are still huge obstacles. By incorporating wavelet decomposition (WD) into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a hybrid XGBoost-WD model was established to obtain the full-coverage PM2.5 estimation at 3-km spatial resolution in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). In this study, 3-km-resolution meteorological fields simulated by WRF along with AOD derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were served as explanatory variables. Model MW and Model NW were developed using XGBoost-WD for the areas with and without AOD respectively to obtain a full-coverage PM2.5 mapping in the YRDUA. The XGBoost-WD model showed good performances in estimating PM2.5 with R2 of 0.80 in the Model MW and 0.87 in the Model NW. Moreover, the Kvalue of Model MW increased from 0.77 to 0.79 and that of Model NM increased from 0.81 to 0.86 compared with the model without the step of WD, indicating an improvement on the problem of PM2.5 underestimation. Due to a better ability of capturing abrupt changes in the PM2.5 concentrations, the spatial evolution of PM2.5 during a typical pollution event could be mapped more accurately. Finally, the analysis of variable importance showed that the three most important variables in the estimation of the low-frequency coefficients of PM2.5 (PM2.5_A4) were temperature at 2 m (T2), day of year (DOY) and longitude (LON), while that in the highfrequency coefficients of PM2.5 (PM2.5_D) were CO, AOD and NO2. This study not only provided an effective solution to the PM2.5 underestimation and AOD missing problems in the PM2.5 estimation, but also proposed a new method to further refine the sophisticated correlations between PM2.5 and some spatiotemporal variables.

TI  - Remote Sensing Inversion for Simulation of Soil Salinization Based on Hyperspectral Data and Ground Analysis in Yinchuan, China
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pingluo area, as an experimental study area in Yinchuan, has been subjected to major environmental degradation due to soil salinization problems. Soil salinization is one of the main problems of land degradation in arid and semiarid regions. In the present study, remote sensing was integrated with mathematical modeling to evaluate soil salinization adequately. To detect soil salinization, soil water content and electrical conductivity of soil samples were analyzed. The reflectance of soil samples was measured using a spectrometer (SR-3500) with 1024 bands. Indices of soil salinity, vegetation and drought were analyzed using Landsat images over the study area. Based on Landsat images, physicochemical analysis, reflectance of sensitive bands for soil salinization and environmental indices, canopy response salinity index (CRSI), perpendicular drought index (PDI) and enhanced normalized difference vegetation index (ENDVI), a new model was established for simulation and prediction of soil salinization in the study area. Correlation analyses and multiple regression methods were used to construct an accurate model. The results showed that green, blue and near-infrared light was significantly correlated with soil salinity and that the spectral parameters improved this correlation significantly. Therefore, the model was more effective when combining spectral parameters with sensitive bands with modeling. After mathematical transformation of soil reflectance, the correlations of bands sensitive to soil salinization were 0.739 and 0.7 for electrical conductivity and water content, respectively. After transformation of vegetation reflectance, the correlation coefficient of soil salinity became 0.577. After inversion of the model based on soil hyperspectral and water content, the significance became 0.871 and 0.726, respectively, which can be used to predict soil salinity and water content. The spectral soil salinity model had a coefficient of 0.739 for soil salinity prediction. Among the salinity indices, the CRSI was selected as the most significant, with R-2 of 0.571, whereas the R-2 for PDI reached only 0.484. Among the vegetation indices, the ENDVI had the highest response to soil salinity, with R-2 of 0.577. After scale conversion, the correlation percentages between CRSI and measured soil salinity and between ENDVI and measured soil salinity increased to 16.2% and 8.5%, respectively. Following the correlation between PDI and soil water content, the percentage of correlation increased to 11.6%. The integration of hyperspectral remote sensing, ground methods and an inversion method for salinity is a very important and effective technique for rapid and nondestructive monitoring of soil salinization.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in breast cancer patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy: systematic review and meta-analysis about head to head comparison of cN0 and cN + patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose The effectiveness of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in axillary lymph node staging of breast cancer (BCa) patients with initial clinical node positive status (cN +) compared to clinical node negative status (cN0) is not yet known. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the accuracy of SLN mapping following NAC in cN + and cN0 BCa patients. Methods PubMed and Scopus were comprehensively reviewed to retrieve all the studies that performed SLN mapping/biopsy and standard axillary lymph node dissection on cN0 and cN + BCa patients following NAC. Pooled detection and false negative rates for N0 and N + patients including 95% confidence interval values (95% CI) were evaluated. Odds ratio (OR) and risk difference (RD) of SLN detection failure and false negative results were compared between two groups. Results A total of 27 articles were included for SLN detection rate evaluation and 17 for false negative assessment. The OR and RD of detection failure in N + group compared with N0 group following NAC were 2.22 (p = 0.00, 95% CI 1.4-3.4) and 4% (p = 0.00, 95% CI 2-6%), respectively. The OR and RD of false negative rate were 1.6 (p = 0.01, 95% CI 1-2.6) and 8% (p = 0.02, 95% CI 1-14%), respectively. Conclusion SLN mapping in BCa patients following NAC shows high risk of detection failure and high false negative rate of SLN biopsy in cN + patients. In comparison with cN0 BCa patients, SLN mapping and biopsy after NAC was associated with almost two times higher odds of detection failure and false negative results in cN + patients; therefore, this method should not be recommended in this group of patients.

TI  - Multi-temporal cloud detection based on robust PCA for optical remote sensing imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an essential pre-processing step for optical remote sensing imagery in various applications due to the huge negative effect of cloud occlusion. Multi-temporal cloud detection methods are usually more effective than single-image based methods by providing extra temporal information, which is a worthwhile supplement to spatial-spectral information for distinguishing clouds from clear-sky observations. Nevertheless, most of the existing multi-temporal cloud detection algorithms cannot estimate the cloud-free reference background accurately, especially when pixels have no or very few clear-sky observations in time series data, which limits the performance of cloud detection to a large degree. To deal with this problem, a novel multi-temporal cloud detection method based on robust principal component analysis (MCD-RPCA) is proposed for optical remote sensing imagery. Firstly, several spectral tests are performed to extract spectral features based on the physical attributes of clouds and obtain an initial rough cloud mask. Secondly, a low-rank matrix decomposition model, known as robust principal component analysis (RPCA), is constructed based on multi-temporal images to estimate the cloud-free background. By detecting the change between the cloudy image and the estimated clear-sky background image, a change cloud mask can be obtained by the extraction of temporal information. A refined cloud mask is then acquired by taking the intersection of the initial cloud mask and the change cloud mask. Lastly, multiple spatial morphological processing steps are implemented to incorporate the spatial information to further refine the cloud detection map. By fully exploiting the spectral-temporal-spatial features of clouds in optical remote sensing images, the proposed MCD-PRCA method seeks to facilitate the estimation of the clear background component and support the improved detection of cloudy pixels. The performance of MCD-RPCA was evaluated on four Landsat-8 OLI images from the Biome dataset and three popular cloud detection methods were used as benchmarks for comparisons. In general, a mean overall accuracy of 93.79% was achieved by the proposed MCD-RPCA method, outperforming the other state-of-the-art cloud detection algorithms.

TI  - Integration of maximum crop response with machine learning regression model to timely estimate crop yield
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable estimation of regional crop yield is a vital component of food security assessment, especially in developing regions. The traditional crop forecasting methods need ample time and labor to collect and process field data to release official yield reports. Satellite remote sensing data is considered a cost-effective and accurate way of predicting crop yield at pixel-level. In this study, maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) during the crop-growing season was integrated with Machine Learning Regression (MLR) models to estimate wheat and rice yields in Pakistan's Punjab province. Five MLR models were compared using a fivefold cross-validation method for their predictive accuracy. The study results revealed that the regression model based on the Gaussian process outperformed over other models. The best performing model attained coefficient of determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE, t/ha), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE, t/ha) of 0.75, 0.281, and 0.236 for wheat; 0.68, 0.112, and 0.091 for rice, respectively. The proposed method made it feasible to predict wheat and rice 6-8 weeks before the harvest. The early prediction of crop yield and its spatial distribution in the region can help formulate efficient agricultural policies for sustainable social, environmental, and economic progress.

TI  - ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING OF NATURAL ATMOSPHERIC HAZARDS (HEAVY RAINFALL) IN THE CITIES OF NORTHWESTERN IRAN USING SATELLITE DATA
T2  - CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hazards are involved in various factors and circumstances, including natural hazards such as heavy rainfall and floods. Various factors and situations are involved in the occurrence of natural hazards. These natural hazards include heavy rainfall and floods. In the present study, in order to evaluate the synoptic conditions for the occurrence of flood-induced rainfall in Khalkhal city, in Ardabil province, first the statistical data of 34 year rainfall was used from 1987- 2020. The most rainfall occurred in date 1991.09.12. The synoptic atmospheric maps of this date at the level of 500 mbar including sea level pressure map, geopotential elevation, wind speed and direction, humidity, temperature, surface rainfall and blocking (omega), using satellite imagery received and reviewed from the NCEP/NCAR database of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In this research, Environmental approach to Circulation method was used. Based on the results of the present research in the study of atmospheric synoptic maps showed that in addition to atmospheric and terrestrial conditions effective in causing heavy rainfall in the study date, the internal situation with an external pattern such as the surrounding seas and neighboring Iran such as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean has had an impact. The amount of monthly rainfall of Khalkhal station as a region in the south of Ardabil province and southwest of the Caspian Sea, with more rainfall in the three months of spring including March (1321.8 mm), April (1716.7 mm) and May (1448.5 mm). The highest natural atmospheric hazards due to heavy rains and floods in the study area were urban, rural, riversides and agricultural damages in the mentioned months. The maximum and minimum rainfall are 51 and 4.5 kg/m2, respectively, but in the study area, the curve shows the number 20 kg/m2 and this indicates the formation of super heavy rainfall. The observable temperature values with Kelvin criterion in the study area were significant, the maximum and minimum values are 265 and 245 degrees Kelvin, respectively.

TI  - Using MODIS-NDVI Time Series to Quantify the Vegetation Responses to River Hydro-Geomorphology in the Wandering River Floodplain in an Arid Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation, hydrology and geomorphology are three major elements of the floodplain ecosystem on Earth. Although the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been used extensively to characterize floodplain vegetation growth, vigour and biomass, methods for quantifying the various distinct responses of floodplain vegetation to hydro-geomorphological changes in different lateral belts in arid regions are still needed. In this study, the Linhe reach was divided into four lateral belts based on their hydro-geomorphological characteristics, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-NDVI time series statistical indicators were used to characterise the distinct changing the patterns of vegetation growth in different belts. The response of floodplain vegetation to river hydro-geomorphology in each belt was analysed. The result showed that the average maximum NDVI value in the regular inundation area was 0.23 and higher than that in the other lateral belts. The correlation between the water persistence time and peak NDVI value in the regular water inundation area was significant (rho = 0.84), indicating that in contrast to highly frequent or extremely rare water inundation, regular water inundation provides significant benefits to floodplains. Continuous or highly frequent inundation may cause decreased vegetation productivity. Overall, our results suggest that the vegetation greenness response to the river hydro-geomorphology is different from the river to the edge of the floodplain. Thus, a better understanding of the interactions between the floodplain vegetation and river hydro-morphology and river water resource management in arid-region floodplains.

TI  - Structure and Heat Transfer in Zircaloy-4 Treated at High Temperatures
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Zircaloy-4 has an important role in the construction of generation III nuclear reactors. An important application is the fuel element sheath, which must have excellent corrosion resistance in the working environment, adequate mechanical characteristics and very good heat transfer properties from the combustible element to the coolant. The corrosion processes at high temperatures, the accidents that lead to significant increases in temperature and the structural transformations associated with them affect the heat transfer process. The paper presents research on the influence of high temperatures on the microstructure and thermal diffusivity of the zy-4 alloy. The samples were treated in air, at temperatures between 850 and 1050 degrees C for 60 min. The corrosion layers were characterized microstructurally and chemically. Furthermore, the transformations produced in the base material under the corrosion layer were analyzed. The values of thermal diffusivity were determined and correlated with the structural transformations. Considering the state of research on the materials appropriate to be used for new generation reactors, the current importance of third-generation reactors for energy systems and the fact that they will operate in the coming years, we consider that the study offers useful outcomes in the field of nuclear energy.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping from Colorized CORONA Archived Greyscale Satellite Data and Feature Extraction Classification
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping is often performed via satellite or aerial multispectral/hyperspectral datasets. This paper explores new potentials for the characterisation of land cover from archive greyscale satellite sources by using classification analysis of colourised images. In particular, a CORONA satellite image over Larnaca city in Cyprus was used for this study. The DeOldify Deep learning method embedded in the MyHeritage platform was initially applied to colourise the CORONA image. The new image was then compared against the original greyscale image across various quality metric methods. Then, the geometric correction of the CORONA coloured image was performed using common ground control points taken for aerial images. Later a segmentation process of the image was completed, while segments were selected and characterised for training purposes during the classification process. The latest was performed using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Five main land cover classes were selected: land, water, salt lake, vegetation, and urban areas. The overall results of the classification process were then evaluated. The results were very promising (>85 classification accuracy, 0.91 kappa coefficient). The outcomes show that this method can be implemented in any archive greyscale satellite or aerial image to characterise preview landscapes. These results are improved compared to other methods, such as using texture filters.

T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lagos lagoon is continually being subjected to all forms of pollution. Human activities like industrialization, agriculture, and oil exploration are constantly threatening the health of this aquatic ecosystem. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and mono-aromatic hydrocarbons-benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are chemicals derived from fossil fuels that easily get into the aquatic environment. These chemicals were investigated in the fish parasite Tenuisentis niloticus, as a reflection of the extent to which these compounds are present in the lagoon. One hundred (100) samples of Heterotis niloticus were investigated for parasitic infection for a duration of six months, while the parasites encountered were used as sentinel organisms to check for the presence of PAH and BTEX. GC-MS was used to analyse for the presence of these chemicals, while parasite identification was done using conventional method. Only one parasite species, Teneuisentis niloticus, an acanthocephalan was recovered. There was 72% infection prevalence. The result also revealed that both BTEX and PAHs were accumulated in the body of the parasite. Two components of BTEX, (1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,3-dichlorobenzene) and five PAH congeners-Acenaphthylene, Phenanthrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene were not detected in the parasite. Total BTEX and PAH concentrations in the parasite was 47.45 +/- 7.68 and 135.12 +/- 2.547, respectively. There are ecotoxic concerns in the surroundings of the lagoon and human activities that aid it should be checked.

TI  - Monitoring of land use/land cover changes using GIS and CA-Markov modeling techniques: a study in Northern Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study, covering the northern Ulus district of Turkey, was to analyze the forest and land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the past period from 2000 to 2020, and to predict the possible changes in 2030 and 2040, using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) together with the CA-Markov model. The maximum likelihood classified (MLC) technique was used to produce LULC maps, using 2000 and 2010 Landsat (ETM +) and 2020 Landsat (OLI) images based on existing stand-type maps as reference. Using the historical data from the generated LULC maps, the LULC changes for 2030-2040 were predicted via the CA-Markov hybrid model. The reliability of the model was verified by overlapping the 2020 LULC map with the 2020 LULC model (predicted) map. The overall accuracy was found to be 80.90%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.74. The total forest area (coniferous + broad-leaved + mixed forest) grew by 10,656.4 ha (15.4%) in the 2000-2020 period. Examination of the types within the Forest Class revealed that the coniferous forest area had grown by 5.9% in the period 2000-2010, whereas it had decreased by 4.7% in the period 2010-2020. The broad-leaved forest area had grown by 1.2% and 3.1%, respectively, between 2000 and 2010 and 2010 and 2020. The mixed forest area had been reduced by 7.1% in the period 2000-2010 but had grown by 1.7% in the 2010-2020 period. In the Non-Forest Class, although the water area had increased in the 2000-2020 period, agricultural land and settlement areas had decreased by 11,553.9 ha (32.3%) and 34.6 ha (0.5%), respectively. According to the 2020-2040 LULC simulation results, it was predicted that there would be 3.8% and 26.4% growth in the total forest and water surface areas and 13.9% and 5.3% reduction in the agricultural and settlement areas, respectively. Using the LULC simulation to separate the Forest Class into coniferous, broad-leaved, and mixed forest categories and subsequently examining the individual changes can be of great help to forest planners and managers in decision-making and strategy development.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection in SAR Images Using Online Extended Variational Learning of Dirichlet Process Mixtures of Gamma Distributions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model of Gamma distributions, which is an extension of the finite Gamma mixture model to the infinite case. In particular, we propose a novel online nonparametric Bayesian analysis method based on the infinite Gamma mixture model where the determination of the number of clusters is bypassed via an infinite number of mixture components. The proposed model is learned via an online extended variational Bayesian inference approach in a flexible way where the priors of model's parameters are selected appropriately and the posteriors are approximated effectively in a closed form. The online setting has the advantage to allow data instances to be treated in a sequential manner, which is more attractive than batch learning especially when dealing with massive and streaming data. We demonstrated the performance and merits of the proposed statistical framework with a challenging real-world application namely oil spill detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.

TI  - InSAR Coherence Analysis for Wetlands in Alberta, Canada Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are valuable natural resources which provide numerous services to the environment. Many studies have demonstrated the potential of various types of remote sensing datasets and techniques for wetland mapping and change analysis. However, there are a relatively low number of studies that have investigated the application of the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence products for wetland studies, especially over large areas. Therefore, in this study, coherence products over the entire province of Alberta, Canada (similar to 661,000 km(2)) were generated using the Sentinel-1 data acquired from 2017 to 2020. Then, these products along with large amount of wetland reference samples were employed to assess the separability of different wetland types and their trends over time. Overall, our analyses showed that coherence can be considered as an added value feature for wetland classification and monitoring. The Treed Bog and Shallow Open Water classes showed the highest and lowest coherence values, respectively. The Treed Wetland and Open Wetland classes were easily distinguishable. When analyzing the wetland subclasses, it was observed that the Treed Bog and Shallow Open Water classes can be easily discriminated from other subclasses. However, there were overlaps between the signatures of the other wetland subclasses, although there were still some dates where these classes were also distinguishable. The analysis of multi-temporal coherence products also showed that the coherence products generated in spring/fall (e.g., May and October) and summer (e.g., July) seasons had the highest and lowest coherence values, respectively. It was also observed that wetland classes preserved coherence during the leaf-off season (15 August-15 October) while they had relatively lower coherence during the leaf-on season (i.e., 15 May-15 August). Finally, several suggestions for future studies were provided.

TI  - Retrieving Crop Albedo Based on Radar Sentinel-1 and Random Forest Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agricultural crops is of paramount importance for preserving water resources and increasing water efficiency over semi-arid areas. This can be achieved by modelling the water resources all along the growing season through the coupled water-surface energy balance. Surface albedo is a key land surface variable to constrain the surface radiation budget and hence the coupled water-surface energy balance. In order to capture the hydric status changes over the growing season, optical remote sensing becomes impractical due to cloud cover in some periods, especially over irrigated winter crops in semi-arid regions. To fill the gap, this paper aims to generate cloudless surface albedo product from Sentinel-1 data that offers a source of high spatio-temporal resolution images. This can help to better capture the vegetation development along the growth season through the surface radiation budget. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was implemented using Sentinel-1 backscatters as input. The approach was tested over an irrigated semi-arid zone in Morocco, which is known by its heterogeneity in term of soil conditions and crop types. The obtained results are evaluated against Landsat-derived albedo with quasi-concurrent Landsat/Sentinel-1 overpasses (up to one day offset), while a further validation was investigated using in situ field scale albedo data. The best model-hyperparameters selection was dependent on two validation approaches (K-fold cross-validation 'k = 10', and holdout). The more robust and accurate model parameters are those that represent the best statistical metrics (root mean square error 'RMSE', bias and correlation coefficient 'R'). Coefficient values ranging from 0.70 to 0.79 and a RMSE value between 0.0002 and 0.00048 were obtained comparing Landsat and predicted albedo by RF method. The relative error ratio equals 4.5, which is acceptable to predict surface albedo.

TI  - Integrating Multi-Sensors Data for Species Distribution Mapping Using Deep Learning and Envelope Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of ecological and atmospheric characteristics for biodiversity management is fundamental for long-term ecosystem conservation and drafting forest management strategies, especially in the current era of climate change. The explicit modelling of regional ecological responses and their impact on individual species is a significant prerequisite for any adaptation strategy. The present study focuses on predicting the regional distribution of Rhododendron arboreum, a medicinal plant species found in the Himalayan region. Advanced Species Distribution Models (SDM) based on the principle of predefined hypothesis, namely BIOCLIM, was used to model the potential distribution of Rhododendron arboreum. This hypothesis tends to vary with the change in locations, and thus, robust models are required to establish nonlinear complex relations between the input parameters. To address this nonlinear relation, a class of deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better fit the occurrence scenarios of the species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS. The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68 with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for species distribution over BIOCLIM.

TI  - Leaf Area Index Variations in Ecoregions of Ardabil Province, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation biophysical index that provides broad information on the dynamic behavior of an ecosystem's productivity and related climate, topography, and edaphic impacts. The spatiotemporal changes of LAI were assessed throughout Ardabil Province-a host of relevant plant communities within the critical ecoregion of a semi-arid climate. In a comparative study, novel data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) was tested against traditional ENVI measures to provide LAI estimations. Moreover, it is of important practical significance for institutional networks to quantitatively and accurately estimate LAI, at large areas in a short time, and using appropriate baseline vegetation indices. Therefore, LAI was characterized for ecoregions of Ardabil Province using remote sensing indices extracted from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), including the Enhanced Vegetation Index calculated in GEE (EVIG) and ENVI5.3 software (EVIE), as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index estimated in ENVI5.3 software (NDVIE). Moreover, a new field measurement method, i.e., the LaiPen LP 100 portable device (LP 100), was used to evaluate the accuracy of the derived indices. Accordingly, the LAI was measured in June and July 2020, in 822 ground points distributed in 16 different ecoregions-sub ecoregions having various plant functional types (PFTs) of the shrub, bush, and tree. The analyses revealed heterogeneous spatial and temporal variability in vegetation indices and LAIs within and between ecoregions. The mean (standard deviation) value of EVIG, EVIE, and NDVIE at a province scale yielded 1.1 (0.41), 2.20 (0.78), and 3.00 (1.01), respectively in June, and 0.67 (0.37), 0.80 (0.63), and 1.88 (1.23), respectively, in July. The highest mean values of EVIG-LAI, EVIE-LAI, and NDVIE-LAI in June are found in Meshginshahr (1.40), Meshginshahr (2.80), and Hir (4.33) ecoregions and in July are found in Andabil ecoregion respectively with values of 1.23, 1.5, and 3.64. The lowest mean values of EVIG-LAI, EVIE-LAI, and NDVIE-LAI in June were observed for Kowsar (0.67), Meshginshahr (1.8), and Neur (2.70) ecoregions, and in July, the Bilesavar ecoregion, respectively, with values of 0.31, 0.31, and 0.81. High correlation and determination coefficients (r > 0.83 and R-2 > 0.68) between LP 100 and remote sensing derived LAI were observed in all three PFTs (except for NDVIE-LAI in June with r = 0.56 and R-2 = 0.31). On average, all three examined LAI measures tended to underestimate compared to LP 100-LAI (r > 0.42). The findings of the present study could be promising for effective monitoring and proper management of vegetation and land use in the Ardabil Province and other similar areas.

TI  - Mapping Invasive <i>Phragmites australis</i> Using Unoccupied Aircraft System Imagery, Canopy Height Models, and Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant species are an increasing worldwide threat both ecologically and financially. Knowing the location of these invasive plant infestations is the first step in their control. Surveying for invasive Phragmites australis is particularly challenging due to limited accessibility in wetland environments. Unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) are a popular choice for invasive species management due to their ability to survey challenging environments and their high spatial and temporal resolution. This study tested the utility of three-band (i.e., red, green, and blue; RGB) UAS imagery for mapping Phragmites in the St. Louis River Estuary in Minnesota, U.S.A. and Saginaw Bay in Michigan, U.S.A. Iterative object-based image analysis techniques were used to identify two classes, Phragmites and Not Phragmites. Additionally, the effectiveness of canopy height models (CHMs) created from two data types, UAS imagery and commercial satellite stereo retrievals, and the RADARSAT-2 horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization were tested for Phragmites identification. The highest overall classification accuracy of 90% was achieved when pairing the UAS imagery with a UAS-derived CHM. Producer's accuracy for the Phragmites class ranged from 3 to 76%, and the user's accuracies were above 90%. The Not Phragmites class had user's and producer's accuracies above 88%. Inclusion of the RADARSAT-2 HH polarization caused a slight reduction in classification accuracy. Commercial satellite stereo retrievals increased commission errors due to decreased spatial resolution and vertical accuracy. The lowest classification accuracy was seen when using only the RGB UAS imagery. UAS are promising for Phragmites identification, but the imagery should be used in conjunction with a CHM.

TI  - Earth Observation for Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification within Environmental Land Management Policy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of the new agricultural scheme, Environmental Land Management, in England is to reward landowners based on their provision of 'public goods' while achieving the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan and commitment to net zero emission by 2050. Earth Observation (EO) satellites appear to offer an unprecedented opportunity in the process of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of this scheme. In this study, we worked with ecologists to determine the habitat-species relationships for five wildlife species in the Surrey Hills 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty' (AONB), and this information was used to examine the extent to which EO satellite imagery, particularly very high resolution (VHR) imagery, could be used for habitat assessment, via visual interpretation and automated methods. We show that EO satellite products at 10 m resolution and other geospatial datasets enabled the identification and location of broadly suitable habitat for these species and the use of VHR imagery (at 1-4 m spatial resolution) allowed valuable insights for remote assessment of habitat qualities and quantity. Hence, at a fine scale, we obtained additional habitats such as scrub, hedges, field margins, woodland and tree characteristics, and agricultural practices that offer an effective source of information for sustainable land management. The opportunities and limitations of this study are discussed, and we conclude that there is considerable scope for it to offer valuable information for land management decision-making and as support and evidence for MRV for incentive schemes.

TI  - Constructing 10-m NDVI Time Series From Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) carries valuable information related to the photosynthetic activity of vegetation and is essential for monitoring phenological changes and ecosystem dynamics. The medium to high spatial resolution satellite images from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 offer opportunities to generate dense NDVI time series at 10-m resolution to improve our understanding of the land surface processes. However, synergistic use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 for generating frequent and consistent NDVI data remains challenging as they have different spatial resolutions and spectral response functions. In this letter, we developed an attentional super resolution convolutional neural network (ASRCNN) for producing 10-m NDVI time series through fusion of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. We evaluated its performance in two heterogeneous areas. Quantitative assessments indicated that the developed network outperforms five commonly used fusion methods [i.e., enhanced deep convolutional spatiotemporal fusion network (EDCSTFN), super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM), and flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF)]. The influence of the method selection on the fusion accuracy is much greater than that of the fusion strategy in blending Landsat-Sentinel NDVI. Our results illustrate the advantages and potentials of the deep learning approaches on satellite data fusion.

TI  - Alsat-2B/Sentinel-2 Imagery Classification Using the Hybrid Pigeon Inspired Optimization Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification is a substantial operation in data mining, and each element is distributed taking into account its feature values in the corresponding class. Metaheuristics have been widely used in attempts to solve satellite image classification problems. This article proposes a hybrid approach, the flower pigeons-inspired optimization algorithm (FPIO), and the local search method of the flower pollination algorithm is integrated into the pigeon-inspired algorithm. The efficiency and power of the proposed FPIO approach are displayed with a series of images, supported by computational results that demonstrate the cogency of the proposed classification method on satellite imagery. For this work, the Davies-Bouldin Index is used as an objective function. FPIO is applied to different types of images (synthetic, Alsat-2B, and Sentinel-2). Moreover, a comparative experiment between FPIO and the genetic algorithm genetic algorithm is conducted. Experimental results showed that GA outperformed FPIO in matters of time computing. However, FPIO provided better quality results with less confusion. The overall experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is an efficient method for satellite imagery classification.

TI  - Combining Methods to Estimate Post-Fire Soil Erosion Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing number of wildfires in southern Europe is making our ecosystem more vulnerable to water erosion; i.e., the loss of vegetation and subsequent runoff increase cause a shift in large quantities of sediment. Fire severity has been recognized as one of the most important parameters controlling the magnitude of post-fire soil erosion. In this paper, we adopted a combination of methods to easily assess post-fire erosion and prevent potential risk in subsequent rain events. The model presented is structured into three modules that were implemented in a GIS environment. The first module estimates fire severity with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) method; the second estimates runoff with rainfall depth-duration curves and the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method; and the third estimates pre- and post-fire soil erosion. In addition, two post-fire scenarios were analyzed to assess the influence of fire severity on soil erosion: the former based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the latter on the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Index (RdNBR). The results obtained in both scenarios are quite similar and demonstrate that transitional areas, such as rangelands and rangelands with bush, are the most vulnerable because they show a significant increase in erosion following a fire event. The study findings are of secondary importance to the combined approach devised because the focal point of the study is to create the basis for a future tool to facilitate decision making in landscape management.

TI  - NOAA Image Data Acquisition to Determine Soil Moisture in Arequipa, Peru
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, irrigations have been built on dry areas in Majes-Arequipa. Over time, the irrigations water forms moist areas in lower areas, which can have positive or negative consequences. Therefore, it is important to know in advance where the water from the new irrigation will appear. The limited availability of real-time satellite image data is still a hindrance to some applications. Data from environmental satellites National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are available fee and license free. In order to receive data, users must obtain necessary equipment. In this work, we present a satellite data acquisition system with an RealTek (RTL) software-defined radio (SDR) receiver, two 137-138-MHz designed antennas, and Orbitron, SDRSharp, WXtolMG, and MATLAB softwares. We have designed two antennas: a turnstile crossed dipole antenna with Balun and a quadrifilar helicoidal antenna. The antennas' parameter measurements show very good correspondence with those obtained by simulation. The RTL SDR RTL2832U receiver, combined with our antennas and software, forms the system for recording, decoding, editing, and displaying automatic picture transmission (APT) signals. The results show that the satellite image receptions are sufficiently clear and descriptive for further analysis.

TI  - Urban Overheating Assessment through Prediction of Surface Temperatures: A Case Study of Karachi, Pakistan
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate has been radically affected by the urbanization process in recent years. Karachi, Pakistan's economic hub, is also showing signs of swift urbanization. Owing to the construction of infrastructure projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and associated urbanization, Karachi's climate has been significantly affected. The associated replacement of natural surfaces by anthropogenic materials results in urban overheating and increased local temperatures leading to serious health issues and higher air pollution. Thus, these temperature changes and urban overheating effects must be addressed to minimize their impact on the city's population. For analyzing the urban overheating of Karachi city, LST (land surface temperature) is assessed in the current study, where data of the past 20 years (2000-2020) is used. For this purpose, remote sensing data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors were utilized. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model was utilized where the road density (RD), elevation, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are used as input parameters. Upon comparing estimated and measured LST, the values of mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 0.27 K, 0.237, and 0.15% for January, and 0.29 K, 0.261, and 0.13% for May, respectively. The low MAE, MSE, and MAPE values show a higher correlation between the predicted and observed LST values. Moreover, results show that more than 90% of the pixel data falls in the least possible error range of -1 K to +1 K. The MAE, MSE and MAPE values for Support Vector Regression (SVR) are 0.52 K, 0.453 and 0.18% and 0.76 K, 0.873, and 0.26%. The current model outperforms previous studies, shows a higher accuracy, and depicts greater reliability to predict the actual scenario. In the future, based on the accurate LST results from this model, city planners can propose mitigation strategies to reduce the harmful effects of urban overheating and associated Urban Heat Island effects (UHI).

TI  - Integrated Evaluation of Vegetation Drought Stress through Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coming decades, Bulgaria is expected to be affected by higher air temperatures and decreased precipitation, which will significantly increase the risk of droughts, forest ecosystem degradation and loss of ecosystem services (ES). Drought in terrestrial ecosystems is characterized by reduced water storage in soil and vegetation, affecting the function of landscapes and the ES they provide. An interdisciplinary assessment is required for an accurate evaluation of drought impact. In this study, we introduce an innovative, experimental methodology, incorporating remote sensing methods and a system approach to evaluate vegetation drought stress in complex systems (landscapes and ecosystems) which are influenced by various factors. The elevation and land cover type are key climate-forming factors which significantly impact the ecosystem's and vegetation's response to drought. Their influence cannot be sufficiently gauged by a traditional remote sensing-based drought index. Therefore, based on differences between the spectral reflectance of the individual natural land cover types, in a near-optimal vegetation state and divided by elevation, we assigned coefficients for normalization. The coefficients for normalization by elevation and land cover type were introduced in order to facilitate the comparison of the drought stress effect on the ecosystems throughout a heterogeneous territory. The obtained drought coefficient (DC) shows patterns of temporal, spatial, and interspecific differences on the response of vegetation to drought stress. The accuracy of the methodology is examined by field measurements of spectral reflectance, statistical analysis and validation methods using spectral reflectance profiles.

TI  - Tree species classification using Sentinel-2 imagery and Bayesian inference
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased temporal frequency of optical satellite data acquisitions provides a data stream that has the potential to improve land cover mapping, including mapping of tree species. However, for large area operational mapping, partial cloud cover and different image extents can pose challenges. Therefore, methods are needed to assimilate new images in a straightforward way without requiring a total spatial coverage for each new image. This study shows that Bayesian inference applied sequentially has the potential to solve this problem. To test Bayesian inference for tree species classification in the boreo-nemoral zone of southern Sweden, field data from the study area of Remningstorp (58?27?18.35?N, 13?39?8.03?E) were used. By updating class likelihood with an increasing number of combined Sentinel-2 images, a higher and more stable cross-validated overall accuracy was achieved. Based on a Mahalanobis distance, 23 images were automatically chosen from the period of 2016 to 2018 (from 142 images total). An overall accuracy of 87% (a Cohen?s kappa of 78.5%) was obtained for four tree species classes: Betula spp., Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, and Quercus robur. This application of Bayesian inference in a boreo-nemoral forest suggests that it is a practical way to provide a high and stable classification accuracy. The method could be applied where data are not always complete for all areas. Furthermore, the method requires less reference data than if all images were used for classification simultaneously.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach to an Enhanced Building Footprint and Road Detection in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of building footprints and road networks has many useful applications including the monitoring of urban development, real-time navigation, etc. Taking into account that a great deal of human attention is required by these remote sensing tasks, a lot of effort has been made to automate them. However, the vast majority of the approaches rely on very high-resolution satellite imagery (<2.5 m) whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps. Working with the limited spatial resolution provided by high-resolution satellite imagery such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) makes it hard to detect buildings and roads, since these labels may coexist within the same pixel. This paper focuses on this problem and presents a novel methodology capable of detecting building and roads with sub-pixel width by increasing the resolution of the output masks. This methodology consists of fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (at 10 m) together with OpenStreetMap to train deep learning models for building and road detection at 2.5 m. This becomes possible thanks to the usage of OpenStreetMap vector data, which can be rasterized to any desired resolution. Accordingly, a few simple yet effective modifications of the U-Net architecture are proposed to not only semantically segment the input image, but also to learn how to enhance the resolution of the output masks. As a result, generated mappings quadruplicate the input spatial resolution, closing the gap between satellite and aerial imagery for building and road detection. To properly evaluate the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, a data-set composed of 44 cities across the Spanish territory have been considered and divided into training and testing cities. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for sub-pixel width building and road detection following the proper methodology.

TI  - Using Multi-Temporal Satellite Data to Analyse Phenological Responses of Rubber (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>) to Climatic Variations in South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology derived from satellite data provides insights into vegetation responses to climate change. This method has overcome laborious and time-consuming manual ground observation methods. In this study, we assessed the influence of climate on phenological metrics of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) in South Sumatra, Indonesia, between 2010 and 2019. We modelled rubber growth through the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), using eight-day surface reflectance images at 250 m spatial resolution, sourced from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua satellites. The asymmetric Gaussian (AG) smoothing function was applied on the model in TIMESAT to extract three phenological metrics for each growing season: start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), and length of season (LOS). We then analysed the effect of rainfall and temperature, which revealed that fluctuations in SOS and EOS are highly related to disturbances such as extreme rainfall and elevated temperature. Additionally, we observed inter-annual variations of SOS and EOS associated with rubber tree age and clonal variability within plantations. The 10-year monthly climate data showed a significant downward and upward trend for rainfall and temperature data, respectively. Temperature was identified as a significant factor modulating rubber phenology, where an increase in temperature of 1 degrees C advanced SOS by similar to 25 days and EOS by similar to 14 days. These results demonstrate the capability of remote sensing observations to monitor the effects of climate change on rubber phenology. This information can be used to improve rubber management by helping to identify critical timing for implementation of agronomic interventions.

TI  - Performance Comparison of Oil Spill and Ship Classification from X-Band Dual- and Single-Polarized SAR Image Using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that the polarization characteristics in X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis can provide us with additional information for marine target classification and detection. Normally, dual-and single-polarized SAR images are acquired by SAR satellites, and then we must determine how accurate the marine mapping performance from dual-polarized (pol) images is versus the marine mapping performance from the single-pol images in a given machine learning model. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of single- and dual-pol SAR image classification achieved by the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN) models. The test image is a TerraSAR-X dual-pol image acquired from the 2007 Kerch Strait oil spill event. For this, 824,026 pixels and 1,648,051 pixels were extracted from the image for the training and test, respectively, and sea, ship, oil, and land objects were classified from the image by using the three machine learning methods. The mean f1-scores of the SVM, RF, and DNN models resulting from the single-pol image were approximately 0.822, 0.882, and 0.889, respectively, and those from the dual-pol image were about 0.852, 0.908, and 0.898, respectively. The performance improvement achieved by dual-pol was about 3.6%, 2.9%, and 1% in SVM, RF, and DNN, respectively. The DNN model had the best performance (0.889) in the single-pol test while the RF model was best (0.908) in the dual-pol test. The performance improvement was approximately 2.1% and not noticeable. If the condition that dual-pol images have two-times lower spatial resolution versus single-pol images in the azimuth direction is considered, a small improvement may not be valuable. Therefore, the results show that the performance improvement by X-band dual-pol image may be not remarkable when classifying the sea, ships, oil spills, and sea and land surfaces.

TI  - Shifting shoreline of the estuarine landscape in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shorelines act as indicators of coastal changes and help in assessing the effect of changing sea levels and river runoff on the shore. The East Godavari River Estuarine Ecosystem (EGREE) in Andhra Pradesh, India is an ecologically significant landscape and is host to the second largest contiguous mangrove forests in India. At the same time, it is also an upcoming complex for industrial developments. The rapid economic development of this coast makes it necessary to investigate the erosion and accretion of its shoreline so that decision-makers can be better informed. A temporal dataset of the shorelines in this coast between 1977 and 2015 was generated using visual interpretation of Landsat suite of satellite data. The shorelines could be generated with an annualised error of +/- 2.86 m/year. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a widely used tool to understand the behaviour of the shoreline, was used for estimating the erosion and accretion rates along different segments of the shoreline in EGREE. Based on the End Point Rate (EPR) statistic estimated through DSAS, the coastline was found to have eroded at a cumulative rate of 3.9 m/year between 1977 and 2015. The overall mean Linear Regression Rate (LRR) was found to be - 1.6 m/year. The erosional LRR was 9.8 m/year (LR2 = 0.68) and the accretional LRR was 8.2 m/year (LR2 = 0.69). The stretch between the mouth of Nilarevu distributary and Masanitippa was found to be the most dynamic stretch. Management decisions must take cognisance of the erosivity of the coast before burdening the coast with heavy developmental projects.

TI  - Comparison of Machine-Learning and CASA Models for Predicting Apple Fruit Yields from Time-Series Planet Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. "Fuji"), an important cash crop, is widely consumed around the world. Accurately predicting preharvest apple fruit yields is critical for planting policy making and agricultural management. This study attempted to explore an effective approach for predicting apple fruit yields based on time-series remote sensing data. In this study, time-series vegetation indices (VIs) were derived from Planet images and analyzed to further construct an accumulated VI (Sigma VIs)-based random forest (RF Sigma VI) model and a Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model for predicting apple fruit yields. The results showed that (1) Sigma NDVI was the optimal predictor to construct an RF model for apple fruit yield, and the R-2, RMSE, and RPD values of the RF Sigma NDVI model reached 0.71, 16.40 kg/tree, and 1.83, respectively. (2) The maximum light use efficiency was determined to be 0.499 g C/MJ, and the CASA(SR) model (R-2 = 0.57, RMSE = 19.61 kg/tree, and RPD = 1.53) performed better than the CASA(NDVI) model and the CASA(Average) model (R-2, RMSE, and RPD = 0.56, 24.47 kg/tree, 1.22 and 0.57, 20.82 kg/tree, 1.44, respectively). (3) This study compared the yield prediction accuracies obtained by the models using the same dataset, and the RF Sigma NDVI model (RPD = 1.83) showed a better performance in predicting apple fruit yields than the CASA(SR) model (RPD = 1.53). The results obtained from this study indicated the potential of the RF Sigma NDVI model based on time-series Planet images to accurately predict apple fruit yields. The models could provide spatial and quantitative information of apple fruit yield, which would be valuable for agronomists to predict regional apple production to inform and develop national planting policies, agricultural management, and export strategies.

TI  - Early detection of bark beetle infestation in Norway spruce forests of Central Europe using Sentinel-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, massive outbreaks of bark beetles (Ips spp.) have caused large-scale decline of coniferousdominated, prevailingly managed forests of Central Europe. Timely detection of newly infested trees is important for minimizing economic losses and effectively planning forest management activities to stop or at least slow outbreaks. With the advancement of Copernicus services, a pair of Sentinel-2 satellites provides a unique remote sensing data source of multi-temporal observations in high spatial resolution on the scale of individual forest stands (although not allowing for individual tree detection). This study investigates the potential for using seasonal trajectories of Sentinel-2 bands and selected vegetation indices in early detection of bark beetle infestation (so?called green-attack stage detection) in Norway spruce monoculture forests in the Czech Republic. Spectral trajectories of nine bands and six vegetation indices were constructed for the 2018 vegetation season using 14 satellite observations from April to November to distinguish four infestation classes. We used a random forest algorithm to classify healthy (i.e., stands not infested) and infested trees with various trajectories of decay. The seasonal trajectories of vegetation indices separated the infestation classes better than did the individual bands. Among the most promising vegetation indices we identified the tasselled cap wetness (TCW) component and normalized difference index constructed from near and shortwave infrared bands. Analysing the inter-annual change of the indices was more promising for early detection than is single-date classification. It achieved 96% classification accuracy on day of year 291 for the tested data set. The algorithm for early detection of tree infestation based on the assessment of seasonal changes in TCW was applied on the time series of Sentinel-2 observations from 2019 and its outputs were verified using field observations of forest conditions conducted on 80 spruce forest plots (located in spruce monoculture stands). The overall accuracy of 78% was achieved for the separation of healthy and green-attack classes. Our study highlights the great potential of multi-temporal remote sensing and the use of shortwave infrared wavelengths for early detection of spruce forest decline caused by bark beetle infestation.
